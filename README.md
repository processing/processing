Processing
==========

This is the official source code for the [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE), 
the “core” and the libraries that are included with the [download](http://processing.org/download). 

__I've found a bug!__ 
Let us know [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues) (after first checking if someone has already posted a similar problem). 
If it's a documentation, web site, or examples problem, take that up with folks [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues). 
There are also separate locations for [Android Mode](https://github.com/processing/processing-android/issues), or the [Video](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues) and [Sound](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues) libraries. 
The [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) project is not affiliated with us, but you can find their issue tracker [here](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/issues).

__That [processing-bugs](https://github.com/processing-bugs) fella is a damn liar.__ 
The issues list has been imported from Google Code, so there are many spurious references 
amongst them since the numbering changed. Basically, any time you see references to 
changes made by [processing-bugs](https://github.com/processing-bugs), it may be somewhat suspect.
Over time this will clean itself up as bugs are fixed and new issues are added from within Github.
Help speed this process along by helping us!

__Please help__
The instructions for building the source [are here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions). 
Please help us fix problems, and if you're submitting code, following the [style guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Style-Guidelines) helps save us a lot of time.

__And finally...__
Someday we'll also fix all these bugs, throw together hundreds of unit tests, and get rich off all this stuff that we're giving away for free. But not today. 

So in the meantime, I ask for your patience, 
[participation](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List), 
and [patches](https://github.com/processing/processing/pulls).
