Processing
==========

This is the official source code for the [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE), 
the “core” and the libraries that are included with the [download](http://processing.org/download). 

> If you need a stable version, use the source or tag for version [2.2.1](https://github.com/processing/processing/releases/tag/processing-0227-2.2.1) or [3.0a5](https://github.com/processing/processing/releases/tag/processing-0232-3.0a5).

> Development of Processing 3 has started, so major changes are underway inside this repository. Many things are broken at the moment while we sort it all out. Do not expect this code to be stable. 

> "Major changes" means possible breakage to libraries/tools/modes (as we make API changes) and the removal of `Applet` as the base class for PApplet. Some of these will be sorted out before the release, others are changes that will break some code between 2.x and 3.x. Obviously, we will work hard to break as few things as possible.

If you have found a bug in the Processing software, you can file it here under the [“issues” tab](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues). 
All Android-related development has moved to its own repository [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-android), 
so issues with Android Mode, or with the Android version of the core library should be posted there instead. The [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) project is not affiliated with us, but you can find their issue tracker [here](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/issues).

The issues list has been imported from Google Code, so there are many spurious references 
amongst them since the numbering changed. Basically, any time you see references to 
changes made by [processing-bugs](https://github.com/processing-bugs), it may be somewhat suspect.
Over time this will clean itself up as bugs are fixed and new issues are added from within Github.
Help speed this process along by helping us!

The [processing-docs](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/) repository contains reference, examples, and the site. 
(Please use that link to file issues regarding the web site, the examples, or the reference.)

The instructions for building the source [are here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions).

Someday we'll also ~~[write code style guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Style-Guidelines)~~, fix all these bugs, 
throw together hundreds of unit tests, 
and get rich off all this stuff that we're giving away for free.

But in the meantime, I ask for your patience, 
[participation](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List), 
and [patches](https://github.com/processing/processing/pulls).
