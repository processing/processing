# Processing

This is the official source code for the [Processing][processing site] Development Environment (PDE)
, the “core” and the libraries that are included with the [download][processing download].

**I've found a bug!**
Let us know [here][processing issue] (after first checking if someone has already posted a similar
problem).
If it's a documentation, web site, or examples problem, take that up with folks
[here][processing docs issue].
There are also separate locations for [Android Mode][processing android issue], or the
[Video][processing video issue] and [Sound][processing audio issue] libraries.
The [processing.js][processing.js site] project is not affiliated with us, but you can find their
issue tracker [here][processing.js issue].

**That [processing-bugs][processing-bugs] fella is a damn liar.**
The issues list has been imported from Google Code, so there are many spurious references
amongst them since the numbering changed. Basically, any time you see references to
changes made by [processing-bugs][processing-bugs], it may be somewhat suspect.
Over time this will clean itself up as bugs are fixed and new issues are added from within Github.
Help speed this process along by helping us!

**Please help.**
The instructions for building the source [are here][processing build instructions].
Please help us fix problems, and if you're submitting code, following the
[style guidelines][processing style guidelines] helps save us a lot of time.

**And finally...**
Someday we'll also fix all these bugs, throw together hundreds of unit tests, and get rich off all
this stuff that we're giving away for free. But not today.

So in the meantime, I ask for your patience, [participation][processing project list], and
[patches][processing pull requests].
