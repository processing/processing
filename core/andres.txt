0208 opengl 
X Make methods in PGL used by opengl protected, then remove gl from the public GL methods
X Texture wrapping option in PGraphics: textureWrap(mode)
X Unwrap GLException to avoid confusion when common, non-GL errors occur.

0208 video 
X Cleanup video API:

X Have Capture.list() return all supported resolutions, and use the string as the argument 
    for the capture object

0208 todo pre-beta:
_ Add DISABLE_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTED_STROKE hint, remove DISABLE_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTED_LINES  
_ Rename shader constants (FLAT, LIT, TEXTURED, etc), resetShader() w/out args?
_ Back-buffer support in shaders: http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1169
_ Issues on low-end phones: http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1145
_ Rotation problem on Android: http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1146

processing-core todo (post-beta):
_ Cleaner Implementation of PImage.loadPixels()
_ some glitches with SVG shapes in P2D (load world.svg and disable style to trigger)
_ simple bevel algorithm for retained mode tessellation 
_   if stroke weight is less than 1, the tessellator currently doesn't 
_   apply the path stroking algorithm, but a retained shape can be zoomed 
_   in to see the details of the strokes
_ setting smooth(n) in a non-interactive sketch has no effect.
_ Fix text rendering at non-integer coordinates. 
_   This might be useful: http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf
_ Implement manual mipmap generation to take care of missing extension
_ Beveling algorithm needs to add last bevel triangle between last and first vertex in closed loops.
_ Lines, points and fill geometry should be handled separately in raw output in P2D.
_ Use GL_LINES and GL_POINTS when stroke weight is below the hardware limit and stroke cap/bevel is RECT.
_ Properly handle very large stroke paths in P3D (create new index cache, etc).

processing-android todo (post-beta):
_ noLoop/redraw not working
_ Mipmaps are disabled, need manual generation
