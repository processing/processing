processing-core todo (after beta):
_ some glitches with SVG shapes in P2D 
_   load world.svg and disable style)
_ simple bevel algorithm for retained mode tessellation 
_   if stroke weight is less than 1, the tessellator currently doesn't 
_   apply the path stroking algorithm, but a retained shape can be zoomed 
_   in to see the details of the strokes
_ setting smooth(n) in a non-interactive sketch has no effect.
_ Fix text rendering at non-integer coordinates. 
_   This might be useful: http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf
_ Implement manual mipmap generation to take care of missing extension
_ Beveling algorithm needs to add last bevel triangle between last and first vertex in closed loops.
_ Lines, points and fill geometry should be handled separately in raw ouput in P2D.
_ Use GL_LINES and GL_POINTS when stroke weight is below the hardware limit and stroke cap/bevel is RECT.
_ Properly handle very large stroke paths in P3D (create new index cache, etc).

processing-android todo (after beta):
_ noLoop/redraw not working
_ Mipmaps are disabled, need manual generation
_ Issues on low-end phones: http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1145
