o many fonts installed causes slow startup on macos
o   run that on a thread, and make sure default font doesn't need the list loaded
X   can't be done, notes in the code for PFont.loadFonts()
X improve startup time when user-specified fonts are not used
X   default font will be faster, using ttf/otf is fine
X   only createFont("The Font Name") is still slow on macOS
X   and PFont.list()
o check again whether element 0,0 in a Table is working
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3011
X   was already checked, made a note and locked the issue

api changes
X Dict.remove() should return value, not index (for consistency w/ others)
X   returns the value removed, not the key, just like remove(key)
X   rationale being that if you know the index, you probably know the key
X   if unavailable, throw an exception; otherwise no consistent way to indicate error
X add circle() and square()
X add push() and pop()
X make JSONObject.quote() (both versions) public
X should DoubleDict create from Iterable or Map<>?
o   (Map is more efficient b/c of size, Iterable more useful)
X   Iterable of what, though? Map.Entry?
X   sticking with just the Map<> version for now

X move error messages out of PConstants (into PApplet? PGraphics?)
o replace sketchXxxx() methods with another mechanism?
o   and an internal dictionary that stores them all?
o   intParam(), stringParam() and setParam()?
o   or sketchInt() or settingsInt()?
o   surface.size(), surface.noSmooth()... just like PGraphics methods?
o   make final to move folks away from these?
o   or is this a bad move until we've sorted out Android?
X   HashMap sucks b/c we'd have to cast everything
X   doesn't help to have intParam() etc, too many types (5ish? OutputStream)
X   just stick with the current setup
X remove launch(String) since it was calling itself, and anachronistic

X Window never shows with exported application on 64-bit Linux
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3303
X present mode is now broken
o still some spinning when sketches break
X   fixed because we're back off the EDT
o settings() is probably not showing exceptions since we're back to the EDT
o   can't call handleSettings() on the anim thread since it sets the surface
o   so maybe the first part is on the EDT, but other threads run this stuff
X remove the init() method

X   closing as wontfix

retina fixes
X make g.pixelDensity public inside PApplet (so accessible by sketches)
o   or is it akin to g.fill and the rest?
X   it's in PApplet, but not public.. will be the same as g.pixelDensity
X add pixelWidth/Height to PApplet
X   add setSize() method for surfaces
X   tricky cuz we'll need a getter/setter when surface messes w/ things

cleaning
o keep Danger2D?
o   can't do version that draws to BufferStrategy directly
o   pixel operations (get/set/loadPixels/saveFrame) might be fixable
o   but can't re-run draw() to re-blit the screen
o     because we don't split calc() and draw()
o   even with the split, handleDraw() might need to live in PSurface
o   add calc() option? this could ease transition
X   decided to put efforts into JavaFX

breaking api
X re-opened the Gates of Hell by adding chaining operations to PVector
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/257
o add chaining operations to XML and JSON
X exec() and open() to use varargs
X   changed exec() to use varargs for convenience
X cross-language awkwardness
X   python has to use launch() instead of open()
X   changed open() to launch() to fix conflicts in Python (and elsewhere?)
o   map() is bad for Python and JavaScript

api decisions
o min() and max() to use varargs
o   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3027
X   not enough use cases here to make sense
o join() to use varargs
X   handling this in the Int/Float/StringList constructors instead
X   users can call new StringList(...).join(",") instead
X   make join() work with Iterable or Object... or both?
X   will this collide with the current String[] version?
o remove OPENGL constant (tell people to use P3D or P2D)
X   breaks too much code without really helping anything
o break PUtil out from PApplet
o   pro: weird to call PApplet for things like hex/join/etc
o   con: still lots of things like selectFolder() that need GUI
X   final: not enough functions to split out to have it truly make sense
X          or rather, doesn't clean up enough code that the mess is worthwhile

smooth and noSmooth
o add imageSmooth()?
o   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1272
X   decided no, again
X sketchQuality() vs sketchSmooth()?
X   'quality' is being removed since smoothing will be a one-time thing
X smooth() and noSmooth()
X   goes before the first beginDraw() with createGraphics()
X   sketchQuality() needs to be rooted out
X   don't make this final, since it'll break a bunch of code
X     it'd be a nice indicator for renderers, but not worth what it breaks

size, fullScreen, displays
X fix up handling of fullScreen()
X   https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/250
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3296
X   right now using a (display ignoring) hack to displayWidth/Height
X   maybe we use the AWT screen sizes first, then match the others w/ em?
X   --full-screen replaced with --present (to untangle things)
X     if you want full screen, use the fullScreen() method
X   --span removed as an option, better to just do this from code
X   docs: no mixing size() and fullScreen(). pick one.
X instead of all these sketchXxxx() methods, should we have sketchSetting()
o   too much soup inside main() to handle arg parsing and passing to the sketch
X   moved things to settings()
X split 'present' and 'full screen'?
X   --full-screen causes considerable flicker at this point
X   or split them when sketchWidth/Height are implemented?
X size() inside setup() can only have numbers
X   size() inside settings() is left alone and can do whatever it wants
X   comments are being removed before size() is getting checked
X     probably remove anything inside settings() as well?
X looks like we're off by 1 on monitor numbering

X add displayDensity() methods
X add pixelDensity() method

X the 2X thing on the renderer name is unnecessary
X   just do pixelFactor() (and pull it during compilation)?

o   and with that, encourage the use of the dummy frame object in renderers
X   dummy moved into PApplet itself
X add SVG export library
X add StringList(Object...) constructor
X size() is fairly broken for PDF and SVG or whatever
X   make size(300, 300, PDF) without implementing sketchXxx() methods work
X   this shouldn't be a huge thing, we're not going to set the window visible
X   until after setup() completes anyway (otherwise a delay w/ blank window)
X Sketch runs with default size if size() is followed by large memory allocation
X   some sort of threading issue happening here

o   also check this out with the new full screen code on OS X
o use enums for constants

X   nope, requires having ALIGN_LEFT instead of just LEFT
X clean up requestFocus() stuff
X   make sure it works with retina/canvas/strategy as well
X args[] should be null if none passed
X   otherwise args == null checks are weird
X saveFrame() from setup() gives a black screen when size() is called
X   as seen in the 'numbers' sketch
X   this was fixed earlier?
X fix flicker when resizing window
X   running through PSurfaceAWT.setSize() is probably overkill
o   setLocationRelativeTo(null) was removed, will it be missed?

data
X pop() was not implemented correctly
X add new String/Int/FloatDict constructors for easier initialization
X add appendUnique() to Int/Float/StringList
o add fromOrder() and others? otherwise need temp object:
o   categoryIndexLookup = new StringList(flavors).getOrder();
X   decided no:
X     not a huge deal to call getOrder() and deal w/ temp objects
X     likely to only be called only once during execution
X     it's only for StringList
X     in the end, not worth adding fromXxxx() syntax for single use

o   downside: breaks compatibility big time

earlier
X decision on registered methods
X   remove registerPre() et al
X   add register("pause", ...)
X   size() should be resize(), so it can be overridden (ala pause())
X   add PEvent
X need to wrap mouse/key events for p5
X   need a version that works with both android and desktop
X   also need to interleave events properly (as per report)

mouse wheel
X add mouse wheel support to 2.0 event system
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1461
X   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1423
X   this is fairly messy since desktop and JS behave a little differently
o   wheel event should subclass mouse (since position still relevant)
X     just another sub-event as part of mouse
o   might be more effort than it's worth?
X   peasycam uses e.getWheelRotation()
X   js has a couple versions
X     http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/onmousewheel.shtml
X     e.detail is 1 for 1 tick upward (away), -2 for 2 ticks down
X     e.wheelDelta is 120 for 1 click up, -240 for two clicks down
X     this is for non-natural! opposite of Java.. ugh
X testing with Java on OS X
X   natural on OS X: up is 1 unit, down is -1 units
X     non-natural: up is -1 units, down is +1 unit
X   Windows says 3 units per notch, OS X says just 1
X   appears to be opposite of JS
X   using float value (/120.0f)
X   high-precision method grabbed if 1.7 is in use
X   test with actual wheel mouse
X   test on Windows
X   decide on getAmount() and weirdness w/ clickCount
X   add note re: API docs
X     get mouseWheel() added to api ref
o     also added to keywords.txt
X   ref: "negative values if the mouse wheel was rotated up or away from the user"
X   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/event/MouseWheelEvent.html#getWheelRotation()
X   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/MouseWheelEvent.html#getWheelRotation()

data
X are we comfortable with setInt/Float/etc instead of just set(int, blah)
X   yes, better to have parity
X   too weird to have to explain why getXxx() needs types and set() doesn't
X get/set with Java's 'Map' class?
X   really useful, but leaning toward not including it
X   or leave it in as an advanced feature?
X createXxx() methods less important
X   XML.parse() - or new XML("<tag>") or new XML("tag")
X api note: size() used in data classes
X   length() too confusing w/ array.length being built-in (when to use ()?)
X   size() a bit confusing with the p5 size command, but less problematic
o   also shorter than getCount() or getLength()
o why not HashMap and ArrayList for JSON?
o   could enable loadHash() and loadArray() functions
X   because the types coming back out would always have to be cast
o add loadDict() and loadList() for JSON?
o   Dict and List could be interfaces?
X "hash.toJSONObject()" or "new JSONObject(hash)"
X   opted to use "new JSONObject" version, appears less awkward
o match? find? on StringList?
X naming for descending sort
o   rsort(), sortReverse(), sortKeysReverse,
o   sortDescend, sortDescending, sortKeysDescending,
o   sortHighLow, sortHigh, sortHighest, sortDown
X   sortReverse() is the final decision

data / document
X no save/load for hash and list classes
X   because no native format
X   write() and constructor are enough for advanced users
o add() to add things to lists, inc/dec for the math
o   inc/dec/sum is used less, after all
X   or append()? since that's what JSON is currently using
X   append() nicer, inc/dec felt arcane (and forced)
o Lookup instead of Hash or Dict?
o increment, decrement, increase, decrease instead of add/subtract
o   does double duty for incrementing/decrementing easily
o   inc(), inc(amount), dec(), dec(amount)
X replace (especially for null and NaN)
X   make note that these work, and are special cases
o listAttributes() in XML is like array from keys() etc in our data classes
X removeIndex() vs removeValue() vs remove()
X   remove() refers to an index (with array) or key (with hash)
X   more consistent with other APIs (Java)
X   replaceValue[s]() the same, though more on the line
o   should we not have remove() and removeIndex()
o     and instead always specify? removeKey(), removeIndex(), removeValue()?
o     would mean that hash would only have removeKey
o     downside: remove() takes whatever get() takes as arg
X   with removeValue(), add removeValues() for all values that match?
X     also support NaN here
X need to sort out the final version of hash/dict/etc and their names
X JSONObject.has(key) vs XML.hasAttribute(attr) vs HashMap.containsKey()
X   and how it should be handled with hash/dict
X   right now using hasKey().. in JSONObject
o   contains() as default, then containsValue() as the alternate
o     instead of containsKey() and containsValue()
X   hasAttribute in XML, containsKey in java's Map, hasKey in JSON
X   hasChildren() is another precedent
o   contains() is nice, but containsKey() is weird, often not 'containing'
X   hasKey/hasValue is best; fewest changes and most descriptive

json
X loadJSONArray, loadJSONObject
X getIntArray() for JSONArray
X misc bugs with last release
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1660
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1680
X Dan having trouble with JSON
X keys() vs keySet() in JSON..
X   keys() doesn't iterate, keySet() introduces 'Set' type
X parseJSONObject(x) and parseJSONArray(x)

table
X do we need getColumnType() inside TableRow?
X   also inside Table
X   also do we make the constants public?
X table writing twice when .csv is added
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1734
X checkOptions() is a mess.. need to use different options for load/save
X   rewrite it as necessary
X implement binary tables
X   these might be partially set
o add .gz as option for writing (and bz2?)
X   handling gz properly, but gz has to be the extension
X   adding it to options is too messy
o add 'gz' as one of the loadXxx() options
o   helps .svgz case from being weird, also generally dealing w/ compressed data
X include SQL, HTML, ODS, binary?
X   decide on TableODS, TableHTML
X   HTML is out--too confusing
X   ODS is in for loading, and finished
o   naming HTMLTable, TableHTML (ala PShapeSVG)
o   or should it be HTMLTable / HtmlTable... then SVGShape / SvgShape
X   SQL can be done with a constructor
X   this will just be available for advanced users
X getColumnType() - what should it return?
o   Integer.TYPE, String.class? still nothing for categorical
o   maybe it's Table.INT since it's for advanced users anyway
o   problem is loading types from file, no way to access it from code
o   CATEGORICAL -> CATEGORY? ORDINAL?
X add clearRows()
X improve load/save of .gz files with Table, clear up some .bin issues

xml
o add nodes() (no) or children() to XML?
X   not necessary, getChildren() already exists

o hint(OPENGL_ERRORS) should be the opposite to enable the reporting, no?
o   hint(ENABLE_OPENGL_ERRORS) should be the hint.. disabled by default
X   nah, just leave these turned on since (potentially) important
X fix table loading quirk with extensions
o full screen not auto-enabling with displayWidth/Height
X   Opting not to do this, because we can't remove the decorations on the
X   window at this point. And re-opening a new winodw is a lot of mess.
X   Better all around to just encourage the use of sketchFullScreen()
X   or cmd/ctrl-shift-R in the PDE.
X make notes about methods removed from JSON to be conservative
X remove default findNative() that was enabling native fonts w/ p5
o when using loadFont(), don't enable native fonts unless hint() in use
o   but on createFont(), we're probably OK
o   might need to make reference notes about the two behaviors
X   decision: remove hint(ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS)
X PImage.resize() greater than image size hangs
X   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1463
X   turns out to be errata from the book
X add warning message when registering AWT mouse/key events
X   don't let OpenGL fire those mouse events at all
X   phrase the warning differently when OpenGL is in use (or only show then?)
X   halt with OpenGL, otherwise will be ignored
X show warning when registering mouse/key events with OpenGL
X deprecate mouseEvent and keyEvent
X add functions for mousePressed(event) and keyPressed(event) et al
X   better to do this instead of bringing back the magic event
X   or implementing the magic event on Android
X   also problematic with it not being called now
X loadBytes does not close input stream

X remove SVG warning about "#text" ignored
X fix bug where noDelays wasn't being used in PApplet
X remove "ignoring #text tag" from SVG loader
X   can ignore any # items altogether
o add "CGAffineTransformInvert: singular matrix" problem to the Wiki

o   there's nothing really ALPHA about them?
o bit shifting in opengl, get down to 2 ops by using other image modes
o   i.e. ABGR_EXT might allow for just two shifts instead of 4
o allow access to native pixel buffer in opengl and power of 2
o   so that no need to copy/update everything
o how to handle gluTessVertex calls
o   need to re-map through the regular "vertex" command,
o   but that makes things messy because the glu calls make calls to vertex()
o   and i don't want an additional "pathVertex()" function
o with opengl optimizations via call lists..
o   watch out to make sure raw recording still works
o   (optimizations will have to be disabled to some extent)
o look into using glu quadrics to handle shape geometries quickly
o optimizations to opengl
o   disabling error reporting (what's taking it so long?)
o     maybe use a hint() to enable it? or a getError() function?
o   make cached display list of filled/non-filled ellipse.. rect.. etc
o     these don't work when the vertex colors change, but..
o   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=657
o   or maybe should be using vertex arrays?
o maybe break out a separate timage object in textures?
o   needs tindex and tbuffer, both gl specific
o     and for tpixels and twidth/theight, could use another PImage
o   under assumption that most will just need an extra image object
o   this could also be used by people eventually to control tex themselves
o   or maybe call the object "texture"?
o   in opengl lib, need beginTexture(PImage) and endTexture()
o   this will be helpful to have access to the raw texture data
o   that way it can be re-bound by itself, and ppl can write directly to it
o make textMode(SHAPE) faster in opengl
o   cache for type should be per-renderer
o   make the opengl textmode shape stuff get better and use PShape
o   because opengl needs vectors, but also the image cache for textures

decisions
o call reapplySettings() when using beginRecord()?
X   nope, won't work for many fonts, can't get the background
X   should beginRecord inherit settings from its parent renderer?
X     textFont() is null on beginRecord
X     same would be the case for strokeWeight, background, etc.
X   add note to begin/endRecord, that settings are not inherited
X     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=346
o     or actually inherit the settings
X   decision: too many minor glitches possible, just note in the ref
X     i.e. some fonts don't work with PDF, or bg color can't be re-set
X clean up filter stuff?
X   filter(GRAY) -> to push things to luminosity-based gray
X     already implemented this way
o   filter(MASK, ...) -> or ALPHA?
o   filter(TINT, tintColor)
X   decision: use luminosity for gray
X   decision: tinting is usually for a dynamic thing, so not necessary
o change default save() to use PNG instead of TIFF (speed?)
o   decision: due to speed, just keep it as TIFF
o clipping
o   http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/experiments/borg/render/index.html
o   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clip_Mapping
o   http://www.cubic.org/docs/3dclip.htm
o perspective() applied after camera()... problems?
o make sure that filter, blend, copy, etc say that no loadPixels necessary
o add java.io.Reader (and Writer?) to imports
X binary() auto-sizes, hex() does not
X   decision: remove auto-sizing from binary
X remove delay()
X   if you really want it, you can use Thread.sleep()
X thread() and method()
X   thread() method (web workers?)
X   decision: add thread, method isn't great
X   oops: method() is just used by thread
X PImage.save() should return a success boolean
X   and not throw an exception when it fails
o cmyk version of tiff encoder code?
o illustrator export / rendering mode
o   also postscript or pdf export?
o   update illustrator code to use core api

o   http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/hobby93practical.html
o textMode(SHAPE) and textMode(IMAGE)?
o   textMode(SCREEN) is out of its league?
o textMode(SHAPE) and hint(SMOOTHING) calls are really awkward
o   maybe need to add properties to the size() command?
o   or use a getXxxx() method?
o in PShape, getChild(name) refers to a <blah id="name">
o   however in an XML file, that's <name ...>, meaning the name of the tag
o   change it to getShape(name)? also for fonts getShape(char c)
o   decision: use getShape() (maybe add getShapeCount and getShape(int))
o     and remove getChild() from PShape
o   oops: getParent() is in there, as is getChildren() and others...
o   svg examples should use getShape(name) not getChild(name)
X   better to not break the naming, since getParent() needs to stay
X   nobody felt strongly enough about getShape()
X   so better to not change (and start breaking things)

xml changes
X see if write() is necessary inside PNodeXML
o   it needs a proper header on it, so maybe that's the difference w/ toString()
X   verified that toString() also writes a header
o inefficient: the way new nodes are created
o also inefficient: adding/removing kids just nukes the children array
X toString() adds the XML header
X move to new XML library
X   add XHTML parsing or any others?
X   html parser? javax.swing.text.html.parser... has binary DTDs
X   decision: it's someone else's job

X   no, because it's too processor intensive to draw a lotta ellipses
X   but added a note about it to the reference for 0151
X strokeWeight() doesn't work in opengl or p3d
o gl smoothing.. how to disable polygon but keep line enabled
o   or at least make a note of this?
o   leave smooth off, get the gl object, then enable line smooth
X   don't bother, this is a workaround for another bug
o PPolygon no longer in use and PLine is a mess
o   make a version of PGraphics3 that uses it for more accurate rendering?

X   also fix for other libraries in the make scripts across platforms
X fix problems in PApplet regarding signed code
X   createInput() wasn't bothering to check files when not online
X unhint() has been removed, see the reference for hint() for changes
o enable() and disable() instead of hint()/unhint()
o   should these use text strings? how will that be compiled?
X remove unhint(), add opposite hints for those that need to be disabled
o   maybe update hint() ref to be more clear about screen not accumulating
X   no, it's explicitly stated as such
X make decisions about whether PGraphics is an abstract class or not
X   method signature is a real problem
X figure out how to handle constructor mess
X   clean up setMainDrawingSurface()
X   should instead be inside size(), and init(), no?
X add to hint(DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST)
X   gl.glClear(GL.GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
X   or clearing the zbuffer for P3D
X   also add a note to the hint() reference
X DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST bad results
X   have to clear the zbuffer to make it work
X   this may be specific to lines
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=827
X   though it also seems to be a problem with opengl
X   also make a note of disabling as a way to help font appearance
o Font width calculation fails when using vectorfonts and PDF
o   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=920
X um, this is gross: getMatrix((PMatrix2D) null)
X no changing point sizes when using beginShape(POINTS)
X   this is an opengl restriction, should we stick with it elsewhere?
X   and changing stroke weight in general (with lines/shapes)
o   no renderer does this, we should probably disable it
X   added a note to the reference about it
X may need to add to PApplet.main() for OS X 10.5
X   System.setProperty("apple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz", "true");
X deprecate arraycopy(), change to arrayCopy()

cleaning
o chooseFile() and chooseFolder() with named fxn callbacks
o   the function must take a File object as a parameter
o add better error messages for all built-in renderers
o   i.e. "import library -> pdf" when pdf is missing
o cameraXYZ doesn't seem to actually be used for anything
o   since camera functions don't even look at it or set it
o registerSize() in arcball is causing trouble
o   some sort of infinite loop issue
o textMode(SCREEN) is broken for opengl
o   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=426
o textSpace(SCREEN) for opengl and java2d
o   don't use loadPixels for either
o   use font code to set the cached color of the font, then call set()
o   although set() with alpha is a little different..
o resizing opengl applet likely to cause big trouble
o   componentlistener should prolly only do size() command outside of draw
o fjen says blend() doens't work in JAVA2D
o   the functions are fairly well separated now in PMethods
o   just go through all the stuff to make sure it's setting properly

point()
X java2d - if strokeWeight is 1, do screenX/Y and set()
X   if strokeWeight larger, should work ok with line()
X   no, use an ellipse if strokeWeight is larger
X gl points not working again
X   need to implement point() as actual gl points
X   this means adding points to the pipeline
X point() doesn't work with some graphics card setups
X   particularly with opengl and java2d
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=121
X point() issues
o   point() being funneled through beginShape is terribly slow
X     go the other way 'round
X   sometimes broken, could be a problem with java 1.5? (was using win2k)

font
X fix getFontMetrics() warning
X   need to have a getGraphics() to get the actual Graphics object
X   where drawing is happening. parent.getGraphics() works except for OpenGL
X Java2D textLinePlacedImpl should check for ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS hint
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=633
X also try to check native font on textFont() commands
X   in case the hint() has been enabled in the meantime
X   or rather, always load native font, even w/o the hint() being set

PGraphics API changes
X setMainDrawingSurface() -> setPrimarySurface()
X mainDrawingSurface = primarySurface;
X resize() -> setSize() (roughly)
X endShape() with no params is no longer 'final'
X X/Y/Z -> TX/TY/TZ
X MX/MY/MZ -> X/Y/Z (for sake of PShape)
X render_triangles -> renderTriangles()
X depth_sort_triangles -> sortTriangles()
X render_lines -> renderLines()
X depth_sort_lines -> sortLines()
X no longer any abstract methods in PGraphics itself
X removed support for specular alpha (and its 'SPA' constant)
X clear() -> backgroundImpl()
X add DIAMETER as synonym for CENTER for ellipseMode and friends
X textFontNative and textFontNativeMetrics have been removed
X   they've been re-implemented per-PGraphics in a less hacky way
X hint(ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS) goes away
X   need to mention in createFont() reference
X   also maybe cover in the loadFont() reference? (maybe problem...)
X image.cache has been removed, replaced with get/set/removeCache()
X   this allows per-renderer image cache data to be stored
X imageMode has been removed from PImage, too awkward
X   this also means that imageMode ignored for get(), set(), blend() and copy()
X smooth is now part of PGraphics, moved out of PImage
X raw must handle points, lines, triangles, and textures
X light position and normal are now PVector object
X changed NORMALIZED to NORMAL for textureMode()

shapes
X maybe finish off the svg crap for this release
X working on pshape
X   add shape() methods to PGraphics/PApplet
X   test and fix svg examples
X revisions.txt for x/y/z/ tx/ty/tz.. other changes in api.txt
X bring svg into main lib
X need to straighten out 'table' object for quick object lookup
X   maybe add to all parent tables? (no, this gets enormous quickly)
X fix svg caps/joins for opengl with svg library
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=628
X save/restore more of the p5 graphics drawing state
X   not setting colorMode(), strokeCap, etc.
X ignoreStyles is broken - how to handle
X   need a whole "styles" handler
X handle cap/join stuff by
X   if it's setting the default, no error message
X   if it's not the default, then show an error msg once
X   have a list Strings for errors called, rather than constants for all
X     that way, no need to have an error message for every friggin function
X PMatrix now PMatrix3D (maybe not yet?)
X change svg library reference

hint/unhint/enable/disable
X option to have renderer errors show up
X   1) as text warnings 2) as runtime exceptions 3) never
X add warning system for pgraphics, rather than runtime exceptions
X   keep array of warning strings, and booleans for whether they've called
X ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT not really working for GL
X   because the zbuffer is still there, it's still calculating
X   actually, this is probably because it happens after the frame
X   so really, flush is required whenever the depth sort is called
X   need to check this--isn't this referring to DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST?
X ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT causing trouble with MovieMaker
X   need to make the flush() api accessible
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=692
X image smoothing
X   straighten out default vs. ACCURATE vs. whatever
X   Java2D and P3D and OpenGL are all inconsistent
o   need to be able to do hint() to do nearest neighbor filtering

X   don't want to hose PGraphics for others
X   both for pdf, and making background transparent images
X PGraphics3D should alloc to all transparent
X   unless it's the main drawing surface (does it know on alloc?)
X   in which case it should be set to opaque
X have createGraphics() create a completely transparent image
X   and also not require defaults() to be called
X make a note in the createFont() reference that 1.5 on OS X has problems

X when using PGraphics, must call beginFrame() and endFrame()
X   also need to be able to turn off MemoryImageSource on endFrame
X   call defaults() in beginFrame()
X should PGraphics be a base class with implementations and variables?
X   then PGraphics2D and PGraphics3D that subclass it?
X   (or even just PGraphics2 and PGraphics3)

X fix bug that was causing font sizes not to be set on opengl
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=174
X apply fix from toxi to make targa files less picky
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1127999630
X "folder" has been renamed to "path" to match savePath().
X added "dataPath" to return the full path to something in the data folder
X savePath should maybe be appletPath or sketchPath
X   because can be used for opening files too
X   (i.e. if needing a File object)
X width, height set to zero in static mode
X   probably only set when resize() is called, and it's not happening
X g.smooth is always false in opengl
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=192

o triangleColors are different because they're per-triangle
o   as opposed to per-vertex, because it's based on the facet of the tri
X make vertexCount etc properly accessible in PGraphics3
X   so that people can do things like the dxf renderer
X also have a simple way to hook in triangle leeches to PGraphics3
X   this exists, but needs to be documented, or have accessors

X   http://192.18.37.44/forums/index.php?topic=1596.msg79680#msg79680
X faster blur code contributed by toxi
X filter(ERODE) and filter(DILATE) contributed by toxi
o textAscent() should probably be g.textAscent instead
o   more like textLeading() etc
X   nope, because it requires grabbing the font metrics and other calculations
X bezierDetail, curveDetail made public
X added textMode(SHAPE) for OPENGL
X error message saying that strokeCap and strokeJoin don't work in P3D
X textMode(SHAPE) throws ex when drawing and font not installed
X fix a bug with filename capitalization error throwing
X add NO_DEPTH_TEST to PGraphics3
X java 1.4 code snuck into PApplet, causing problems on the mac
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=146
X prevent PGraphics.save() from inserting a file prefix
X   so that people can use absolute paths
X   or add a version that takes a file object

nixed or fixed in previous releases
X textMode(SCREEN) having issues on Mac OS X
X   seem to be problems with updatePixels() on the mac
X   appears to run asynchronously

0092 core
X rle-compressed tga save() method added by toxi
X   also version that only saves RGB instead of ARGB
X proper/consistent api to access matrices in PGraphics/PGraphics3
X   first use loadMatrix(), then m00, m01 etc
X   find the post on the board and make a note of this
X proper api for access to Graphics2D object in PGraphics2
X   just add the current "g2" thing to the faq
X   and make a note of it on the suggestions board
X vars like cameraX etc need to be in PGraphics
X   otherwise g.xxxx won't work
X   how far should this go? vertices etc?
X   vertices not included because switching to triangleImpl and lineImpl
X fix for copy() in java2d to make things a little speedier
X make PApplet.main() for java 1.3 friendly (Color class constants)
X remove call to background() in PGraphics2
o change PGraphics to PGraphics2
o   or not, because PGraphics has all the base stuff for 3D
o   change PGraphics2 to PGraphicsJava or PGraphicsJava2D
o   maybe wait until the new shape stuff is done?
X move font placement stuff back into PGraphics?
X   figure out how to get regular + java fonts working
X   use that do drive how the api is set up
X optimize fonts by using native fonts in PGraphics2
X   especially textMode(SCREEN) which is disastrously slow
X   in java2d, can quickly blit the image itself
X   this way, can isolate it for gl too, which will use glBitmap
X   danger of this setup is that it may run much nicer for the author
X     i.e. with the font installed, and then super slow for their users
X add "smooth" as a field inside the font file
X   and when smooth field is set, make sure JAVA2D enables smoothing
X   since otherwise smooth() has to be called for the whole g2
X rob saunders contributed a fix for a bug in PImage.copy()
X   the wrong boundaries were being copied in the code
X fix bug where noLoop() was waiting 10 secs to call exit()

o make the 1.4 code in PApplet load via reflection
X   doesn't appear necessary with 1.3 applets
o   or is some of the stuff usable in 1.3 but not all?
o     ie. the device config classes exist but not the set full screen method
X currently some bugs in the main() because it's not sizing applets

cleared out / completed in previous releases
X typed version of expand() and contract()
o fishwick bug with text() and shapes
o   ellipses no longer completed when g.dimensions = 2 or 3,
o   or not even drawn.. what a mess.
X go through and figure out what stuff to make public
o depth testing of lines vs text is problematic
o   probably need to patch in an older version of the line code
o   use depth()/noDepth() to handle depth test
X on exceptions, use die to just kill the applet
X make the file i/o stuff work more cleanly
X   if people want to use their own file i/o they can do that too
o this could also be contributing to the hanging bug
X static applets need to be able to resize themselves on 'play'
X figure out what to do with static apps exported as application
X   needs to just hang there
o scripts (w/ no graphics) will need to call exit() explicitly
o   actually.. just override the default draw() to say exit()
X may need a fileOutput() and fileInput() function
X   to take care of exception handling
o or maybe scripts are just handled with a different method? (yech)
o   or maybe setup() can actually throw and Exception?
o   but that's inserted by the parser, and hidden from the user?
o implement size(0, 0) -> just doesn't bother doing a frame.show();
o   too abstract, just have draw() call exit by default
o   so if nothing inside draw, just quits
o   make properly exit after things are finished
o still some weirdness with thread flickering on the mac
o   and frenetic display updates on the pc
o move really general things out of PConstants (X, Y, Z..) ?
X add something to PApplet to have constants for the platform
o   needed for error messages (don't talk about winvdig on mac)
X   and also useful for programs
X bring screen space and font size settings back in to PGraphics
X   causing too much trouble to be stuck down in PFont

X camera(), perspective(), ortho()
X matrix set by the camera on each beginFrame
X push/pop are now pushMatrix/popMatrix
o get PGraphics.java engine working again

lighting stuff
X make fill() cover ambient and diffuse
X   provide separate call for ambient to shut it off
o why does diffuse just mirror fill()?
o   seems to cover just diffuse, not ambient_and_diffuse like fill
o   maybe fill() should set diffuse, and sep call to ambient() sets ambient?
X   removed it
X move dot() to the bottom w/ the other math

already done
X remove PMethods as actual class, use recordFrame(PGraphics)
X   size(200, 200, "processing.illustrator.PGraphicsAI");

api questions
o image(String name) and textFont(String name)
o   do we change to font(arial, 12) ?
X remove angleMode() ?
X be consistent about getXxx() methods
X   just use the variable names.. don't do overkill on fillR et al
X   or just what functions are actually made public
X   is fillRi needed? it's pretty goofy..
X how to handle full screen (opengl especially) or no screen (for scripts)

tweaking up simong light code
o what's up with resetLights?
o add PLight object to avoid method overflow
o preApplyMatrix, invApplyMatrix?
o   applyMatrixPre and applyMatrixIn

o   irotateX?, papplyMatrix?

wednesday evening

X   call it open()
X what to call firstMouse
X implement rightMouse?
X   yes, mouseButton = LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT
X error when running on 1.1...

X make inverseCamera into cameraInv
X fix messages referring to depth()
X   route all of them through a single function rather than current waste
X fix bezierVertex() in P3D for newer api

wednesday late
X track loadImage() with filenames that are inconsistent
X   really a problem with the ves61r kids
X   i.e. mixed case filename in sketch is different in windows
X   but when uploaded to a unix server causes a serious problem
X   use canonicalPath to flag possible problems
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1096508877;start=5
o fix shapes in P3D (line loop, polygons, etc)
o should we include a from and to for the directional light?
X   no, cuz it doesn't do much really..
X   fromX-toX etc is all that's different

thursday day
X set modelview to camera on endCamera
X add ortho() and perspective() to PGraphics.java

thursday evening
o textMode(ALIGN_LEFT) etc, should make sure that left/center/right not used
X   though since have to change to LEFT, should be easy to switch

friday night
o should toInt('5') return the ascii or the char?
X   since (int) '5' returns the ascii, that's what it does
X   made a note in the PApplet reference

text api
X textMode ALIGN_CENTER _LEFT _RIGHT -> CENTER, LEFT, RIGHT ?
X use built-in font if available? yes
o text() with \n is semi-broken
X does the font or PApplet control the size? (the font, ala java)
X without setting the font, SCREEN_SPACE comes out weird
o move SCREEN_SPACE into ScreenFont() class?
o   probably not, casey thinks screen space text is prolly more useful
o   that way can clear up some of the general confusion in the code
X textFont with a named font can use the renderer/os font
X   illustrator api can get the ps name from the java font name
X     since it's associated with the font file.. wee!
X   for postscript, can grab the real font
o   altho problem here is that really the fonts just need a name
o      since needs to render to screen as well
o      font has to be installed to get psname
X      fine because why would you embed a ps font that you don't have?
o need to resolve SCREEN_SPACE vs OBJECT_SPACE
o   can this be auto-detected with noDepth()?
o   how does rotated text work?
o     PFont.rotate(180) rotate(PI)
o     or can this be detected from the matrix?
X don't use pixels to do screen space text inside PFont
X   add a function in PGraphics for direct pixel image impl
X store the font name in the vlw font file (at the end)
o   could include multiple names for multi platforms
X get text impl stuff working properly
o look into fixing the texture mapping to not squash fonts
o   NEW_GRAPHICS totally smashes everything

friday postgame
X implement createFont()
X   with a .ttf does a create font internally (1.3+ only)
X     although the images aren't populated
X     until a P2D/P3D/OPENGL tries to draw them, which triggers it
X     but if PGraphics2, just uses the built-in font
X   also works for font names and just creating them
X     if font name doesn't end with otf or ttf, then tries to create it
X change objectX/Y/Z to modelX/Y/Z
X PFont.list() to return string list of all the available fonts
X   probably not a mode of use that we really want to encourage
X   actually important because the whole graphicsdevice crap is silly
X     and we need a 1.1 versus 1.3/1.4 version
X implement printarr() as println() ?
X   actually deal with all the array types.. oy
X should nf() handle commas as well?
X   just add a basic nfc() version for ints and floats
o   yes, and add nf(int what) so that non-padded version works
o   but don't put commas into the zero-padded version
o   make nf/nfs/nfp not so weird
o   nf(PLUS, ...) nf(PAD, ...) nfc(PLUS, ...)
X unhex was broken for numbers bigger than 2^31

saturday late afternoon
X fix bug with openStream() and upper/lowercase stuff
X   do a better job of handling any kind of URLs in openStream()

sunday morning
X incorporate simon's new lighting code


0082 core
X make jdkVersion, jdkVersionName, platform, platformName variables
X additional note about screen sizes and displays
X sto instead of stop in present mode
X appears that opengl libraries weren't correctly added in 81?
X requestFocus() now called on gl canvas
X basic lights now work by default


0081 core
X background(PImage) now works in opengl
X when running externally, applets don't always get placed properly
X   if size is never set, then doesn't always layout
X   problem is in gl and in core, and is inconsistent
X   move more logic for layout into PApplet.. maybe a static method?
X   this way can avoid duplicating / breaking things
o what is the stroked version of a sphere? a circle?
X write list of params that can be passed to PApplet
o document in the code a note about how size() et al place themselves
X saveFrame was double-adding the save path because of save() changes

size(200, 200, P3D) - createGraphics and placement issues
X make pappletgl work back inside papplet
X   and then size(300, 300, DEPTH) etc
X   get rid of opengl renderer menu
o   otherwise hint() to use the p5 renderer instead of java2d
X applet placement is screwy
X how to force PGraphics() instead of PGraphics2()
X   size(300, 200, P2D);
X size() doing a setBounds() is really bad
X   because it means things can't be embedded properly
o applets on osx (and windows) sometimes show up 20 pixels off the top
X how to shut off rendering to screen when illustrator in use?
X   need size(30000, 20000) for illustrator, problem in papplet
X   size(30000, 20000, ILLUSTRATOR)
X make Graphics2 et al load dynamically using reflection
X   can this be done with g2 and if exception just falls back to g1?
X   this way people can remove g1 by hand
o size() that changes renderer will throw nasty exception in draw()
X   or maybe that's ok? document that no changing renderers?
X take a look to see what needs to happen to get PAppletGL merged in
X   i.e. can i just extend GLCanvas?

present mode
o call present() from inside the code?
o   that if applet is 500x500, centers on a 800x600 window
X   no, that's nasty... use --present to launch in present window
X though how do you get the screen size?
X   screen.width and screen.height? - yes
X write java 1.4 code for full screen version of PApplet
X   this might be used for presentation mode
X proper full screen code for present mode
X   why do mouse motion events go away in full screen mode
X   or with a Window object
X use screen manager to run present mode properly
X   set both versions to require java 1.4
X   change the Info.plist inside macosx
X   and add something to PdeBase to make sure that it's in 1.4
X running present mode with a bug in the program hoses things
X   make sure the program compiles before starting present mode


0080 core
X PApplet.saveFrame() is saving to sketch folder, PApplet.save() is not
X   PApplet.save() will save to the applet folder,
X   but PImage.save() or PGraphics.save() will save only to the current
X   working directory, usually the Processing folder.
X removed static version of mask() from PImage
X   no more PImage.mask(theImage, maskImage)
X   just use theImage.mask(maskImage)
X PImage.filter()
X   maybe use quasimondo's gaussian blur code?
X     http://incubator.quasimondo.com/processing/gaussian_blur_1.php

X   no, in keeping with getting shit done
X   BLUR - write simple blur
X     how does photoshop handle this?
X   BLUR - add gaussian blur
X   email re: credit/attribution and descrepancy between algos
X forgot to mention the line hack to get points working in 78
X implemented PGraphicsGL.set(x, y, argb)
X implement PGraphicsGL.set(x, y, PImage)
X blend, copy, filter all implemented for opengl
X copy(Pimage, x, y) has become set(x, y, PImage)
X textMode -> textAlign
X   ALIGN_LEFT, ALIGN_CENTER, ALIGN_RIGHT -> LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT
X textSpace -> textMode
X   NORMAL_SPACE -> NORMALIZED, OBJECT_SPACE -> OBJECT
X text in a box is broken (at least for PGraphics2)
o   check to see if it's a rounding error with width()
o   get text rect working again (seems to be in infinite loop)
X   nope, was just that the space width wasn't being scaled up properly
X clean up the javadoc so no more errors
X change mbox to PFont.size?
o   make width() return values based on natural size?
X   not a great idea.. plus java2d uses 1 pixel font for things
X email simon re: lighting api
X   things are actually more on track than expected
X camera is swapping colors in gl (on mac?)
X   in fact, all textures on mac were swapping colors
X   test this on windows to see if fixed
X sphere x,y,z,r or box w,h,d.. need to make them consistent
X   goodbye sphere(x, y, z, r)
o should available() be waiting() or something like that instead?
o go through and see what functions (no pixel ops?) frame recorders should have
X   decided instead to use recordFrame(PGraphics)
o remove SCREEN_SPACE altogether?
X   can't do this for now

implemented in 79
X make sure arc goes in the right direction that we want it to
X   (make sure that PGraphics3 goes the same direction)

X saveFrame seems to be broken
X   fixed for PGraphics2
X   fixed for PGraphicsGL
X   also implemented loadPixels/updatePixels for gl

X alpha() colors are inverted (white is opaque.. doesn't make sense)
X   should we swap this around? no - this is how photoshop works
X fix arc
X get() is back
X set camera.modified so that it draws properly
X it's annoying not having a copy() function inside PImage
X   formerly get() with no params
o   clone throws an exception
o   PImage constructor that takes itself?
o   PImage copy = new PImage(another);
X got rid of CONCAVE_POLYGON and CONVEX_POLYGON
X hack for points to work in opengl, but still not working broadly
X work on filter() functions
X   POSTERIZE - find simple code that does it?
X     there must be a straightforward optimized version of it
o   EDGES - find edges in casey's example is differen than photoshop
o     which version do people want with their stuff
X     edges filter removed
X several fixes to Movie and Camera to work with the new gfx model
X PImage.get(x, y, w, h) had a bug when things went off the edge
X set defaults for strokeCap and strokeJoin
X get() and gl images were broken for screen sizes less than full size
X fix arcs, were badly broken between java2d and pgraphics
X look at curve functions more closely
X   should we switch to curveVertex(1,2,3) (ala curveto)
X   because some confusion with mixing types of curves
o   make sure we don't want curveVertices(1,2,3,u,v)
o   also make test cases so that java2d and java11 behave the same
X implement PGraphics2.curveVertex()
X updatePixels() not setting PApplet.pixels
X   make loadPixels in PGraphics ignored, and put it in PApplet
X made loadStrings() and openStream(File) static again
X test loadPixels()/updatePixels()/saveFrame() on the pc
X   better, just assume that they need the endian swap
X fixed draw mode apps for opengl
X   (gl was missing a beginFrame)
X pmouseX, pmouseY are not working in OpenGL mode
X   (as they are working in Processing mode)

o screenX/Y aren't properly working for 2D points against a 3D matrix
o   (ryan alexander rounding bug)
o   Just to clarify, it works completely correctly with rounding
o   screenX/Y and also using the 3 arg version of translate -
o   ie translate(hw,hh,0) instead of just translate(hw,hh).
X   no longer an issue because moving to 2D and 3D modes
o PImage: remove the static versions of manipulators?
o   probably not, because they're inherited by PApplet
o   i.e. mask(image, themask);
X   no PImage needed b/c PGraphics is a PImage
o colorMode(GRAY) to avoid stroke(0) causing trouble?
o   or maybe get rid of stroke(0)? hrm


0077 core
X bring back pmouseX/Y using a tricky method of storing separate
X   values for inside draw() versus inside the event handler versions
X   debug handling, and make firstMouse public
X explicitly state depth()/nodepth()
X   don't allocate zbuffer & stencil until depth() is called
X arc with stroke only draws the arc shape itself
X   may need a 'wedge' function to draw a stroke around the whole thing
X only allocate stencil and zbuffer on first call to depth()
X   this will require changes to PTriangle and PLine inside their loops
X try running javadoc
X die() may need to throw a RuntimeException
o call filter() to convert RGB/RGBA/ALPHA/GRAY
o   cuz the cache is gonna be bad going rgb to rgba
X   don't bother, people can re-create the image or set cache null
X fix font coloring in PGraphics2
X fix tint() for PGraphics2
X get text working again
X   partially the problem is with ALPHA images
X     how should they be stored internally
X   also colored text, requires tint() to work properly
X move textMode and textSpace back out of PFont
X   use die() to fail in font situations
X   can't, just use a RuntimeException

covered in previous
X before graphics engine change, attach jogl stuff
X   need to try jogl to make sure no further changes
X   and the illustrator stuff
o massive graphics engine changes
o   move to new graphics engine
o     test with rgb cube, shut off smoothing
o   make sure line artifacts are because of smoothing
o   implement 2x oversampling for anti-aliasing
o renderers can plug in:
o   at direct api level
o     taking over all color() functions and vertex collection
o   at endShape() level
o     where vertices are collected by core and blit on endShape()
o     (takes polygons and lines)
o   at post tesselation level
o     takes only line segments and triangles to blit (dxf writer)
o api for file-based renderers
o   need to work this out since it will affect other api changes
o   size(0, 0) and then ai.size(10000, 20000)
o     size 0 is code for internal to not show any window
o   saveFrame(PRenderer) or saveFrame("name", PRenderer)
o   saveFrame gets called at the beginning of loop()
o     or is just a message to save the next frame (problem for anim)
X vertices max out at 512.. make it grow
X add gzipInput and gzipOutput
X light(x, y, z, c1, c2, c3, TYPE)
X   also BLight with same constructor, and on() and off() fxn
X make sure applet is stopping in draw mode
X loadImage() is broken on some machines
X   hacked for a fix in 72, but need to better coordinate with openStream()

postscript
X pushing all intelligence down into class that implements PMethods
o keep hints about type of geometry used to reconstruct
o   no special class, just uses public vars from PGraphics
o how to hook into curve rendering so that curve segments are drawn
o   maybe lines are rendered and sorted,
o   but they point to an original version of the curve geometry
o   that can be re-rendered
o   also integrate catmull-rom -> bezier inverse matrices
o   even with the general catmull-rom, to render via ai beziers

api changes
X removed circle.. it's dumb when ellipse() is in there
X   (it's not like we have square() in the api)
X arcMode is gone.. just uses ellipseMode()
X save tga and tif methods are static and public
X imageMode(CORNER) and CORNERS are the only usable versions
X alpha(PImage) is now called mask() instead
X   already have an alpha() function that gets alpha bits
X on start, mouseX is 0.. how to avoid?
X   use firstMouse variable.. figure out naming
X get frame recording working
X   not tested, but at least it's there

image stuff
o could also do PImage2, which would need a getPixels() before messing w/ it
o   bad idea, distinction not clear
o even in java 1.1, could use regular java.awt.Image and require getPixels()
o   -> 1.1 wouldn't help anything, because needs pixels to render, oops
X the updatePixels() in PGraphics has to be overridden (from PImage)
X   to make itself actually update on-screen
X   actually, should be no different than the check_image function
X PGraphics2 and PGraphicsGL will need loadPixels() to be called
X   in order to read pixels from the buffer
X loadPixels() and updatePixels() prolly should be shut off in opengl
X   make people use get() instead to grab sub-images
X   PGraphicsGL.copy() needs to be overridden.. use glDrawBitmap
o loadImage() needs to handle 1.1 vs 1.3 loading
o   set image.format to be BUFFERED? no.. just use RGBA always
o have a flag to always use the cache, i.e. with BufferedImage
o   turn that off when someone modifies it (nope, no need to)
X PImage.getPixels(), updatePixels(), updatePixels(x, y, w, h),
o   PImage.setPixels(int another[]);
X imageMode(CENTER) is weird for copy() and updatePixels()
X   perhaps copy() and get() ignore imageMode and use xywh or x1y1x2y2?
X   or disallow imageMode(CENTER) altogether?
o in java 1.3, getPixels() can call getRGB() via reflection
o   cache.getClass().getName().equals("BufferedImage")
X readPixels/writePixels?
X   has to happen, since this is so fundamental to gl as well
X loadImage in 1.3 leaves pixels[] null (not in 1.1)
X   1.3 plus gl is a problem, since conflicting caches
X   gl has no need for a bufferedimage tho
X     so maybe checks to see if the cache is a BufferedImage
X     if it is, calls getPixels to set the int array
X     then replaces cache with glimageache
X     pappletgl loadimage could take care of this instead
X       calls super.loadImage(), if cache != null, proceed..
X       this is prolly a mess
X PImage.getPixels() and PImage.getPixels(x, y, w, h) ->
X   (the xywh version still allocates the entire array, but only updates those)
X   only needed for java2d
X   not (necessarily) needed when loading images,
X     but definitely needed when setting pixels on PGraphics
X PImage.updatePixels() and PImage.updatePixels(x, y, w, h)
X   (this is actually just setModified)
X   in opengl, marks all or some as modified
X     so next time it's drawn, the texture is updated PGraphicsGL.image()
X   in java2d, updates the BufferedImage on next draw
X can't use regular getPixels() on PGraphics, because its image isn't 'cache'
X   also, the cache may be used to draw the whole surface as a gl texture (?)
X   not a problem for the main PGraphics, but for any others created to draw on

opengl
X make light() functions actually do something in PGraphicsGL
X box() and sphere() working again
X make opengl work in draw mode
X   set initial size using --size=
X color channels seem to be swapped on windows in image example
X   check on the mac to see what it looks like

X default to single byte input from serial port
X   and add serial.setBuffer() for message length as alternative
X   or serial.setDelimiter() to fire message on delim
X     named it bufferUntil();


0076 core
X no changes, only launcher issues


0075
X textureMode(NORMAL_SPACE)  screws up the image() command
X   image() appears to require IMAGE_SPACE to function properly.
X added focusGained() and focusLost()
X lots of changes to internal naming of vars
X screenX(x, y) and screenY(x, y) added for noDepth()
X add TRIANGLE_FAN
X eyeX, eyeY etc have been renamed cameraX/Y/Z, and cameraNear/Far
X modify targa and tiff writing routines to break into header writing
X   writeTIFF, writeHeaderTIFF, writeTGA, writeHeaderTGA
X MAJOR CHANGE: RGBA becomes ARGB for accuracy
o uv coords > 1 shouldn't clamp, they should just repeat ala opengl
o   actually i think opengl has a setting for it
o remove need to use depth() at the beginning
X   need only be set once
X pmouseX is broken again
X   remove pmouseX/Y altogether
X   maintain things a bit different
o   email the beta@ list to see how people are using pmouseX
X changed PMovie.length to PMovie.duration
X move around/simplify loadImage() inside PApplet
X working to add more die() statements inside PApplet
o can ALPHA fonts work using the other replace modes?

fixed in previous releases
X text stuff
X   text() with alignment doesn't work for multiple lines
X   don't change the size of a font when in screen space mode
X   patch rotated text (from visualclusto) into bfont
X   what sort of api? textSpace(ROTATED) ?
X   rotated text has a bug for when it goes offscreen

opengl
X why is the thing hanging until 'stop' is hit?
X   what happens when stop is hit that sets it free?
X   (at what point does it start working properly?)
X cache needs to also make things a power of 2
X   if images are already a power of 2, then needn't re-alloc
X cacheIndex needs to be set to -1 when the image is modified
X   or maybe have a modified() function?
X debug why certain spots are having errors (see 'problem here' notes)
X   INVALID_OPERATION after drawing lines for cube
X fix noLoop bug
X remove errors when drawing textures
X reverse y coordinates
X make play button un-highlight with opengl
X   also make window move messages work properly
X   very necessary, since opens window at 100x100
X   problem was the threading issues
X bring back renderer menu
X   reading/saving pref for opengl renderer
X remove cameraMode(PERSPECTIVE) on each frame
X   why is the first one failing?
X still threading issues with running opengl
X   threading really horks up dual processor machine..
X   first run hangs until quit
X   though doesn't seem to replicate when p5 is restarted
X make sure background() gets called at least once with opengl
X   otherwise screen never actually updates
X beginFrame() around setup()
X   draw mode stuff happens inside setup..
o   or maybe need to get better at size() inside of draw() ?
X   make this consistent with the regular PApplet
X     otherwise things are going to be weird/difficult for debugging


0074 core
X removed zbuffer precision hack in PLine to improve z ordering

X make cursor() commands public
X ltext and rtext for screen space stuff
X ltext is broken when it goes y < 0 or y > height
X ltext & rtext completely working
X make sure font creator is making fonts properly fixed width
X   probably not using java charwidth for the char's width
X   probably wasn't using textFont() properly
X now that it's actually a key, should it be a char? (what's keyChar?)
X   that way println(c) would work a little better..
X libraryCalls() not properly working for pre, post, or draw()
o image(myg, x, y) doesn't work but image(myg, x, y, w, h) does
o   (image kind prolly not set right and so image() gets pissy)
o   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1091798655

text fixes
X make text rect use rectMode for placement
X if a word (no spaces) is too long to fit, insert a 'space'
X move left/center/right aligning into the font class
X   otherwise text with alignment has problems with returns
X could PFont2 be done entirely with reflection?
X   that way other font types can properly extend PFont
o font char widths from orator were not fixed width
o   may just need to regenerate. if not, widths may be set wrong.


0070 core
o check ordering of split() in java vs perl for regexp
X don't include empty chars in font builder

X api to properly sense when applet has focus
X   add a 'focused' variable to the applet
X   code now in zipdecode, maybe just list this as a standard thing?
X do applets know when they're stopped? stop? dispose?
X   would be good to set a param in p5 so that the thread dies
X   if people have other threads they've spawned, impossible to stop

cleaning up
X make bagel more usable as standalone
X   breakout BGraphics (have its own BImage)
o   breakout BApplet into BComponent ? (fix out-of-bounds mouse - doesn't)

X decide on whether to use PTools
X   decided against, since it doesn't help anything
X   and some functions need the applet object, so it's just annoying
o   i.e. move math functions into utility library
o   check what other functions require PGraphics to exist but shouldn't
o   look at BGraphics to see if setting an 'applet' could be used
o     then other than that, if no applet set, no connection to PApplet

040716
X change font api to not use leading() as a way to reset the leading
