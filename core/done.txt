X properly swap alpha values when lines need to be rendered backwards
X make cursor() commands public
X ltext and rtext for screen space stuff
X ltext is broken when it goes y < 0 or y > height
X ltext & rtext completely working
X make sure font creator is making fonts properly fixed width
X   probably not using java charwidth for the char's width
X   probably wasn't using textFont() properly
X now that it's actually a key, should it be a char? (what's keyChar?)
X   that way println(c) would work a little better..
X libraryCalls() not properly working for pre, post, or draw()
o image(myg, x, y) doesn't work but image(myg, x, y, w, h) does
o   (image kind prolly not set right and so image() gets pissy)
o   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1091798655

text fixes
X make text rect use rectMode for placement
X if a word (no spaces) is too long to fit, insert a 'space'
X move left/center/right aligning into the font class
X   otherwise text with alignment has problems with returns
X could PFont2 be done entirely with reflection?
X   that way other font types can properly extend PFont
o font char widths from orator were not fixed width
o   may just need to regenerate. if not, widths may be set wrong.

X   should it be called lerp or mix?
X acos, asin, atan, log, exp, ceil/floor, pow, mag(x,y,z)
X color issues
X   doesn't work when outside a function:
X     color bg_color = color(255,0,0);

X fixes to line and curve code
X api to properly sense when applet has focus
X   add a 'focused' variable to the applet
X   code now in zipdecode, maybe just list this as a standard thing?
X do applets know when they're stopped? stop? dispose?
X   would be good to set a param in p5 so that the thread dies
X   if people have other threads they've spawned, impossible to stop

cleaning up
X make bagel more usable as standalone
X   breakout BGraphics (have its own BImage)
o   breakout BApplet into BComponent ? (fix out-of-bounds mouse - doesn't)
o opengl export / rendering mode
o   currently implemented, but somewhat broken
o   finish this once all the line code is done

X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081706752;start=0
X decide on whether to use PTools
X   decided against, since it doesn't help anything
X   and some functions need the applet object, so it's just annoying
o   i.e. move math functions into utility library
o   check what other functions require PGraphics to exist but shouldn't
o   look at BGraphics to see if setting an 'applet' could be used
o     then other than that, if no applet set, no connection to PApplet

040716
X change font api to not use leading() as a way to reset the leading
X   resetLeading and resetSize are the things

X   casey: i wan't able to get binary() to work at all:
o Typography: Helix won't compile 
o   works fine, just needs BFont -> PFont
X standalone 'alpha' function for PImage (static methods for alpha fxns)
X Image: Edge, Image: Blur: Alpha not set? The error is easier to see on Blur
X   turns out bounds checking wasn't working properly on colors

X   print() commands in BApplet were among these
X die() command to exit an application or just stall out an applet
X   die(String error) and die(String error, Exception e) 
X more documentation in comments for functions
X chop() function that properly also handles nbsp
X join() was handled weird
X run nf() and nfs() on arrays
X nfp() to show plus sign
X toInt, toFloat, toDouble (nf is for toString.. inconsistent)
o split() function splits strings instead of splitStrings()
o   ints() converts an array of strings/doubles/floats to an int array

X   fixed it, also modified behavior of split() with a delimeter
X   previously, it would remove the final delimeter and an empty entry
X   but that's now disabled, since the split cmd is very specific
