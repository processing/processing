X "folder" has been renamed to "path" to match savePath().
X added "dataPath" to return the full path to something in the data folder
X savePath should maybe be appletPath or sketchPath
X   because can be used for opening files too 
X   (i.e. if needing a File object)

X move font placement stuff back into PGraphics?
X   figure out how to get regular + java fonts working
X   use that do drive how the api is set up
X optimize fonts by using native fonts in PGraphics2
X   especially textMode(SCREEN) which is disastrously slow
X   in java2d, can quickly blit the image itself
X   this way, can isolate it for gl too, which will use glBitmap
X   danger of this setup is that it may run much nicer for the author
X     i.e. with the font installed, and then super slow for their users
X add "smooth" as a field inside the font file
X   and when smooth field is set, make sure JAVA2D enables smoothing
X   since otherwise smooth() has to be called for the whole g2

X on exceptions, use die to just kill the applet
X make the file i/o stuff work more cleanly
X   if people want to use their own file i/o they can do that too

X static applets need to be able to resize themselves on 'play'
X figure out what to do with static apps exported as application
X   needs to just hang there
o scripts (w/ no graphics) will need to call exit() explicitly
o   actually.. just override the default draw() to say exit()
X may need a fileOutput() and fileInput() function
X   to take care of exception handling
o or maybe scripts are just handled with a different method? (yech)
o   or maybe setup() can actually throw and Exception?
o   but that's inserted by the parser, and hidden from the user?
o implement size(0, 0) -> just doesn't bother doing a frame.show();
o   too abstract, just have draw() call exit by default
o   so if nothing inside draw, just quits
o   make properly exit after things are finished
o still some weirdness with thread flickering on the mac
o   and frenetic display updates on the pc
o move really general things out of PConstants (X, Y, Z..) ?

o why does diffuse just mirror fill()?
o   seems to cover just diffuse, not ambient_and_diffuse like fill
o   maybe fill() should set diffuse, and sep call to ambient() sets ambient?

already done
X remove PMethods as actual class, use recordFrame(PGraphics)
X   size(200, 200, "processing.illustrator.PGraphicsAI");

X   fromX-toX etc is all that's different

thursday day
X set modelview to camera on endCamera
X add ortho() and perspective() to PGraphics.java

thursday evening
o textMode(ALIGN_LEFT) etc, should make sure that left/center/right not used
X   though since have to change to LEFT, should be easy to switch

friday night
o should toInt('5') return the ascii or the char? 
X   since (int) '5' returns the ascii, that's what it does
X   made a note in the PApplet reference

text api
X textMode ALIGN_CENTER _LEFT _RIGHT -> CENTER, LEFT, RIGHT ? 
X use built-in font if available? yes
o text() with \n is semi-broken
X does the font or PApplet control the size? (the font, ala java)
X without setting the font, SCREEN_SPACE comes out weird
o move SCREEN_SPACE into ScreenFont() class?
o   probably not, casey thinks screen space text is prolly more useful
o   that way can clear up some of the general confusion in the code
X textFont with a named font can use the renderer/os font
X   illustrator api can get the ps name from the java font name
X     since it's associated with the font file.. wee!
X   for postscript, can grab the real font
o   altho problem here is that really the fonts just need a name
o      since needs to render to screen as well
o      font has to be installed to get psname
X      fine because why would you embed a ps font that you don't have?
o need to resolve SCREEN_SPACE vs OBJECT_SPACE
o   can this be auto-detected with noDepth()? 
o   how does rotated text work?
o     PFont.rotate(180) rotate(PI)
o     or can this be detected from the matrix?
X don't use pixels to do screen space text inside PFont
X   add a function in PGraphics for direct pixel image impl 
X store the font name in the vlw font file (at the end)
o   could include multiple names for multi platforms
X get text impl stuff working properly
o look into fixing the texture mapping to not squash fonts
o   NEW_GRAPHICS totally smashes everything

friday postgame
X implement createFont()
X   with a .ttf does a create font internally (1.3+ only)
X     although the images aren't populated 
X     until a P2D/P3D/OPENGL tries to draw them, which triggers it
X     but if PGraphics2, just uses the built-in font
X   also works for font names and just creating them
X     if font name doesn't end with otf or ttf, then tries to create it
X change objectX/Y/Z to modelX/Y/Z
X PFont.list() to return string list of all the available fonts
X   probably not a mode of use that we really want to encourage
X   actually important because the whole graphicsdevice crap is silly
X     and we need a 1.1 versus 1.3/1.4 version
X implement printarr() as println() ?
X   actually deal with all the array types.. oy
X should nf() handle commas as well?
X   just add a basic nfc() version for ints and floats
o   yes, and add nf(int what) so that non-padded version works
o   but don't put commas into the zero-padded version
o   make nf/nfs/nfp not so weird
o   nf(PLUS, ...) nf(PAD, ...) nfc(PLUS, ...)
X unhex was broken for numbers bigger than 2^31

X appears that opengl libraries weren't correctly added in 81?
X requestFocus() now called on gl canvas
X basic lights now work by default


0081 core
X background(PImage) now works in opengl
X when running externally, applets don't always get placed properly
X   if size is never set, then doesn't always layout
X   problem is in gl and in core, and is inconsistent
X   move more logic for layout into PApplet.. maybe a static method?
X   this way can avoid duplicating / breaking things
o what is the stroked version of a sphere? a circle?
X write list of params that can be passed to PApplet
o document in the code a note about how size() et al place themselves
X saveFrame was double-adding the save path because of save() changes

size(200, 200, P3D) - createGraphics and placement issues

o   otherwise hint() to use the p5 renderer instead of java2d
X applet placement is screwy
X how to force PGraphics() instead of PGraphics2()
X   size(300, 200, P2D);
X size() doing a setBounds() is really bad
X   because it means things can't be embedded properly
o applets on osx (and windows) sometimes show up 20 pixels off the top 
X how to shut off rendering to screen when illustrator in use? 
X   need size(30000, 20000) for illustrator, problem in papplet
X   size(30000, 20000, ILLUSTRATOR)
X make Graphics2 et al load dynamically using reflection
X   can this be done with g2 and if exception just falls back to g1?
X   this way people can remove g1 by hand
o size() that changes renderer will throw nasty exception in draw()
X   or maybe that's ok? document that no changing renderers?
X take a look to see what needs to happen to get PAppletGL merged in
X   i.e. can i just extend GLCanvas?

present mode
o call present() from inside the code?
o   that if applet is 500x500, centers on a 800x600 window
X   no, that's nasty... use --present to launch in present window
X though how do you get the screen size? 
X   screen.width and screen.height? - yes
X write java 1.4 code for full screen version of PApplet
X   this might be used for presentation mode
X proper full screen code for present mode
X   why do mouse motion events go away in full screen mode
X   or with a Window object
X use screen manager to run present mode properly
X   set both versions to require java 1.4
X   change the Info.plist inside macosx
X   and add something to PdeBase to make sure that it's in 1.4
X running present mode with a bug in the program hoses things
X   make sure the program compiles before starting present mode

X clean up the javadoc so no more errors
X change mbox to PFont.size?

X   test this on windows to see if fixed
X sphere x,y,z,r or box w,h,d.. need to make them consistent
X   goodbye sphere(x, y, z, r)
o should available() be waiting() or something like that instead?
o go through and see what functions (no pixel ops?) frame recorders should have
X   decided instead to use recordFrame(PGraphics)
o remove SCREEN_SPACE altogether? 
X   can't do this for now

o   EDGES - find edges in casey's example is differen than photoshop
o     which version do people want with their stuff
X     edges filter removed
X several fixes to Movie and Camera to work with the new gfx model
X PImage.get(x, y, w, h) had a bug when things went off the edge
X set defaults for strokeCap and strokeJoin
X get() and gl images were broken for screen sizes less than full size
X fix arcs, were badly broken between java2d and pgraphics
X look at curve functions more closely
X   should we switch to curveVertex(1,2,3) (ala curveto)
X   because some confusion with mixing types of curves
o   make sure we don't want curveVertices(1,2,3,u,v)
o   also make test cases so that java2d and java11 behave the same
X implement PGraphics2.curveVertex()
X updatePixels() not setting PApplet.pixels
X   make loadPixels in PGraphics ignored, and put it in PApplet
X made loadStrings() and openStream(File) static again
X test loadPixels()/updatePixels()/saveFrame() on the pc
X   better, just assume that they need the endian swap
X fixed draw mode apps for opengl
X   (gl was missing a beginFrame)
X pmouseX, pmouseY are not working in OpenGL mode
X   (as they are working in Processing mode)

o screenX/Y aren't properly working for 2D points against a 3D matrix
o   (ryan alexander rounding bug)
o   Just to clarify, it works completely correctly with rounding
o   screenX/Y and also using the 3 arg version of translate - 
o   ie translate(hw,hh,0) instead of just translate(hw,hh). 
X   no longer an issue because moving to 2D and 3D modes
o PImage: remove the static versions of manipulators?
o   probably not, because they're inherited by PApplet
o   i.e. mask(image, themask); 
X   no PImage needed b/c PGraphics is a PImage
o colorMode(GRAY) to avoid stroke(0) causing trouble? 
o   or maybe get rid of stroke(0)? hrm


0077 core
X bring back pmouseX/Y using a tricky method of storing separate
X   values for inside draw() versus inside the event handler versions
X   debug handling, and make firstMouse public
X explicitly state depth()/nodepth()
X   don't allocate zbuffer & stencil until depth() is called
X arc with stroke only draws the arc shape itself
X   may need a 'wedge' function to draw a stroke around the whole thing
X only allocate stencil and zbuffer on first call to depth()
X   this will require changes to PTriangle and PLine inside their loops
X try running javadoc
X die() may need to throw a RuntimeException
o call filter() to convert RGB/RGBA/ALPHA/GRAY
o   cuz the cache is gonna be bad going rgb to rgba
X   don't bother, people can re-create the image or set cache null
X fix font coloring in PGraphics2
X fix tint() for PGraphics2
X get text working again
X   partially the problem is with ALPHA images
X     how should they be stored internally
X   also colored text, requires tint() to work properly
X move textMode and textSpace back out of PFont
X   use die() to fail in font situations
X   can't, just use a RuntimeException

covered in previous
X before graphics engine change, attach jogl stuff
X   need to try jogl to make sure no further changes
X   and the illustrator stuff
o massive graphics engine changes
o   move to new graphics engine
o     test with rgb cube, shut off smoothing
o   make sure line artifacts are because of smoothing
o   implement 2x oversampling for anti-aliasing
o renderers can plug in:
o   at direct api level
o     taking over all color() functions and vertex collection
o   at endShape() level
o     where vertices are collected by core and blit on endShape()
o     (takes polygons and lines)
o   at post tesselation level
o     takes only line segments and triangles to blit (dxf writer)
o api for file-based renderers
o   need to work this out since it will affect other api changes
o   size(0, 0) and then ai.size(10000, 20000)
o     size 0 is code for internal to not show any window
o   saveFrame(PRenderer) or saveFrame("name", PRenderer)
o   saveFrame gets called at the beginning of loop()
o     or is just a message to save the next frame (problem for anim)
X vertices max out at 512.. make it grow
X add gzipInput and gzipOutput
X light(x, y, z, c1, c2, c3, TYPE)
X   also BLight with same constructor, and on() and off() fxn
X make sure applet is stopping in draw mode
X loadImage() is broken on some machines
X   hacked for a fix in 72, but need to better coordinate with openStream()

postscript
X pushing all intelligence down into class that implements PMethods
o keep hints about type of geometry used to reconstruct
o   no special class, just uses public vars from PGraphics
o how to hook into curve rendering so that curve segments are drawn
o   maybe lines are rendered and sorted, 
o   but they point to an original version of the curve geometry 
o   that can be re-rendered 
o   also integrate catmull-rom -> bezier inverse matrices
o   even with the general catmull-rom, to render via ai beziers

api changes
X removed circle.. it's dumb when ellipse() is in there
X   (it's not like we have square() in the api)
X arcMode is gone.. just uses ellipseMode()
X save tga and tif methods are static and public
X imageMode(CORNER) and CORNERS are the only usable versions
X alpha(PImage) is now called mask() instead
X   already have an alpha() function that gets alpha bits
X on start, mouseX is 0.. how to avoid?
X   use firstMouse variable.. figure out naming
X get frame recording working
X   not tested, but at least it's there

image stuff
o could also do PImage2, which would need a getPixels() before messing w/ it
o   bad idea, distinction not clear
o even in java 1.1, could use regular java.awt.Image and require getPixels()
o   -> 1.1 wouldn't help anything, because needs pixels to render, oops
X the updatePixels() in PGraphics has to be overridden (from PImage)
X   to make itself actually update on-screen
X   actually, should be no different than the check_image function
X PGraphics2 and PGraphicsGL will need loadPixels() to be called
X   in order to read pixels from the buffer
X loadPixels() and updatePixels() prolly should be shut off in opengl
X   make people use get() instead to grab sub-images
X   PGraphicsGL.copy() needs to be overridden.. use glDrawBitmap
o loadImage() needs to handle 1.1 vs 1.3 loading
o   set image.format to be BUFFERED? no.. just use RGBA always
o have a flag to always use the cache, i.e. with BufferedImage
o   turn that off when someone modifies it (nope, no need to)
X PImage.getPixels(), updatePixels(), updatePixels(x, y, w, h), 
o   PImage.setPixels(int another[]);
X imageMode(CENTER) is weird for copy() and updatePixels()
X   perhaps copy() and get() ignore imageMode and use xywh or x1y1x2y2?
X   or disallow imageMode(CENTER) altogether?
o in java 1.3, getPixels() can call getRGB() via reflection
o   cache.getClass().getName().equals("BufferedImage")
X readPixels/writePixels?
X   has to happen, since this is so fundamental to gl as well
X loadImage in 1.3 leaves pixels[] null (not in 1.1)
X   1.3 plus gl is a problem, since conflicting caches
X   gl has no need for a bufferedimage tho
X     so maybe checks to see if the cache is a BufferedImage
X     if it is, calls getPixels to set the int array
X     then replaces cache with glimageache
X     pappletgl loadimage could take care of this instead
X       calls super.loadImage(), if cache != null, proceed..
X       this is prolly a mess
X PImage.getPixels() and PImage.getPixels(x, y, w, h) ->
X   (the xywh version still allocates the entire array, but only updates those)
X   only needed for java2d
X   not (necessarily) needed when loading images,
X     but definitely needed when setting pixels on PGraphics
X PImage.updatePixels() and PImage.updatePixels(x, y, w, h)
X   (this is actually just setModified)
X   in opengl, marks all or some as modified
X     so next time it's drawn, the texture is updated PGraphicsGL.image()
X   in java2d, updates the BufferedImage on next draw
X can't use regular getPixels() on PGraphics, because its image isn't 'cache'
X   also, the cache may be used to draw the whole surface as a gl texture (?)
X   not a problem for the main PGraphics, but for any others created to draw on

opengl
X make light() functions actually do something in PGraphicsGL
X box() and sphere() working again
X make opengl work in draw mode
X   set initial size using --size=
X color channels seem to be swapped on windows in image example
X   check on the mac to see what it looks like

X default to single byte input from serial port
X   and add serial.setBuffer() for message length as alternative
X   or serial.setDelimiter() to fire message on delim
X     named it bufferUntil();


0076 core
X no changes, only launcher issues


0075
X textureMode(NORMAL_SPACE)  screws up the image() command
X   image() appears to require IMAGE_SPACE to function properly. 
X added focusGained() and focusLost()
X lots of changes to internal naming of vars
X screenX(x, y) and screenY(x, y) added for noDepth()
X add TRIANGLE_FAN
X eyeX, eyeY etc have been renamed cameraX/Y/Z, and cameraNear/Far
X modify targa and tiff writing routines to break into header writing
X   writeTIFF, writeHeaderTIFF, writeTGA, writeHeaderTGA
X MAJOR CHANGE: RGBA becomes ARGB for accuracy
o uv coords > 1 shouldn't clamp, they should just repeat ala opengl
o   actually i think opengl has a setting for it
o remove need to use depth() at the beginning
X   need only be set once
X pmouseX is broken again
X   remove pmouseX/Y altogether
X   maintain things a bit different
o   email the beta@ list to see how people are using pmouseX
X changed PMovie.length to PMovie.duration
X move around/simplify loadImage() inside PApplet 
X working to add more die() statements inside PApplet
o can ALPHA fonts work using the other replace modes?

fixed in previous releases
X text stuff
X   text() with alignment doesn't work for multiple lines
X   don't change the size of a font when in screen space mode
X   patch rotated text (from visualclusto) into bfont
X   what sort of api? textSpace(ROTATED) ?
X   rotated text has a bug for when it goes offscreen

opengl
X why is the thing hanging until 'stop' is hit?
X   what happens when stop is hit that sets it free?
X   (at what point does it start working properly?)
X cache needs to also make things a power of 2
X   if images are already a power of 2, then needn't re-alloc
X cacheIndex needs to be set to -1 when the image is modified
X   or maybe have a modified() function?
X debug why certain spots are having errors (see 'problem here' notes)
X   INVALID_OPERATION after drawing lines for cube
X fix noLoop bug
X remove errors when drawing textures
X reverse y coordinates
X make play button un-highlight with opengl
X   also make window move messages work properly
X   very necessary, since opens window at 100x100
X   problem was the threading issues
X bring back renderer menu
X   reading/saving pref for opengl renderer
X remove cameraMode(PERSPECTIVE) on each frame
X   why is the first one failing?
X still threading issues with running opengl 
X   threading really horks up dual processor machine.. 
X   first run hangs until quit 
X   though doesn't seem to replicate when p5 is restarted
X make sure background() gets called at least once with opengl
X   otherwise screen never actually updates
X beginFrame() around setup()
X   draw mode stuff happens inside setup.. 
o   or maybe need to get better at size() inside of draw() ? 
X   make this consistent with the regular PApplet
X     otherwise things are going to be weird/difficult for debugging

X ltext & rtext completely working
X make sure font creator is making fonts properly fixed width
X   probably not using java charwidth for the char's width
X   probably wasn't using textFont() properly
X now that it's actually a key, should it be a char? (what's keyChar?)
X   that way println(c) would work a little better..
X libraryCalls() not properly working for pre, post, or draw()
o image(myg, x, y) doesn't work but image(myg, x, y, w, h) does
o   (image kind prolly not set right and so image() gets pissy)
o   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1091798655

text fixes
X make text rect use rectMode for placement
X if a word (no spaces) is too long to fit, insert a 'space'
X move left/center/right aligning into the font class
X   otherwise text with alignment has problems with returns
X could PFont2 be done entirely with reflection?
X   that way other font types can properly extend PFont
o font char widths from orator were not fixed width
o   may just need to regenerate. if not, widths may be set wrong.
