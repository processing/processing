cleaning
o chooseFile() and chooseFolder() with named fxn callbacks
o   the function must take a File object as a parameter
o add better error messages for all built-in renderers
o   i.e. "import library -> pdf" when pdf is missing
o cameraXYZ doesn't seem to actually be used for anything

o registerSize() in arcball is causing trouble
o   some sort of infinite loop issue
o textMode(SCREEN) is broken for opengl
o   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=426
o textSpace(SCREEN) for opengl and java2d
o   don't use loadPixels for either
o   use font code to set the cached color of the font, then call set()
o   although set() with alpha is a little different..
o resizing opengl applet likely to cause big trouble
o   componentlistener should prolly only do size() command outside of draw
o fjen says blend() doens't work in JAVA2D
o   the functions are fairly well separated now in PMethods
o   just go through all the stuff to make sure it's setting properly

point()
X java2d - if strokeWeight is 1, do screenX/Y and set()
X   if strokeWeight larger, should work ok with line()
X   no, use an ellipse if strokeWeight is larger
X gl points not working again
X   need to implement point() as actual gl points
X   this means adding points to the pipeline
X point() doesn't work with some graphics card setups
X   particularly with opengl and java2d
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=121
X point() issues
o   point() being funneled through beginShape is terribly slow
X     go the other way 'round
X   sometimes broken, could be a problem with java 1.5? (was using win2k)

font
X fix getFontMetrics() warning
X   need to have a getGraphics() to get the actual Graphics object
X   where drawing is happening. parent.getGraphics() works except for OpenGL
X Java2D textLinePlacedImpl should check for ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS hint
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=633
X also try to check native font on textFont() commands
X   in case the hint() has been enabled in the meantime
X   or rather, always load native font, even w/o the hint() being set

PGraphics API changes
X setMainDrawingSurface() -> setPrimarySurface()
X mainDrawingSurface = primarySurface;
X resize() -> setSize() (roughly)
X endShape() with no params is no longer 'final'
X X/Y/Z -> TX/TY/TZ
X MX/MY/MZ -> X/Y/Z (for sake of PShape)

X depth_sort_lines -> sortLines()
X no longer any abstract methods in PGraphics itself
X removed support for specular alpha (and its 'SPA' constant)
X clear() -> backgroundImpl()
X add DIAMETER as synonym for CENTER for ellipseMode and friends
X textFontNative and textFontNativeMetrics have been removed
X   they've been re-implemented per-PGraphics in a less hacky way
X hint(ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS) goes away
X   need to mention in createFont() reference
X   also maybe cover in the loadFont() reference? (maybe problem...)
X image.cache has been removed, replaced with get/set/removeCache()
X   this allows per-renderer image cache data to be stored
X imageMode has been removed from PImage, too awkward
X   this also means that imageMode ignored for get(), set(), blend() and copy()
X smooth is now part of PGraphics, moved out of PImage
X raw must handle points, lines, triangles, and textures
X light position and normal are now PVector object
X changed NORMALIZED to NORMAL for textureMode()

X   need a whole "styles" handler
X handle cap/join stuff by
X   if it's setting the default, no error message
X   if it's not the default, then show an error msg once
X   have a list Strings for errors called, rather than constants for all
X     that way, no need to have an error message for every friggin function
X PMatrix now PMatrix3D (maybe not yet?)
X change svg library reference

hint/unhint/enable/disable
X option to have renderer errors show up
X   1) as text warnings 2) as runtime exceptions 3) never
X add warning system for pgraphics, rather than runtime exceptions
X   keep array of warning strings, and booleans for whether they've called
X ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT not really working for GL
X   because the zbuffer is still there, it's still calculating
X   actually, this is probably because it happens after the frame
X   so really, flush is required whenever the depth sort is called
X   need to check this--isn't this referring to DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST?
X ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT causing trouble with MovieMaker
X   need to make the flush() api accessible

o   with loadBytes(), they can use gzipInput (or loadBytesGZ?)
o   although what does openStream do? (doesn't do auto?)
X   auto-gunzip on createReader()

o   do we change to font(arial, 12) ?
X remove angleMode() ?
X be consistent about getXxx() methods
X   just use the variable names.. don't do overkill on fillR et al
X   or just what functions are actually made public
X   is fillRi needed? it's pretty goofy..
X how to handle full screen (opengl especially) or no screen (for scripts)

tweaking up simong light code
o what's up with resetLights?
o add PLight object to avoid method overflow
o preApplyMatrix, invApplyMatrix? 
o   applyMatrixPre and applyMatrixIn
o   rotateXInv is ugly.. 
o   irotateX?, papplyMatrix?

wednesday evening
X expose api to launch files, folders, URLs
X   use with/in place of link()
X   call it open()
X what to call firstMouse
X implement rightMouse?
X   yes, mouseButton = LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT
X error when running on 1.1... 
X   You need to install Java 1.3 or later to view this content.
X   Click here to visit java.com and install.
X make inverseCamera into cameraInv
X fix messages referring to depth()
X   route all of them through a single function rather than current waste
X fix bezierVertex() in P3D for newer api

wednesday late
X track loadImage() with filenames that are inconsistent
X   really a problem with the ves61r kids
X   i.e. mixed case filename in sketch is different in windows
X   but when uploaded to a unix server causes a serious problem
X   use canonicalPath to flag possible problems
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1096508877;start=5
o fix shapes in P3D (line loop, polygons, etc)
o should we include a from and to for the directional light?
X   no, cuz it doesn't do much really.. 
X   fromX-toX etc is all that's different

thursday day
X set modelview to camera on endCamera
X add ortho() and perspective() to PGraphics.java

thursday evening
o textMode(ALIGN_LEFT) etc, should make sure that left/center/right not used
X   though since have to change to LEFT, should be easy to switch

friday night
o should toInt('5') return the ascii or the char? 
X   since (int) '5' returns the ascii, that's what it does
X   made a note in the PApplet reference

text api
X textMode ALIGN_CENTER _LEFT _RIGHT -> CENTER, LEFT, RIGHT ? 
X use built-in font if available? yes
o text() with \n is semi-broken
X does the font or PApplet control the size? (the font, ala java)
X without setting the font, SCREEN_SPACE comes out weird
o move SCREEN_SPACE into ScreenFont() class?
o   probably not, casey thinks screen space text is prolly more useful
o   that way can clear up some of the general confusion in the code
X textFont with a named font can use the renderer/os font
X   illustrator api can get the ps name from the java font name
X     since it's associated with the font file.. wee!
X   for postscript, can grab the real font
o   altho problem here is that really the fonts just need a name
o      since needs to render to screen as well
o      font has to be installed to get psname
X      fine because why would you embed a ps font that you don't have?
o need to resolve SCREEN_SPACE vs OBJECT_SPACE
o   can this be auto-detected with noDepth()? 
o   how does rotated text work?
o     PFont.rotate(180) rotate(PI)
o     or can this be detected from the matrix?
X don't use pixels to do screen space text inside PFont
X   add a function in PGraphics for direct pixel image impl 
X store the font name in the vlw font file (at the end)
o   could include multiple names for multi platforms
X get text impl stuff working properly
o look into fixing the texture mapping to not squash fonts
o   NEW_GRAPHICS totally smashes everything

friday postgame
X implement createFont()
X   with a .ttf does a create font internally (1.3+ only)
X     although the images aren't populated 
X     until a P2D/P3D/OPENGL tries to draw them, which triggers it
X     but if PGraphics2, just uses the built-in font
X   also works for font names and just creating them
X     if font name doesn't end with otf or ttf, then tries to create it
X change objectX/Y/Z to modelX/Y/Z
X PFont.list() to return string list of all the available fonts
X   probably not a mode of use that we really want to encourage
X   actually important because the whole graphicsdevice crap is silly
X     and we need a 1.1 versus 1.3/1.4 version
X implement printarr() as println() ?
X   actually deal with all the array types.. oy
X should nf() handle commas as well?
X   just add a basic nfc() version for ints and floats
o   yes, and add nf(int what) so that non-padded version works
o   but don't put commas into the zero-padded version
o   make nf/nfs/nfp not so weird
o   nf(PLUS, ...) nf(PAD, ...) nfc(PLUS, ...)
X unhex was broken for numbers bigger than 2^31

saturday late afternoon
X fix bug with openStream() and upper/lowercase stuff
X   do a better job of handling any kind of URLs in openStream()

sunday morning
X incorporate simon's new lighting code


0082 core
X make jdkVersion, jdkVersionName, platform, platformName variables
X additional note about screen sizes and displays
X sto instead of stop in present mode
X appears that opengl libraries weren't correctly added in 81?
X requestFocus() now called on gl canvas
X basic lights now work by default


0081 core
X background(PImage) now works in opengl
X when running externally, applets don't always get placed properly
X   if size is never set, then doesn't always layout
X   problem is in gl and in core, and is inconsistent
X   move more logic for layout into PApplet.. maybe a static method?
X   this way can avoid duplicating / breaking things
o what is the stroked version of a sphere? a circle?
X write list of params that can be passed to PApplet
o document in the code a note about how size() et al place themselves
X saveFrame was double-adding the save path because of save() changes

size(200, 200, P3D) - createGraphics and placement issues 
X make pappletgl work back inside papplet
X   and then size(300, 300, DEPTH) etc
X   get rid of opengl renderer menu
o   otherwise hint() to use the p5 renderer instead of java2d
X applet placement is screwy
X how to force PGraphics() instead of PGraphics2()
X   size(300, 200, P2D);
X size() doing a setBounds() is really bad
X   because it means things can't be embedded properly
o applets on osx (and windows) sometimes show up 20 pixels off the top 
X how to shut off rendering to screen when illustrator in use? 
X   need size(30000, 20000) for illustrator, problem in papplet
X   size(30000, 20000, ILLUSTRATOR)
X make Graphics2 et al load dynamically using reflection
X   can this be done with g2 and if exception just falls back to g1?
X   this way people can remove g1 by hand
o size() that changes renderer will throw nasty exception in draw()
X   or maybe that's ok? document that no changing renderers?
X take a look to see what needs to happen to get PAppletGL merged in
X   i.e. can i just extend GLCanvas?

present mode
o call present() from inside the code?
o   that if applet is 500x500, centers on a 800x600 window
X   no, that's nasty... use --present to launch in present window
X though how do you get the screen size? 
X   screen.width and screen.height? - yes
X write java 1.4 code for full screen version of PApplet
X   this might be used for presentation mode
X proper full screen code for present mode
X   why do mouse motion events go away in full screen mode
X   or with a Window object
X use screen manager to run present mode properly
X   set both versions to require java 1.4
X   change the Info.plist inside macosx
X   and add something to PdeBase to make sure that it's in 1.4
X running present mode with a bug in the program hoses things
X   make sure the program compiles before starting present mode


0080 core
X PApplet.saveFrame() is saving to sketch folder, PApplet.save() is not
X   PApplet.save() will save to the applet folder, 
X   but PImage.save() or PGraphics.save() will save only to the current
X   working directory, usually the Processing folder.
X removed static version of mask() from PImage
X   no more PImage.mask(theImage, maskImage)
X   just use theImage.mask(maskImage)
X PImage.filter() 
X   maybe use quasimondo's gaussian blur code?
X     http://incubator.quasimondo.com/processing/gaussian_blur_1.php
o   filter() on subsections? yes, in keeping with rest of api
X   no, in keeping with getting shit done
X   BLUR - write simple blur
X     how does photoshop handle this?
X   BLUR - add gaussian blur
X   email re: credit/attribution and descrepancy between algos
X forgot to mention the line hack to get points working in 78
X implemented PGraphicsGL.set(x, y, argb)
X implement PGraphicsGL.set(x, y, PImage)
X blend, copy, filter all implemented for opengl
X copy(Pimage, x, y) has become set(x, y, PImage)
X textMode -> textAlign
X   ALIGN_LEFT, ALIGN_CENTER, ALIGN_RIGHT -> LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT
X textSpace -> textMode
X   NORMAL_SPACE -> NORMALIZED, OBJECT_SPACE -> OBJECT
X text in a box is broken (at least for PGraphics2)
o   check to see if it's a rounding error with width()
o   get text rect working again (seems to be in infinite loop)
X   nope, was just that the space width wasn't being scaled up properly
X clean up the javadoc so no more errors
X change mbox to PFont.size? 
o   make width() return values based on natural size?
X   not a great idea.. plus java2d uses 1 pixel font for things
X email simon re: lighting api
X   things are actually more on track than expected
X camera is swapping colors in gl (on mac?)
X   in fact, all textures on mac were swapping colors
X   test this on windows to see if fixed
X sphere x,y,z,r or box w,h,d.. need to make them consistent
X   goodbye sphere(x, y, z, r)
o should available() be waiting() or something like that instead?
o go through and see what functions (no pixel ops?) frame recorders should have
X   decided instead to use recordFrame(PGraphics)
o remove SCREEN_SPACE altogether? 
X   can't do this for now

implemented in 79
X make sure arc goes in the right direction that we want it to
X   (make sure that PGraphics3 goes the same direction)


0079 core
X no changes to core in this release


0078 core
X text fixes
X   lines were getting horizontally mashed together
X   lines also getting vertically smashed together
X   make a note of the change to font.width()
X backwards rects and backwards ellipses weren't properly drawn
X   code now compensates for negative widths or swapped x1/x2
X what to do about backwards images
X imageMode() wasn't being set properly
X fix noLoop() not properly running
X   If noLoop() is called in setup(), nothing is drawn to the screen.
X also fix redraw() to include interrupt() again
X loadPixels throwing NPEs
X fixes to SCREEN_SPACE text not being sized properly
X loadPixels()/updatePixels() on screen space text (ouch)
X get SCREEN_SPACE text working again
X patch in newer jogl.. too many BSODs
X saveFrame seems to be broken
X   fixed for PGraphics2
X   fixed for PGraphicsGL
X   also implemented loadPixels/updatePixels for gl
X fix tint() with color and alpha for PGraphics2
X alpha() colors are inverted (white is opaque.. doesn't make sense)
X   should we swap this around? no - this is how photoshop works
X fix arc
X get() is back
X set camera.modified so that it draws properly
X it's annoying not having a copy() function inside PImage
X   formerly get() with no params
o   clone throws an exception
o   PImage constructor that takes itself?
o   PImage copy = new PImage(another);
X got rid of CONCAVE_POLYGON and CONVEX_POLYGON
X hack for points to work in opengl, but still not working broadly
X work on filter() functions
X   POSTERIZE - find simple code that does it?
X     there must be a straightforward optimized version of it
o   EDGES - find edges in casey's example is differen than photoshop
o     which version do people want with their stuff
X     edges filter removed
X several fixes to Movie and Camera to work with the new gfx model
X PImage.get(x, y, w, h) had a bug when things went off the edge
X set defaults for strokeCap and strokeJoin
X get() and gl images were broken for screen sizes less than full size
X fix arcs, were badly broken between java2d and pgraphics
X look at curve functions more closely
X   should we switch to curveVertex(1,2,3) (ala curveto)
X   because some confusion with mixing types of curves
o   make sure we don't want curveVertices(1,2,3,u,v)
o   also make test cases so that java2d and java11 behave the same
X implement PGraphics2.curveVertex()
X updatePixels() not setting PApplet.pixels
X   make loadPixels in PGraphics ignored, and put it in PApplet
X made loadStrings() and openStream(File) static again
X test loadPixels()/updatePixels()/saveFrame() on the pc
X   better, just assume that they need the endian swap
X fixed draw mode apps for opengl
X   (gl was missing a beginFrame)
X pmouseX, pmouseY are not working in OpenGL mode
X   (as they are working in Processing mode)

o screenX/Y aren't properly working for 2D points against a 3D matrix
o   (ryan alexander rounding bug)
o   Just to clarify, it works completely correctly with rounding
o   screenX/Y and also using the 3 arg version of translate - 
o   ie translate(hw,hh,0) instead of just translate(hw,hh). 
X   no longer an issue because moving to 2D and 3D modes
o PImage: remove the static versions of manipulators?
o   probably not, because they're inherited by PApplet
o   i.e. mask(image, themask); 
X   no PImage needed b/c PGraphics is a PImage
o colorMode(GRAY) to avoid stroke(0) causing trouble? 
o   or maybe get rid of stroke(0)? hrm


0077 core
X bring back pmouseX/Y using a tricky method of storing separate
X   values for inside draw() versus inside the event handler versions
X   debug handling, and make firstMouse public
X explicitly state depth()/nodepth()
X   don't allocate zbuffer & stencil until depth() is called
X arc with stroke only draws the arc shape itself
X   may need a 'wedge' function to draw a stroke around the whole thing
X only allocate stencil and zbuffer on first call to depth()
X   this will require changes to PTriangle and PLine inside their loops
X try running javadoc
X die() may need to throw a RuntimeException
o call filter() to convert RGB/RGBA/ALPHA/GRAY
o   cuz the cache is gonna be bad going rgb to rgba
X   don't bother, people can re-create the image or set cache null
X fix font coloring in PGraphics2
X fix tint() for PGraphics2
X get text working again
X   partially the problem is with ALPHA images
X     how should they be stored internally
X   also colored text, requires tint() to work properly
X move textMode and textSpace back out of PFont
X   use die() to fail in font situations
X   can't, just use a RuntimeException

covered in previous
X before graphics engine change, attach jogl stuff
X   need to try jogl to make sure no further changes
X   and the illustrator stuff
o massive graphics engine changes
o   move to new graphics engine
o     test with rgb cube, shut off smoothing
o   make sure line artifacts are because of smoothing
o   implement 2x oversampling for anti-aliasing
o renderers can plug in:
o   at direct api level
o     taking over all color() functions and vertex collection
o   at endShape() level
o     where vertices are collected by core and blit on endShape()
o     (takes polygons and lines)
o   at post tesselation level
o     takes only line segments and triangles to blit (dxf writer)
o api for file-based renderers
o   need to work this out since it will affect other api changes
o   size(0, 0) and then ai.size(10000, 20000)
o     size 0 is code for internal to not show any window
o   saveFrame(PRenderer) or saveFrame("name", PRenderer)
o   saveFrame gets called at the beginning of loop()
o     or is just a message to save the next frame (problem for anim)
X vertices max out at 512.. make it grow
X add gzipInput and gzipOutput
X light(x, y, z, c1, c2, c3, TYPE)
X   also BLight with same constructor, and on() and off() fxn
X make sure applet is stopping in draw mode
X loadImage() is broken on some machines
X   hacked for a fix in 72, but need to better coordinate with openStream()

postscript
X pushing all intelligence down into class that implements PMethods
o keep hints about type of geometry used to reconstruct
o   no special class, just uses public vars from PGraphics
o how to hook into curve rendering so that curve segments are drawn
o   maybe lines are rendered and sorted, 
o   but they point to an original version of the curve geometry 
o   that can be re-rendered 
o   also integrate catmull-rom -> bezier inverse matrices
o   even with the general catmull-rom, to render via ai beziers

api changes
X removed circle.. it's dumb when ellipse() is in there
X   (it's not like we have square() in the api)
X arcMode is gone.. just uses ellipseMode()
X save tga and tif methods are static and public
X imageMode(CORNER) and CORNERS are the only usable versions
X alpha(PImage) is now called mask() instead
X   already have an alpha() function that gets alpha bits
X on start, mouseX is 0.. how to avoid?
X   use firstMouse variable.. figure out naming
X get frame recording working
X   not tested, but at least it's there

image stuff
o could also do PImage2, which would need a getPixels() before messing w/ it
o   bad idea, distinction not clear
o even in java 1.1, could use regular java.awt.Image and require getPixels()
o   -> 1.1 wouldn't help anything, because needs pixels to render, oops
X the updatePixels() in PGraphics has to be overridden (from PImage)
X   to make itself actually update on-screen
X   actually, should be no different than the check_image function
X PGraphics2 and PGraphicsGL will need loadPixels() to be called
X   in order to read pixels from the buffer
X loadPixels() and updatePixels() prolly should be shut off in opengl
X   make people use get() instead to grab sub-images
X   PGraphicsGL.copy() needs to be overridden.. use glDrawBitmap
o loadImage() needs to handle 1.1 vs 1.3 loading
o   set image.format to be BUFFERED? no.. just use RGBA always
o have a flag to always use the cache, i.e. with BufferedImage
o   turn that off when someone modifies it (nope, no need to)
X PImage.getPixels(), updatePixels(), updatePixels(x, y, w, h), 
o   PImage.setPixels(int another[]);
X imageMode(CENTER) is weird for copy() and updatePixels()
X   perhaps copy() and get() ignore imageMode and use xywh or x1y1x2y2?
X   or disallow imageMode(CENTER) altogether?
o in java 1.3, getPixels() can call getRGB() via reflection
o   cache.getClass().getName().equals("BufferedImage")
X readPixels/writePixels?
X   has to happen, since this is so fundamental to gl as well
X loadImage in 1.3 leaves pixels[] null (not in 1.1)
X   1.3 plus gl is a problem, since conflicting caches
X   gl has no need for a bufferedimage tho
X     so maybe checks to see if the cache is a BufferedImage
X     if it is, calls getPixels to set the int array
X     then replaces cache with glimageache
X     pappletgl loadimage could take care of this instead
X       calls super.loadImage(), if cache != null, proceed..
X       this is prolly a mess
X PImage.getPixels() and PImage.getPixels(x, y, w, h) ->
X   (the xywh version still allocates the entire array, but only updates those)
X   only needed for java2d
X   not (necessarily) needed when loading images,
X     but definitely needed when setting pixels on PGraphics
X PImage.updatePixels() and PImage.updatePixels(x, y, w, h)
X   (this is actually just setModified)
X   in opengl, marks all or some as modified
X     so next time it's drawn, the texture is updated PGraphicsGL.image()
X   in java2d, updates the BufferedImage on next draw
X can't use regular getPixels() on PGraphics, because its image isn't 'cache'
X   also, the cache may be used to draw the whole surface as a gl texture (?)
X   not a problem for the main PGraphics, but for any others created to draw on

opengl
X make light() functions actually do something in PGraphicsGL
X box() and sphere() working again
X make opengl work in draw mode
X   set initial size using --size=
X color channels seem to be swapped on windows in image example
X   check on the mac to see what it looks like

X default to single byte input from serial port
X   and add serial.setBuffer() for message length as alternative
X   or serial.setDelimiter() to fire message on delim
X     named it bufferUntil();


0076 core
X no changes, only launcher issues


0075
X textureMode(NORMAL_SPACE)  screws up the image() command
X   image() appears to require IMAGE_SPACE to function properly. 
X added focusGained() and focusLost()
X lots of changes to internal naming of vars
X screenX(x, y) and screenY(x, y) added for noDepth()
X add TRIANGLE_FAN
X eyeX, eyeY etc have been renamed cameraX/Y/Z, and cameraNear/Far
X modify targa and tiff writing routines to break into header writing
X   writeTIFF, writeHeaderTIFF, writeTGA, writeHeaderTGA
X MAJOR CHANGE: RGBA becomes ARGB for accuracy
o uv coords > 1 shouldn't clamp, they should just repeat ala opengl
o   actually i think opengl has a setting for it
o remove need to use depth() at the beginning
X   need only be set once
X pmouseX is broken again
X   remove pmouseX/Y altogether
X   maintain things a bit different
o   email the beta@ list to see how people are using pmouseX
X changed PMovie.length to PMovie.duration
X move around/simplify loadImage() inside PApplet 
X working to add more die() statements inside PApplet
o can ALPHA fonts work using the other replace modes?

fixed in previous releases
X text stuff
X   text() with alignment doesn't work for multiple lines
X   don't change the size of a font when in screen space mode
X   patch rotated text (from visualclusto) into bfont
X   what sort of api? textSpace(ROTATED) ?
X   rotated text has a bug for when it goes offscreen

opengl
X why is the thing hanging until 'stop' is hit?
X   what happens when stop is hit that sets it free?
X   (at what point does it start working properly?)
X cache needs to also make things a power of 2
X   if images are already a power of 2, then needn't re-alloc
X cacheIndex needs to be set to -1 when the image is modified
X   or maybe have a modified() function?
X debug why certain spots are having errors (see 'problem here' notes)
X   INVALID_OPERATION after drawing lines for cube
X fix noLoop bug
X remove errors when drawing textures
X reverse y coordinates
X make play button un-highlight with opengl
X   also make window move messages work properly
X   very necessary, since opens window at 100x100
X   problem was the threading issues
X bring back renderer menu
X   reading/saving pref for opengl renderer
X remove cameraMode(PERSPECTIVE) on each frame
X   why is the first one failing?
X still threading issues with running opengl 
X   threading really horks up dual processor machine.. 
X   first run hangs until quit 
X   though doesn't seem to replicate when p5 is restarted
X make sure background() gets called at least once with opengl
X   otherwise screen never actually updates
X beginFrame() around setup()
X   draw mode stuff happens inside setup.. 
o   or maybe need to get better at size() inside of draw() ? 
X   make this consistent with the regular PApplet
X     otherwise things are going to be weird/difficult for debugging


0074 core
X removed zbuffer precision hack in PLine to improve z ordering
X no longer set g.dimensions = 3 when using vertex(x, y, 0)


0073 core
X tweak to fonts to use TEXT_ANTIALIAS because of macosx @#$(*&
X loadImage() is broken on some machines
X   hacked for a fix in 72, but need to better coordinate with openStream()


0072 core
X make m00, m01 etc public
X hack to make loadImage() work 
X   cache settings are ignored, may be slow as hell
X make hints[] no longer static
X   they weren't properly resetting


0071 core
X properly swap alpha values when lines need to be rendered backwards
X make cursor() commands public
X ltext and rtext for screen space stuff
X ltext is broken when it goes y < 0 or y > height
X ltext & rtext completely working
X make sure font creator is making fonts properly fixed width
X   probably not using java charwidth for the char's width
X   probably wasn't using textFont() properly
X now that it's actually a key, should it be a char? (what's keyChar?)
X   that way println(c) would work a little better..
X libraryCalls() not properly working for pre, post, or draw()
o image(myg, x, y) doesn't work but image(myg, x, y, w, h) does
o   (image kind prolly not set right and so image() gets pissy)
o   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1091798655

text fixes
X make text rect use rectMode for placement
X if a word (no spaces) is too long to fit, insert a 'space'
X move left/center/right aligning into the font class
X   otherwise text with alignment has problems with returns
X could PFont2 be done entirely with reflection?
X   that way other font types can properly extend PFont
o font char widths from orator were not fixed width
o   may just need to regenerate. if not, widths may be set wrong.


0070 core
o check ordering of split() in java vs perl for regexp
X don't include empty chars in font builder
X   .vlw font files are enormous with full charset
X   check to see if the character exists before adding it to the font
X fixed (unreported) problem with char lookup code
o split() with multiple args (i think this is completed)
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1078985667
X trim() not chop().. whups

X use random.nextFloat() because it's faster
X make grayscale image in p5
X   could be used with alpha() to properly set alpha values
X   made into filter(GRAYSCALE) and filter(BLACK_WHITE) functions
X make g.depthTest settable as a hint
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1096303102;start=0
X #ifdef to remove client and server code as well
X need to resolve issues between rendering screen/file
X   illustrator-based rendering needs to work for ars projects
X   screen may be 400x400 pixels, but file be 36x36"

X   if people have other threads they've spawned, impossible to stop

cleaning up
X make bagel more usable as standalone
X   breakout BGraphics (have its own BImage)
o   breakout BApplet into BComponent ? (fix out-of-bounds mouse - doesn't)

o new sphere code from toxi
o   already added a while back
o   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1067005325

X fix loadImage to be inside PApplet

040715
X saveFrame() to a folder horks things up if a mkdirs() is required
X   on macosx, this makes things hang; on windows it complains
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081706752;start=0
X decide on whether to use PTools
X   decided against, since it doesn't help anything
X   and some functions need the applet object, so it's just annoying
o   i.e. move math functions into utility library
o   check what other functions require PGraphics to exist but shouldn't
o   look at BGraphics to see if setting an 'applet' could be used
o     then other than that, if no applet set, no connection to PApplet

040716
X change font api to not use leading() as a way to reset the leading
X   resetLeading and resetSize are the things
X embed all available chars from a font, so japanese, etc works

040727
X incorporated NO_FLYING_POO line/poly hack developed for axel

040902
X sort() should return an array, rather than sort in place
X fix binary function, had wrong offset number
X   casey: i wan't able to get binary() to work at all:
o Typography: Helix won't compile 
o   works fine, just needs BFont -> PFont
X standalone 'alpha' function for PImage (static methods for alpha fxns)
X Image: Edge, Image: Blur: Alpha not set? The error is easier to see on Blur
X   turns out bounds checking wasn't working properly on colors

X   but println(Object o) is very needed

040919
X loop/noLoop setup

040920
X make loop/noLoop work properly
X fixes/changes to key and mousehandling
X   tab key not working?

X add redraw() function
X   call redraw() on the first time through (to force initial draw)
X   otherwise noLoop() in setup means no drawing happens at all

040920 evening
X defaults for PApplet and PGraphics are different
o   PGraphics has none.. PApplet has fill/stroke
X   actually not the case, only that wasn't calling decent superclass
X set PImage.format as RGB by default? 
X   this was problem with rendering an image from PGraphics on board

X sizing bug fix to fonts, they now match platform standards
X   however, *this will break people's code*
X text in a box not written
X   make sure to note in the docs that text/textrect position differently
o     for this reason, should it be called textrect()?
X font heights and leading are bad
X   get good values for ascent and descent
X   if ScreenFont subclasses PFont.. can that be used in textFont()?
X check to make sure the tops of fonts not getting chopped in font builder


0069 bagel
X text(x, y, z)
X fixed camera modes / replaced how isometric is handled

X   ISOMETRIC was completely broken.. need to implement properly
X     also, the default camera is perspective

X   if the user wants a custom camera, call cameraMode(CUSTOM); before begin()
X printMatrix() and printCamera() to output the matrices for each
X more functions made static (loadStrings, loadBytes) that could be
X   print() commands in BApplet were among these
X die() command to exit an application or just stall out an applet
X   die(String error) and die(String error, Exception e) 
X more documentation in comments for functions
X chop() function that properly also handles nbsp
X join() was handled weird
X run nf() and nfs() on arrays
X nfp() to show plus sign
X toInt, toFloat, toDouble (nf is for toString.. inconsistent)
o split() function splits strings instead of splitStrings()
o   ints() converts an array of strings/doubles/floats to an int array
o split() should also use StringTokenizer
o   to do countTokens() and then stuff into an array
o shave() or chomp() or trim() method to remove whitespace on either side
o   including unicode nbsp
X min() and max() with three values were broken (now fixed)

X   fixed it, also modified behavior of split() with a delimeter
X   previously, it would remove the final delimeter and an empty entry
X   but that's now disabled, since the split cmd is very specific
X code from toxi to support .tga files in loadImage
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1078459847;start=0
