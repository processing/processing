_ add warning system for pgraphics, rather than runtime exceptions
_   keep array of warning strings, and booleans for whether they've called

add to reference
_ update the reference to cover parseXxxx() stuff
_   also add notes about parseInt/Float(blah, otherwise)
_ also parseInt and parseFloat, how they can return another number or NaN
_   should the default be NaN or 0?
_ background() with an image ignores the tint.. it's basically like set()
_ get/set are faster way draw screen space images, but no tint, no translations
_ make sure the docs include "beginShape() cannot be nested"
_   also add error messages to the renderers
_   also note that ellipse() et al use beginShape()
_   and that java2d should complain if people try it

createGraphics() mess
_ text characters showing up as opaque rectangles in tga files
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=641
_   solution is to implement alpha compositing across all of P3D 
_   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing
_ when drawing into a JAVA2D surface, have to call loadPixels()
_   to draw it later with P3D (or OPENGL prolly)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1171574044
_ an offscreen JAVA2D graphics needs loadPixels() before being drawn
_   i.e. offscreen JAVA2D, then image() with OPENGL renderer as main
_   needs to be marked as its cache needs an update, but not its pixels
X begin/endPixels.. change has been made
_   on PImage, sets a flag that marks it to be updated on next render
_   for PImage, begin after an end is ignored, no pixels are re-loaded
_     the "changed" bit gets turned off when the PImage is rendered
_   for subclasses of PGraphics, the reload bit needs to be set on endFrame
_   filter() checks to see if inside begin/endPixels, if so doesn't call
o   if line() is called inside beginpixels, call updatepixels?
_   when NPE on line with pixels[], suggest user includes beginPixels
_ need to test/straighten out load/update pixels
_   loadPixels() and updatePixels() only need to be used when 
_   touching pixels[]. All other functions including get(), set(),
_   filter(), etc shouldn't need them. 
_ fjen says blend() doens't work in JAVA2D
_   the functions are fairly well separated now in PMethods
_   just go through all the stuff to make sure it's setting properly
_ don't do a loadPixels unless an updatePixels has completed
_   tho this won't affect anything, since either it's an image buffer
_   or it's the PGraphics object, which does an updatePixels() immediately
_ if (modified) don't loadPixels again, just ignore it
_   make a note that updatePixels() only sets a flag in PImage
_     (but not PGraphics, which does it immediately)

tint/textures
_ an image marked RGB but with 0s for the alpha won't draw in JAVA2D
_   images with 0x00 in their high bits being drawn transparent
_   also if transparency set but RGB is setting, still honors transparency
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=351
_ tint() and noTint() switching problem in P2D
_   this should be a quick fix
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=222
_ related to the fill bugs: when fill is identical, no fill applied
_   actually tint() should take over for fill as per-vertex color
_   when textured images are being used
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=169
_ tint() should set texture color, fill() is ignored with textures
_ fix tint() for PGraphics3 (what could be wrong?)
_   tint() honoring alpha but not colored tint
_   maybe not setting fill color when drawing textures
_   guessing it's an implementation issue in sami's renderer
_   check with the a_Displaying example and tint(255, 0, 0, 100);
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=90
_   is fill() not coloring textures properly?
_     don't need to apply tint() to textures, supposed to use fill color
Hope this helps:  If you haven't tracked it down yet... it's in PTriangle, when a flat-shaded textured triangle is drawn, then the rgb of the tint isn't used.  So, for example, if the triangle renderer branches to drawsegment_texture32() the tint rgb won't be used, whereas if it branches to drawsegment_gouraud_texture32() then the tint rgb WILL be used.  Alpha gets used from tint, because all alpha has to do is be != 255, but for rgb to get used they values have to differ among vertices (which won't happen via the image() routine for example).  The quick fix might be to insert an additional test in setIntensities() to check if parent.tint is true, and if so then force gouraud shading, INTERPOLATE_RGB=true.


_ key and mouse events delivered out of order

_ look into capabilities stuff from mike creighton
_   also sets the aa mode on the pc so it no longer needs control panel bunk

_ loadBytes() and saveStream() functions badly need optimization!
_   don't bother using a buffering stream, just handle internally. gah!

_ when using createFont("xxxx.ttf"), should use textMode(SHAPE) with PDF
_   because ttf files will not be installed on the system when opening pdf

_ copy() should automatically call updatePixels()

_ textAlign(CENTER) with P3D and OPENGL produces messy result
_   probably rounding error with the images

_ "this file is named" errors don't like subdirectories
_   need to strip off past the file separator or something
_ figure out why 1024x768 image takes 3.5 seconds to load

_ gl smoothing.. how to disable polygon but keep line enabled
_   or at least make a note of this?
_   leave smooth off, get the gl object, then enable line smooth


threading [1.0]
_ introduce calc()
_ major threading overhaul before 1.0 (compendium)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511
_ applet sizing issues with external vm
_   could this possibly be related to the linux bug?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=430
_ alloc() stuff not fixed because of thread halting
_   problem where alloc happens inside setup(), so, uh..
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=369
_   should instead create new buffer, and swap it in next time through
_ fix the internal file chooser so that people don't need to make their own
_   threading is a problem with inputFile() and inputFolder()
_   dynamically load swingworker?
_ sonia (and anything awt) is locking up on load in rev 91
_   prolly something w/ the threading issues
_   paint is synchronized in 0091
_     however this is a necessity, otherwise nasty flickering ensues
_     and using a "glock" object seems to completely deadlock
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=46
_ claim that things are much slower in 107 vs 92
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Suggestions;action=display;num=1141763531
_ need to move off anim off the main event thread
_   move away from using method like display
_ too much object creation in java2d
_   causes inconsistency/hiccups as the gc runs?
_ fix the flicker in java2d mode
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=122
_   framerate(30) is still flickery and jumpy..
_   not clear what's happening here
_   appears to be much worse (unfinished drawing) on macosx
_     try turning off hw accel on the mac to see if that's the problem
_ framerate that's reported is out of joint with actual
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=512
_   accuracy of frame timer is incorrect
_   seems to be aliasing effect of low resolution on millis()
_   so rates coming out double or half of their actual
_   probably need to integrate over a rolling array of 10 frames or so
_ frameRate() speeds up temporarily if CPU load drops dramatically
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=297
_   perhaps add a hint(DISABLE_FRAMERATE_DAMPER)
_ sketches lock up when system time is changed
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=639

point()
_ gl points not working again
_   need to implement point() as actual gl points
_   this means adding points to the pipeline
_ point() doesn't work with some graphics card setups
_   particularly with opengl and java2d
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=121
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=269
_ point() issues
_   point() being funneled through beginShape is terribly slow
_     go the other way 'round
_   sometimes broken, could be a problem with java 1.5? (was using win2k)
noStroke();
colorMode(RGB, 100);  
for(int i=0; i<100; i++) {  
  for(int j=0; j<100; j++) {  
    stroke(i, j, 0);  
    point(i, j);  
  }  
}  
As an aside, set() is at least 10x faster, and 
perhaps should be used in these examples anyway.

_   kinda seems problematic and prone to errors?

_ what's up with stop() vs exit()?
_   need to get this straightened for p5 (i.e. bc has this problem)
_   make sure the main() doesn't exit until the applet has finished
_   i.e. problem with main calling itself multiple times in Alpheus
_   if exit() (or stop) is called, then System.exit() gets called,

_ cameraXYZ doesn't seem to actually be used for anything
_   since camera functions don't even look at it or set it

_ add notes about fixing serial on the mac to the faq (and link to bug)

_ beginFrame()/beginDraw() and defaults()
_   when should these be called, when not?
_   seems as though the begin/end should happen inside beginRaw/Record
_   defaults() gets called by the size() command in PApplet

_ endRaw() is a problem with hint(ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT)
_   because the triangles won't be rendered by the time endRaw() is called
_   force depth sorted triangles to flush

_ check into ricard's problems with beginRecord()
_ should beginRecord inherit settings from its parent renderer?
_   textFont() is null on beginRecord

GRAPHICS LIBRARY

A hybrid of OpenGL (3D Graphics) and some aspects of Postscript (Fill, Stroke)
The graphics library was formerly called Bagel.


CORE / PApplet

_ detect when using full screen
_   and if so, remove decoration and don't bother with bg present frame
_   frame.setUndecorated(true);
_   frame.setLocation(0,0);
_   size(screen.width,screen,height); 
_ would be cool if could sort w/o the sort class..
_   meaning use reflection to sort objects, just by implementing a few methods
_   would be much simpler and less confusing than new Sort() etc 
_   or would it be ridiculously slow?
_ make a PException that extends RuntimeException but packages an ex?
_   http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html
_ is mousePressed broken with noLoop() or redraw()?
_ check for what else inside PApplet should be static
_   maybe catch RuntimeExceptions in the called sub-functions
_   that way more stuff can be static w/o losing useful error handling
_   (emitting errors when closest to source.. i.e. w/ the filename)
_ size() inside draw is missing a new call to cameraMode, etc
_ fix param() to use a sketch.properties file when run as an app
_   make this also be used in generating the html file
_ fix link() to handle relative URLs
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081710684;start=0
_ put SecurityException things around file i/o for applets
_   rather than checking online(), since applets might be signed
_ saveFrame() at the end of a draw mode program is problematic
_   app might exit before the file has finished writing to disk
_   need to block other activity inside screenGrab until finished
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081706752
_ problems with defining fill(255) vs fill(0xff808080)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1083650609
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1082481891
_ test winding polygons in different directions
_ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
_ is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
_   may be correct, it worked for nik
_ inside draw() mode, delay() does nothing
_   delay might be a good way to signal drawing to the screen/updating
_ catch security exceptions around applet i/o calls
_   not just for saving files, but provide better error msgs when
_     attempting to download from another server
_ ed's thread re: fullscreen strategies
_   could add a new BApplet that uses BufferStrategy?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1081335361;start=15
_ placement of 100x100 items is odd
_   happens with P3D and maybe also P2D?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=128
_ fileInput() and fileOutput() may not agree with draw()
_   not yet verified
_   can only be used inside of setup()?
_ cellular automata examples broken
_ size() has memory limitations (pitaru)
_   catch OutOfMemoryError inside size() and let the user know
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1038847001
_ files not in the data folder (works in env, not in sketch)


CORE / PApplet - main()

_ refactor PApplet.main() and Runner.startInternal() to remove duplication
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=245
_ present mode is flakey.. applet doesn't always come up
_   seems like hitting stop helps shut it down?
_   is full screen window not being taken down properly?
_   has this fixed itself, or is it an issue with launching externally?
_ implement full screen mode.. this takes over the screen as best it can
_   size(screen.width, screen.height, OPENGL);
_   if size is screen.width and screen.height, does its best
_   needs to get the size of the main screen
_   this probably works but just needs to be tested
_   exceptions in full screen mode will quit the app completely
_     can't keep window open because things are hosed
_   default is that full screen app doesn't cover multiple displays
_     this is fine since opengl can't usually go across both
_     but include an example for how to use full in gl 
_ ability to select monitor via preferences panel
_   this applies to any applet that's run externally currently (verify)
_   make it also work with anything that's run inside of p5 itself
_     this means changing the frame creation code inside Runner
_   check current present code with multiple monitors
_ hitting cmd-q when an applet is running quits p5 (on macosx)
_   but cmd-q when running externally is ok because it just quits
_   is there a way to catch cmd-q when running a sketch? 
_     so that it could avoid quitting if the sketch hasn't been stopped
_     or if the sketch window is foremost
_     maybe a hack where a new menubar is added? 


CORE / PFont and text()

_ P3D smooshes the top row of pixels when drawing text (or images)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=466
_ some fonts broken in java 1.5 on osx have changed again
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=407
_   filed as bug #4769141 with apple
_   http://bugreport.apple.com/
_   appears that asking for the postscript name no longer works
o   fix "create font" and associated font stuff to straighten it out
X   was grabbing the wrong native font with ico sketch 
X   seems that the psname is no longer a good way to grab the font? related?
_ available font issues
_   is getFontList returning a different set of fonts from device2d?
_     try it out on java 1.3 versus 1.4
_   getAllFonts() not quite working for many fonts
_   i.e. Orator Std on windows.. macosx seems to be ok
_   is getFamilyNames() any different/better?
_   when did this break? 1.4.1? 1.4.x vs 1.3?
_   may be that cff fonts won't work?
_   or is it only those with ps names?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1117445969
_ leading looks too big, at least in PGraphics2 with news gothic
_   though it may be the converted version of the .ttf?
_ font encoding issues 
_   java seems to force straight windows encoding.. (problem for pi fonts)
_   opentype/cff fonts don't work with live loading from the app
_   many (all?) opentype fonts won't show up or aren't supported
_     this may be only cff fonts that have trouble
_   when encoding is not the standard encoding, problematic
_     so sonata otf and sonata don't seem to have any chars at all
_ text() with a z coordinate is now using translate, very slow
X   also puts up a weird error message about translate() in 2D mode
_ make screen space fonts use get/set as well?
_   too much to debug on their own
_   unfortunately tint not set with setImpl, but...
_ optimize textMode(MODEL) with textMode(SCREEN)
_   in PGraphics and PGraphics3, check to see if matrix is within epsilon
_   of one of the rotation matrices (many fewer steps) 
_   if identity, or just translate, or a rotate, make OBJECT into SCREEN
_ not having kerning really blows
_   could this be pulled from the OpenType font stuff? 
_   it could be placed at the end of the file
_ not having fractional widths on small fonts really blows
_   screen space text looks crappy
_ working with vector fonts? 
_   need to be able to handle shapes within shapes (reverse winding)
_   ftgl: main code is in FTVectoriser

_ image outofmemoryerror for casey's students
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=355
_   this may be related to a ton of other memory bugs
_ for a PGraphics2D, should its image cache object be the memoryimagesource?
_ is the texture[] array in PGraphics3D causing the problems with memory?
_   actually it's a PGraphicsGL problem.. 
_   maybe the image binding not getting unbound?
_ loading lots of images is a problem, describe how to unload
_   is it possible? necessary to call delay(5) or something?
_ don't grab pixels of java2d images unless asked
_   this is the difference between a lot of loadPixels() and not
_   so important to have it in before beta if that's the change

PGraphicsOpenGL

_ opengl mipmaps are leaking (regression in spite of #150 fix)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=610
_ ortho() behaving differently in P3D vs OPENGL
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=100
_   only happens on the first round
_ in opengl mode, use its tesselator
_   because the vertex calls can just come right back to regular vertex calls
_   this way we can also implement breakShape() for opengl
_ with opengl optimizations via call lists..
_   watch out to make sure raw recording still works
_   (optimizations will have to be disabled to some extent)
_ look into using glu quadrics to handle shape geometries quickly
_ optimizations to opengl
_   disabling error reporting (what's taking it so long?)
_     maybe use a hint() to enable it? or a getError() function?
_   make cached display list of filled/non-filled ellipse.. rect.. etc
_     these don't work when the vertex colors change, but..
_   or maybe should be using vertex arrays?
_ maybe break out a separate timage object in textures?
_   needs tindex and tbuffer, both gl specific
_     and for tpixels and twidth/theight, could use another PImage
_   under assumption that most will just need an extra image object
_   this could also be used by people eventually to control tex themselves
_   or maybe call the object "texture"?
_   in opengl lib, need beginTexture(PImage) and endTexture()
_   this will be helpful to have access to the raw texture data
_   that way it can be re-bound by itself, and ppl can write directly to it
_ textMode(SCREEN) is broken for opengl
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=426
_ textSpace(SCREEN) for opengl and java2d
_   don't use loadPixels for either
_   use font code to set the cached color of the font, then call set()
_   although set() with alpha is a little different..
_ resizing opengl applet likely to cause big trouble
_   componentlistener should prolly only do size() command outside of draw
_ make the opengl textmode shape stuff get better and use PShape
_ make textMode(SHAPE) faster in opengl
_   cache for tyhpe should be per-renderer
_   because opengl needs vectors, but also the image cache for textures
_ polygon z-order depth sorting with alpha in opengl
_   complete the implementation of hint() with proper implementation
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=176
_ opengl needs to shut itself down properly when closing applet
_   otherwise can crash the whole browser
_ get rid of some of the sillier IntBuffer stuff where it's not needed
_   use the version of the prototypes that use an offset into the array
_   need to test performance either way
_ make a note about the anti-aliasing types in the faq
_   polygon vs line etc.. may want to enable lines but disable polys
_ invocationtargetexception in gl with aioobe:
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1115185737
_ resolve ARGB versus RGBA versus just A issues for fonts
_   make sure that current scenario works identically on mac
_   if so, just switch the image code to expect alpha in the high bits
_   fonts probably need to be RGBA, not ALPHA style images
_   there's nothing really ALPHA about them?
_ gl alpha on images when flipped around backwards
_   will sorting based on depth help this? also ask simon for ideas
_ rewrite getImpl/setImpl inside opengl
_ bit shifting in opengl, get down to 2 ops by using other image modes
_   i.e. ABGR_EXT might allow for just two shifts instead of 4
_ allow access to native pixel buffer in opengl and power of 2
_   so that no need to copy/update everything
_ need to write an error if people try to use opengl with 1.3 (i.e. on export)
_   don't let users with java < 1.4 load OPENGL
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Contribution_3DOpenGL;action=display;num=1114368123;start=3
_ strokeWeight() doesn't work in opengl or p3d
_ how to handle gluTessVertex calls
_   need to re-map through the regular "vertex" command, 
_   but that makes things messy because the glu calls make calls to vertex()
_   and i don't want an additional "pathVertex()" function


PGraphicsAI

_ illustrator export / rendering mode
_   also postscript or pdf export?
_   update illustrator code to use core api
_     even if not actually working properly.. just in naming of things
_   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
_   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
_     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl


PShape
_ for subclasses, make it easy to grab the structure of vertices
_   actually, just use PShape internally and this will be easier
_ for PShape, need to be able to set the origin (flash people)


LATER

_ Use getContextClassLoader() instead of Class.forName()
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514
_ add a timer("functionname", 45) method
_   this can be used to schedule something to happen at a specific time
_   or import the swing timer (for actionPerformed)
X   look into javascript timers to see how they work
_   also add interval("functionname", 40)
_   and thread("functionname");
_   problem is that this will 
_ cmyk version of tiff encoder code?
_ because 'color' isn't a real data type
_   color(0, 0, 0, 0) produces black
_     because color(0, 0, 0, 0) creates an int that is simply '0'
_     although fill(0, 0, 0, 0) does the right thing
_     also, rgb255 not getting set
_     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382
_   should fill(c) instead be fillColor(c)?
_   should color(123, 4, 99) instead be createColor()?
_   gray that's greater than the colorMode() can produce strange colors
_     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=432
_ add stroke() to type
_   more for doing outlines-only and that sort of business
_ gradients
_   use gradients in a class for the svg lib for now
_   don't add api to main p5 stuff (though maybe setPaint/noPaint api?)
_   gradient-painted lines and fills
_     java2d will do both line and fill, illusfarter only does fills
_   gradients not supported in java2d
