o textAscent() should probably be g.textAscent instead
o   more like textLeading() etc
X   nope, because it requires grabbing a font metrics object and other calculations
X bezierDetail, curveDetail made public

nixed or fixed in previous releases
X textMode(SCREEN) having issues on Mac OS X

_ prevent PGraphics.save() from inserting a file prefix
_   so that people can use absolute paths
_   or add a version that takes a file object

_ recordFrame() and beginFile()/endFile()
_   finalize api with more work on multi-page pdf
_   how to deal with triangles/lines and triangleCount and lineCount
_     maybe just need a triangleImpl and lineImpl
_     because it's too messy to retain the triangle objects and info
_ when using things like PGraphicsPDF, need to not resize window
_   if it doesn't display to the screen, needs to never show a window
_   basically if the main gfx context isn't viewable, close the window
_   since it may have already been opened at 100x100

_ get creating new PGraphics/2/3 working again
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=92
_   maybe createGraphics(200, 200) to create same as source
_   createGraphics(200, 200, P2D) to create 2D from 3D
_   also, drawing a PGraphics2 doesn't seem to work
_   new PGraphics2 objects are set as RGB, but on loadPixels/updatePixels
_     they're drawn as transparent and don't have their high bits set
_ why aren't background() / defaults() being called for opengl?

_ sonia is locking up on load in rev 91
_   prolly something w/ the threading issues

_ PApplet.main(new String[] { "classname }) won't pass in args.. grr
_   PApplet.main(append(new String[] { "classname }, args));

_ need to test/straighten out load/update pixels
_   loadPixels() and updatePixels() only need to be used when 
_   touching pixels[]. All other functions including get(), set(),
_   filter(), etc shouldn't need them. 
_ fjen says blend() doens't work in JAVA2D
_   the functions are fairly well separated now in PMethods
_   just go through all the stuff to make sure it's setting properly
_ don't do a loadPixels unless an updatePixels has completed
_   tho this won't affect anything, since either it's an image buffer
_   or it's the PGraphics object, which does an updatePixels() immediately
_ if (modified) don't loadPixels again, just ignore it
_   make a note that updatePixels() only sets a flag in PImage
_     (but not PGraphics, which does it immediately)

GRAPHICS LIBRARY

A hybrid of OpenGL (3D Graphics) and some aspects of Postscript (Fill, Stroke)
The graphics library was formerly called Bagel.


CORE / PApplet

_ typed version of array functions:
_   append(), shorten(), splice, slice, subset, concat, reverse
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=115
_ would be cool if could sort w/o the sort class..
_   meaning use reflection to sort objects, just by implementing a few methods
_   would be much simpler and less confusing than new Sort() etc 
_   or would it be ridiculously slow?
_ make a PException that extends RuntimeException but packages an ex?
_   http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html
_ is mousePressed broken with noLoop() or redraw()?
_ check for what else inside PApplet should be static
_   maybe catch RuntimeExceptions in the called sub-functions
_   that way more stuff can be static w/o losing useful error handling
_   (emitting errors when closest to source.. i.e. w/ the filename)
_ ComponentListener is probably what's needed for resize() 
_   need to make sure that components can be resized properly via size()
_   or that it properly responds to a setBounds() call
_ allow save(), saveFrame() et al to properly pass in absolute paths
_   (so that it doesn't always save to the applet folder)
_   could require that save() takes an absolute path?
_ size() inside draw is missing a new call to cameraMode, etc
_ framerate(30) is still flickery and jumpy..
_ fix param() to use a sketch.properties file when run as an app
_   make this also be used in generating the html file
_ fix link() to handle relative URLs
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081710684;start=0
_ put SecurityException things around file i/o for applets
_   rather than checking online(), since applets might be signed
_ saveFrame() at the end of a draw mode program is problematic
_   app might exit before the file has finished writing to disk
_   need to block other activity inside screenGrab until finished
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081706752
_ problems with defining fill(255) vs fill(0xff808080)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1083650609
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1082481891
_ too many push() will silently stop the applet inside a loop
_ test winding polygons in different directions
_ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
_ better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
_ is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
_   may be correct, it worked for nik
_ inside draw() mode, delay() does nothing
_   delay might be a good way to signal drawing to the screen/updating
_ catch security exceptions around applet i/o calls
_   not just for saving files, but provide better error msgs when
_     attempting to download from another server
_ array utilities on Object[] are worthless.. fix it with reflection?
_   see if reflection will allow expand for all class types
_ ed's thread re: fullscreen strategies
_   could add a new BApplet that uses BufferStrategy?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1081335361;start=15
_ don't cache stuff from loadStrings and others
_   mac java vm won't give up old version of file
_   or use setUseCaches(false)
_ 404 error because first searches applet directory on zipdecode
_ should image i/o and sound i/o be moved into PImage and PSound?
_   how to load external encoders/decoders
_ placement of 100x100 items is odd
_   happens with P3D and maybe also P2D?
_ scripts: how to make a long setup() sleep so that things don't lock way up
_ fileInput() and fileOutput() may not agree with draw()
_   not yet verified
_   can only be used inside of setup()?
_ cellular automata examples broken
_ size() has memory limitations (pitaru)
_   catch OutOfMemoryError inside size() and let the user know
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1038847001
_ files not in the data folder (works in env, not in sketch)


CORE / PApplet - main()

_ present mode is flakey.. applet doesn't always come up
_   seems like hitting stop helps shut it down?
_   is full screen window not being taken down properly?
_ implement full screen mode.. this takes over the screen as best it can
_   size(screen.width, screen.height, OPENGL);
_   if size is screen.width and screen.height, does its best
_   needs to get the size of the main screen
_ ability to select monitor via preferences panel
_   this applies to any applet that's run externally currently (verify)
_   make it also work with anything that's run inside of p5 itself
_     this means changing the frame creation code inside Runner
_ check current present code with multiple monitors
_ first pass on full screen
_   exceptions in full screen mode will quit the app completely
_   (can't keep window open because things are hosed)
_   default is that full screen app doesn't cover multiple displays
_     this is fine since opengl can't usually go across both
_     but include an example for how to use full in gl 
_     (use toolkit.getscreensize)
_ cmd-q when running externally causes trouble because it quits
_   but when running internally it quits p5
_   how to shut off the cmd-q when running externally on osx?


CORE / PFont and text()

_ leading looks too big, at least in PGraphics2 with news gothic
_   though it may be the converted version of the .ttf?
_ font encoding issues 
_   java seems to force straight windows encoding.. (problem for pi fonts)
_   opentype/cff fonts don't work with live loading from the app
_   many (all?) opentype fonts won't show up or aren't supported
_     this may be only cff fonts that have trouble
_   when encoding is not the standard encoding, problematic
_     so sonata otf and sonata don't seem to have any chars at all
_ available font issues
_   is getFontList returning a different set of fonts from device2d?
_     try it out on java 1.3 versus 1.4
_   getAllFonts() not quite working for many fonts
_   i.e. Orator Std on windows.. macosx seems to be ok
_   is getFamilyNames() any different/better?
_   when did this break? 1.4.1? 1.4.x vs 1.3?
_   may be that cff fonts won't work?
_   or is it only those with ps names?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1117445969
_ createFont not working from applets
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1115877723;start=0
_ createFont() with a .ttf doesn't work in applets?
_   throws a security exception because of the reflection stuff
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1115877723;start=0
_ text() with a z coordinate is now using translate, very slow
X   also puts up a weird error message about translate() in 2D mode
_ make screen space fonts use get/set as well?
_   too much to debug on their own
_   unfortunately tint not set with setImpl, but...
_ optimize textMode(MODEL) with textMode(SCREEN)
_   in PGraphics and PGraphics3, check to see if matrix is within epsilon
_   of one of the rotation matrices (many fewer steps) 
_   if identity, or just translate, or a rotate, make OBJECT into SCREEN
_ not having kerning really blows
_   could this be pulled from the OpenType font stuff? 
_   it could be placed at the end of the file
_ not having fractional widths on small fonts really blows
_   screen space text looks crappy
_ working with vector fonts? 
_   need to be able to handle shapes within shapes (reverse winding)
_   ftgl: main code is in FTVectoriser
_   uses gluTessBeginContour and gluTessEndContour
_   and then does 5 step sizes for each curveto


CORE / PGraphics

_ alter bezier and curve matrices to use PMatrix
_   float array stuff is redundant with code that's in PMatrix
_   and PMatrix has to be included even w/o P3D so...
_ y2 position of rectangles not same as y2 position of lines
_   happens when the rectangle is flipped on the x or y axis
_   probably a hack that draws the "last" point differently
_ beginShape() 
_   don't allow you to draw stroked items unless stroke() is called
_   don't allow beginShape() if shape is already set
_     (otherwise will cause some very strange errors)
_ figure out a good model for adaptive sizing of circles
_   also goes for arcs, though will be weighted based on arc size
_ point appears to be broken
_   could be a problem with java 1.5? (was using win2k)
noStroke();
colorMode(RGB, 100);  
for(int i=0; i<100; i++) {  
  for(int j=0; j<100; j++) {  
    stroke(i, j, 0);  
    point(i, j);  
  }  
}  
As an aside, set() is at least 10x faster, and 
perhaps should be used in these examples anyway.

CORE / PGraphics2

_ make get/getImpl for PGraphics/PGraphics2
_   make sure there's a loadPixels/updatePixels in PGraphics2
_ slow on java2d, fast on p3d

_ set(x, y, image)
_   x, y not setting with processing
_ don't let users on < 1.3 load JAVA2D
_ set upper bound on framerate so as not to completely hose things?
_ fix the flicker in java2d mode
_   not clear what's happening here
_   appears to be much worse (unfinished drawing) on macosx
_     try turning off hw accel on the mac to see if that's the problem
_ textSpace(SCREEN_SPACE) needs to be faster
_   need flat image implementation that takes no transforms
_   along with 90, 180 and 270 versions of it as well
_   tie to glDrawPixels.. how to clear matrix properly for that?
_ catch sun.dc.pr.PRException?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=104
_ gradient-painted lines

CORE / PGraphics3

_ polygons perpendicular to axis not drawing
_   is this a clipping error?
_   probably a triangulation error, because triangles work ok
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=111
_ concave polygons having trouble if points come back to meet 
_   tesselator/triangulator gets confused when points doubled up
_   might need to avoid previous vertex hitting itself
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=97
_ P3D not doing bilinear interpolation in text and images 
_   because smooth() has to be set (and smooth throws an error in P3D)
_   how should this be handled? a hint? allowing smooth()?
_   probably just allow smooth() but don't smooth anything
_ ortho() is doing things strangely
_   seems to be mapping to 0, 0 - width/2, height/2

_ fix tint() for PGraphics3 (what could be wrong?)
_   tint() honoring alpha but not colored tint
_   maybe not setting fill color when drawing textures
_   guessing it's an implementation issue in sami's renderer
_   check with the a_Displaying example and tint(255, 0, 0, 100);
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=90
_ apply tint() to textures as well
_   otherwise no good way to color textures
_ Stroking a rect() leaves off the upper right pixel
_ make vertexCount etc properly accessible in PGraphics3
_   so that people can do things like the dxf renderer
_ error message saying that strokeCap and strokeJoin don't work
_ PPolygon no longer in use and PLine is a mess
_ also have a simple way to hook in triangle leeches to PGraphics3
_   this exists, but needs to be documented, or have accessors
_ add option to sort triangles back to front so alpha works

CORE / PSound

_ duration as an internal param, not a function
_ When a sound is finished playing, 
_   it should return to 0 so it can play again
_ Putting sound.loop() in draw() seemed to spawn multiple sounds threads?
_ After a sound is paused, it will only play from where it was paused
_   to its end and will not loop again
_ The ref in PSound2 says volume accepts vals from 0...1
_   but values larger than one increase the volume.
_ SoundEvent // is sound finished?? Can't access now. 
_ make java 1.1 version of PSound work properly
_ merge PSound and PSound2 via reflection?
_   once debugged, merge these back together and use reflection
_     (unless it's a messy disaster)
_ Unsupported control type: Master Gain 
_   what's actually causing this error?

_ gl smoothing.. how to disable polygon but keep line enabled
_   or at least make a note of this?
_   leave smooth off, get the gl object, then enable line smooth
_ ortho() behaving differently in P3D vs OPENGL
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=100

_ polygon z-order with alpha in opengl
_   at least add it to the faq, or this would be a test case w/ the sorting

_ fix non-bound textures from mangling everything else
_ fix enable/disable textures for some objects
_ fix endian ordering issues so that things work properly
_ figure out min/max texture sizes when binding to avoid problems
_   minimum texture size may be 64x64
_   might need to enforce it as a minimum
_ what should the update image function be called?
_ box and sphere are broken in gl
_ metaballs example dies when using box()
_   long string of exceptions, which are also missing their newlines
_ get loop, noLoop, redraw, and framerate all working in opengl
_   needs custom animator thread..
_ depth() shouldn't be needed for opengl unless actually 3D
_   right now the camera doesn't get set up unless you call depth()
_ resolve ARGB versus RGBA versus just A issues for fonts
_   make sure that current scenario works identically on mac
_   if so, just switch the image code to expect alpha in the high bits
_   fonts probably need to be RGBA, not ALPHA style images
_   there's nothing really ALPHA about them?
_ gl alpha on images when flipped around backwards
_   will sorting based on depth help this? also ask simon for ideas
_ rewrite getImpl/setImpl inside opengl
_ bit shifting in opengl, get down to 2 ops by using other image modes
_   i.e. ABGR_EXT might allow for just two shifts instead of 4
_ allow access to native pixel buffer in opengl and power of 2
_   so that no need to copy/update everything
_ need to write an error if people try to use opengl with 1.3 (i.e. on export)

_ illustrator export / rendering mode
_   also postscript or pdf export?
_   update illustrator code to use core api
_     even if not actually working properly.. just in naming of things
_   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
_   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
_     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
o   version of BApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.
