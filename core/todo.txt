0070 bagel
o check ordering of split() in java vs perl for regexp
X don't include empty chars in font builder
X   .vlw font files are enormous with full charset
X   check to see if the character exists before adding it to the font
X fixed (unreported) problem with char lookup code
o split() with multiple args (i think this is completed)
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1078985667
X trim() not chop().. whups
X random(5, 5) -> return 5, random(6, 4) return error
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083275855;start=0
X use random.nextFloat() because it's faster
X make grayscale image in p5
X   could be used with alpha() to properly set alpha values
X   made into filter(GRAYSCALE) and filter(BLACK_WHITE) functions
X make g.depthTest settable as a hint
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1078428462;start=0
X #ifdef to remove client and server code as well
X need to resolve issues between rendering screen/file
X   illustrator-based rendering needs to work for ars projects
X   screen may be 400x400 pixels, but file be 36x36"
X launcher.cpp broke serial.. see versions in processing.notcvs
X rewrite bagel code.. 
X   for this release, because it will break things along with the lib stuff
X   switch to PImage, PApplet, etc
X selecting input source (wintv board and quickcam installed.. problem)
X bug in BImage.smooth() when resizing an image
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1077669847

video
X video commands not color coded

o quicktime 6.4 update breaks p5 on the mac?
o   http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=93414&sessionID=anonymous%7C26893096&kbhost=kbase.info.apple.com%3a80%2f

o   http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=120255
X split classes to BVideo and BMovie ? 
X don't force install of qtjava
X   this requires a separate version of bagel that doesn't use video
X   or a version that loads video dynamically. that kinda sucks.
o   maybe could even compile it in with jikes? (blech)
o hangs frequently on the mac (prolly a sync issue)
o   karsten's stuff has same problem
o   but the roger's video tracking does not
X   should be fixed with new synchronization stuff
X video.pixels don't seem to have high bytes set
X   so fill(video.pixels[blah]) doesn't work
X   test against 'pixels' example
X   this is ok.. modify get() for RGB images to set high bits
X make BVideo subclass BImage
o   make sure the high bits are getting set as opaque
X   get() now sets high bits, reference will explain PVideo.pixels[]
X video keeps running, cpu load high, even after app killed
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1086800853
X just locks up after running examples, then does the 'can't delete' thing
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1060313779
X problems with hanging video when not in the root of the c drive
X   is this because of the LIBRARY_PATH having spaces?
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1084464062;start=0
X first row of video pixels are black
X   casey says it may only be his camera (verified to be ok on my machine)

_   until you quit the processing running the server
_   (the server starts and stops fine)
_ add constants for building NET, move stuff around in bagel dir
_ some method for just downloading the entire contents of a url
_ add udp support


thesis / acg
_ make bagel more usable as standalone
_   breakout BGraphics (have its own BImage)
_   breakout BApplet into BComponent ? (fix out-of-bounds mouse)
_   possible use of BUtils ?
_   write documentation on general use
_     along with how to download from sourceforge (anonpass is blank)
_   needs to be used as a component, without applet 
_   but retain functionality, ie. image i/o
_   exports pixels or a BImage or does MemoryImageSource itself
_   move math functions into utility library associated
_     with bagel, because those will be useful on other bagel platforms
_     pApplet will call BagelMath.whatever, so still looks like cos()
_ break out BSerial as separate object like BVideo
_   include rxtx and the rest of that setup in subfolder
_   BSerial.flush and BSerial.available in object
_ opengl export / rendering mode
_   currently implemented, but somewhat broken
_   finish this once all the line code is done
_ make possible to use buzz.pl to create versions w/ stuff removed
_ build gl4java for java 1.4
_ read table/csv formatted data into a matrix
_   pseudo-database format version of this that stores indexes to file
_     rather than loading the whole thing at once
_ more advanced splitting of files into rows/cols uses another class
_   other class also has concept for random access of lines
_   by storing the line positions, can access without loading all
_   into memory because some files will be too large
_ illustrator export / rendering mode
_   also postscript or pdf export?
_   version of Illustrator.java that uses bagel api
_   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
_   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
_     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
_   version of BApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.
_ history.. add my diffs sketch
_   could just include a compiled version of the diff app, ala jikes


NEW GRAPHICS
_ stroke not set on flat_rect
_ when drawing fonts w/ sami's code, left edge has problem
_   8-bit (alpha) textures not blending 
_ near-plane clipping currently disabled for triangles, enabled for lines
_   (but culling offscreen triangles works.. but may have been
_   commented out by carlos)
_ sphere code needs only front face polygon 
_   all triangles must be counter-clockwise (front-facing)


_ some way to properly quit sketch when stopped
_   if people have other threads they've spawned, impossible to stop
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1067383998
_ update() mode needs to be hacked in
_ separating of BGraphics and BApplet
_ change copyrights on the files again (to match ?)
_ proper lineweight
_ camera clipping
_ put screenshots into their sketch folder
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1046185738;start=0
_   add a method BApplet.setPath() or something like that
_ update illustrator code to use bagel api
_   even if not actually working properly.. just in naming of things
_ new networking client from simong 
_ simong lighting code
_ screenGrab() at the end of a draw mode program is problematic
_   app might exit before the file has finished writing to disk
_   need to block other activity inside screenGrab until finished
_ catch security exceptions around applet i/o calls
_   not just for saving files, but provide better error msgs when
_     attempting to download from another server

GRAPHICS LIBRARY

A hybrid of OpenGL (3D Graphics) and some aspects of Postscript (Fill, Stroke)
The graphics library is called Bagel, which is an internal name.


BAGEL / Rendering

   b _ picking
   b _   what is the API for picking?
   b _   ability to write data other than image into the buffer
   b _   user can introduce new kinds of buffers at will (!)
   b _   lists of names of objects, or the 'line number' buffer
   b _   but how to determine *where* on object the hit occurs

     _ add option to sort triangles back to front so alpha works
     _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1076660476;start=0

   b _ lines
   b X   rewrite line and stroke code, it's a buggy mess
   b X     lines become 2 pixels thick after a 3D transform 
   b X     better handling of single-pixel special   se
   b _       flat_line_retribution is a hack, can go away
   b ?   make sure line() commands don't try to have a fill
   b _   box is not opaque
   b X     problem is that lines are drawn second
   b X     one pixel lines have no z value.. argh
   b X     bug re: 3d depth sorting on lines
   b _     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1043894019;start=0

   b _     translate(58, 48, 0); 
   b _     rotateY(0.5);
   b _     box(40);
   b _   line endcaps and line joins. strokeMode()
   b _     lower priority, but at least leave room
   b _ strokeWeight is still broken
   b _   setting stroke width on circle makes odd patterns
   b _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1077013848;start=0
   b _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1080347160

   b _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1042699742
   b X   NullPointerException apparently when things way offscreen
   b _     i.e. glyphrot with scale set to 4
   b _     or at least that things get ridiculously slow
   b _     clipping issues here.. but also something in scan converter
   b X     not clipping areas from offscreen
   b _       huge geometry slows things way down



BAGEL / Details

   1 _ toxi ellipses don't adapt properly with transformations
   1 _ what is the stroked version of a sphere? a circle?
   1 _ non-homogenous coloring for curve vertices
   1 _   properly interpolate
   1 _ too many push() will silently stop the applet inside a loop
   1 _ test winding polygons in different directions
   1 _ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
   1 _ better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
   1 _ is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
   1 _   may be correct, it worked for nik
   1 _ inside draw() mode, delay() does nothing
   1 _   delay might be a good way to signal drawing to the screen/updating


BAGEL / Fonts

   1 _ sbit font support
   1 _   both reading and building sbit fonts
   * _ mac -> vlw (or sbit?) font converter
   * _   need to also read the fond for metrics
