o   seen especially on old mac laptops (slow ppc garbage) 
o   can this be confirmed properly?

o an offscreen JAVA2D graphics needs loadPixels() before being drawn
o   i.e. offscreen JAVA2D, then image() with OPENGL renderer as main
o   needs to be marked as its cache needs an update, but not its pixels
X begin/endPixels.. change has been made
o   on PImage, sets a flag that marks it to be updated on next render
o   for PImage, begin after an end is ignored, no pixels are re-loaded
o     the "changed" bit gets turned off when the PImage is rendered
o   for subclasses of PGraphics, the reload bit needs to be set on endFrame
o   filter() checks to see if inside begin/endPixels, if so doesn't call
o   if line() is called inside beginpixels, call updatepixels?
o   when NPE on line with pixels[], suggest user includes beginPixels
o need to test/straighten out load/update pixels
o   loadPixels() and updatePixels() only need to be used when 
o   touching pixels[]. All other functions including get(), set(),
o   filter(), etc shouldn't need them. 
o image memory use.. how to handle lots of images
o   need to figure out exactly how they should/can unload
o don't do a loadPixels unless an updatePixels has completed
o   tho this won't affect anything, since either it's an image buffer
o   or it's the PGraphics object, which does an updatePixels() immediately
o if (modified) don't loadPixels again, just ignore it
o   make a note that updatePixels() only sets a flag in PImage
o     (but not PGraphics, which does it immediately)
o smoothing
o   how to handle smoothing images in P3D even though it has no smoothing?
o   noSmooth() in opengl should switch to nearest neighbor on textures/images
o   same for P3D
o P3D smooshes the top row of pixels when drawing text (or images)

o   NullPointerException apparently when things way offscreen
o     i.e. glyphrot with scale set to 4
o     or at least that things get ridiculously slow
o     clipping issues here.. but also something in scan converter
o     not clipping areas from offscreen
o       huge geometry slows things way down
o STROKE_WEIGHT field in PGraphics3 is a disaster, because it's an int
o   use the SW from vertex instead.. why set stroke in triangle vars at all?
o   currently truncating to an int inside add_line_no_clip
o   need to clean all this crap up
o switch to glWindowPos() instead of glRasterPos() silliness
o get rid of some of the sillier IntBuffer stuff where it's not needed
o   use the version of the prototypes that use an offset into the array
o   need to test performance either way
o make a note about the anti-aliasing types in the faq
o   polygon vs line etc.. may want to enable lines but disable polys
o invocationtargetexception in gl with aioobe:
o   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1115185737
o resolve ARGB versus RGBA versus just A issues for fonts
o   make sure that current scenario works identically on mac
o   if so, just switch the image code to expect alpha in the high bits
o   fonts probably need to be RGBA, not ALPHA style images
o   there's nothing really ALPHA about them?
o bit shifting in opengl, get down to 2 ops by using other image modes
o   i.e. ABGR_EXT might allow for just two shifts instead of 4
o allow access to native pixel buffer in opengl and power of 2
o   so that no need to copy/update everything
o how to handle gluTessVertex calls
o   need to re-map through the regular "vertex" command, 
o   but that makes things messy because the glu calls make calls to vertex()
o   and i don't want an additional "pathVertex()" function
o with opengl optimizations via call lists..
o   watch out to make sure raw recording still works
o   (optimizations will have to be disabled to some extent)
o look into using glu quadrics to handle shape geometries quickly
o optimizations to opengl
o   disabling error reporting (what's taking it so long?)
o     maybe use a hint() to enable it? or a getError() function?
o   make cached display list of filled/non-filled ellipse.. rect.. etc
o     these don't work when the vertex colors change, but..
o   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=657
o   or maybe should be using vertex arrays?
o maybe break out a separate timage object in textures?
o   needs tindex and tbuffer, both gl specific
o     and for tpixels and twidth/theight, could use another PImage
o   under assumption that most will just need an extra image object
o   this could also be used by people eventually to control tex themselves
o   or maybe call the object "texture"?
o   in opengl lib, need beginTexture(PImage) and endTexture()
o   this will be helpful to have access to the raw texture data
o   that way it can be re-bound by itself, and ppl can write directly to it
o make textMode(SHAPE) faster in opengl
o   cache for type should be per-renderer
o   make the opengl textmode shape stuff get better and use PShape
o   because opengl needs vectors, but also the image cache for textures

X cursor functions don't work in present mode

o when drawing an image, sense whether drawn rotated
o   specifically, if drawn rotated 90 in either direction, or 180
o   if just rotate/translate, then can use SCREEN_SPACE for fonts
o "Target VM failed to initialize" when using Present mode on Mac OS X
o   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=178

decisions
o call reapplySettings() when using beginRecord()?
X   nope, won't work for many fonts, can't get the background
X   should beginRecord inherit settings from its parent renderer?
X     textFont() is null on beginRecord
X     same would be the case for strokeWeight, background, etc.
X   add note to begin/endRecord, that settings are not inherited
X     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=346
o     or actually inherit the settings
X   decision: too many minor glitches possible, just note in the ref
X     i.e. some fonts don't work with PDF, or bg color can't be re-set
X clean up filter stuff?
X   filter(GRAY) -> to push things to luminosity-based gray
X     already implemented this way
o   filter(MASK, ...) -> or ALPHA? 
o   filter(TINT, tintColor)
X   decision: use luminosity for gray
X   decision: tinting is usually for a dynamic thing, so not necessary
o change default save() to use PNG instead of TIFF (speed?)
o   decision: due to speed, just keep it as TIFF
o clipping
o   http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/experiments/borg/render/index.html
o   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clip_Mapping
o   http://www.cubic.org/docs/3dclip.htm
o perspective() applied after camera()... problems?
o make sure that filter, blend, copy, etc say that no loadPixels necessary
o add java.io.Reader (and Writer?) to imports
X binary() auto-sizes, hex() does not
X   decision: remove auto-sizing from binary
X remove delay()
X   if you really want it, you can use Thread.sleep()
X thread() and method()
X   thread() method (web workers?)
X   decision: add thread, method isn't great
X   oops: method() is just used by thread
X PImage.save() should return a success boolean
X   and not throw an exception when it fails
o cmyk version of tiff encoder code?
o illustrator export / rendering mode
o   also postscript or pdf export?
o   update illustrator code to use core api
o     even if not actually working properly.. just in naming of things
o   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
o   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
o     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
o cairo tesselation used: 
o   John Hobby, Practical Segment Intersection with Finite Precision Output. 
o   Computational Geometry Theory and Application, 13(4), 1999.
o   http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/hobby93practical.html
o textMode(SHAPE) and textMode(IMAGE)?
o   textMode(SCREEN) is out of its league?
o textMode(SHAPE) and hint(SMOOTHING) calls are really awkward
o   maybe need to add properties to the size() command?
o   or use a getXxxx() method?
o in PShape, getChild(name) refers to a <blah id="name">
o   however in an XML file, that's <name ...>, meaning the name of the tag
o   change it to getShape(name)? also for fonts getShape(char c)
o   decision: use getShape() (maybe add getShapeCount and getShape(int)) 
o     and remove getChild() from PShape
o   oops: getParent() is in there, as is getChildren() and others...
o   svg examples should use getShape(name) not getChild(name)
X   better to not break the naming, since getParent() needs to stay
X   nobody felt strongly enough about getShape()
X   so better to not change (and start breaking things)

xml changes
o see if write() is necessary inside PNodeXML
o   it needs a proper header on it, so maybe that's the difference w/ toString()
o inefficient: the way new nodes are created
o also inefficient: adding/removing kids just nukes the children array
X toString() adds the XML header
X move to new XML library
X   add XHTML parsing or any others?
X   html parser? javax.swing.text.html.parser... has binary DTDs
X   decision: it's someone else's job
X XMLElemnt.parse() or new XMLElement(xmldata)?
X   same goes for PShape.. parse from a string?

stop() mess
_ destroy() shouldn't call exit()... change from lonnen
_   calls ((PApplet)this).exit() instead of stop() (since stop is pause)
_ notes
_   exit() should do the actual exit
_   if inside draw, let it finish the loop
_   if not looping, need to do it immediately
_   does stop() unwind the thread, or does the thread unwind call stop?

CORE / PApplet

_ PApplet.main(new String[] { "classname" }) won't pass in args
_   this means that no args are after passed to the class
_   the fix would be to use the following as the call to main()
_   PApplet.main(append(new String[] { "classname }, args));
_ detect when using full screen
_   and if so, remove decoration and don't bother with bg present frame
_   frame.setUndecorated(true);
_   frame.setLocation(0,0);
_   size(screen.width,screen,height); 
_   this will help for exported applets that don't need 'present'
_ check for what else inside PApplet should be static
_   maybe catch RuntimeExceptions in the called sub-functions
_   that way more stuff can be static w/o losing useful error handling
_   (emitting errors when closest to source.. i.e. w/ the filename)
o size() inside draw is missing a new call to cameraMode, etc
_ fix param() to use a sketch.properties file when run as an app
_   make this also be used in generating the html file
_ test winding polygons in different directions
_ loadBytes() needs optimization
_   don't bother using a buffering stream, just handle internally. gah!


CORE / PApplet - main()

_ implement full screen mode.. this takes over the screen as best it can
_   size(screen.width, screen.height, OPENGL);
_   if size is screen.width and screen.height, does its best
_   needs to get the size of the main screen
_   this probably works but just needs to be tested
_   exceptions in full screen mode will quit the app completely
_     can't keep window open because things are hosed
_   default is that full screen app doesn't cover multiple displays
_     this is fine since opengl can't usually go across both
_     but include an example for how to use full in gl 
_ ability to select monitor via preferences panel
_   this applies to any applet that's run externally currently (verify)
_   make it also work with anything that's run inside of p5 itself
_     this means changing the frame creation code inside Runner
_   check current present code with multiple monitors
_ hitting cmd-q when an applet is running quits p5 (on macosx)
_   but cmd-q when running externally is ok because it just quits
_   is there a way to catch cmd-q when running a sketch? 
_     so that it could avoid quitting if the sketch hasn't been stopped
_     or if the sketch window is foremost
_     maybe a hack where a new menubar is added? 
_ --display not working on osx
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=71


CORE / PFont and text()

_ what's the difference with ascent on loadFont vs. createFont?
_ svg font support seems nice.. add PFontSVG
_ font rotation (native font problem?) with natives?
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=692
_ text position is quantized in JAVA2D
_   text placement is ugly, seems like fractional metrics problem
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=99
_ text(char c) with char 0 and undefined should print nothing
_   perhaps also DEL or other nonprintables?
_   book example 25-03
_ accessors inside PFont need a lot of work
_ improve font metrics
_   http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/reference/faqs/index.html#Q_How_do_I_obtain_font_metrics
_ font encoding issues 
_   java seems to force straight windows encoding.. (problem for pi fonts)
_   opentype/cff fonts don't work with live loading from the app
_   many (all?) opentype fonts won't show up or aren't supported
_     this may be only cff fonts that have trouble
_   when encoding is not the standard encoding, problematic
_     so sonata otf and sonata don't seem to have any chars at all
_ text() with a z coordinate is now using translate, very slow
X   also puts up a weird error message about translate() in 2D mode
_ make screen space fonts use get/set as well?
_   too much to debug on their own
_   unfortunately tint not set with setImpl, but...
_ optimize textMode(MODEL) with textMode(SCREEN)
_   in PGraphics and PGraphics3, check to see if matrix is within epsilon
_   of one of the rotation matrices (many fewer steps) 
_   if identity, or just translate, or a rotate, make OBJECT into SCREEN
_ not having kerning really blows
_   could this be pulled from the OpenType font stuff? 
_   it could be placed at the end of the file
_ not having fractional widths on small fonts really blows
_   screen space text looks crappy
_ working with vector fonts? 
_   need to be able to handle shapes within shapes (reverse winding)
_   ftgl: main code is in FTVectoriser
_   uses gluTessBeginContour and gluTessEndContour
_   and then does 5 step sizes for each curveto
_ show an error when using a font character that isn't available
_   maybe fall back on other characters instead?


CORE / PGraphics

_ y2 position of rectangles not same as y2 position of lines
_   happens when the rectangle is flipped on the x or y axis
_   probably a hack that draws the "last" point differently

_ lines
_   z value hack for lines is causing trouble for 2D
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1089737928;start=0
_   rewrite line and stroke code, it's a buggy mess
_     lines become 2 pixels thick after a 3D transform 
_     better handling of single-pixel special case
_       flat_line_retribution is a hack, can go away

_   need flat image implementation that takes no transforms
_   along with 90, 180 and 270 versions of it as well
_   tie to glDrawPixels.. how to clear matrix properly for that?
_   maybe just disable this for JAVA2D cuz it's silly?
_ catch sun.dc.pr.PRException?
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=39


CORE / PGraphics3D

_ box is not opaque
_   problem is that lines are drawn second

CORE / PImage

_ make loading images lighter, ala android 
_   require loadPixels to get 2D image data from images
_   only load PImage pixels when necessary (faster for java2d)
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=60
_ loadImage() should use the faster loading methods
_   hint(DISABLE_IMAGE_CACHING)
_   add a note to the loadImage() reference page
_ figure out why 1024x768 image takes 3.5 seconds to load
_   would using a BufferedImage work better?
_   is the image actually a BufferedImage so PixelGrabber is a waste?
_ work through loadPixels in PImage, how consistent do we need to be?
_   with get() and set() methods, this gets really tricky (too slow)
_   could optimize by keeping a java image around, but table for later
_     it's too significant a change, and not enough time to test
_ callback for requestImage()
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=641

_ for a PGraphics2D, should its image cache object be the memoryimagesource?
_ loading lots of images is a problem, describe how to unload
_   is it possible? necessary to call delay(5) or something?
_ don't grab pixels of java2d images unless asked
_   this is the difference between a lot of loadPixels() and not
_   so important to have it in before beta if that's the change
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=60
_ add ability to control jpeg compression level with save() and saveFrame()
_   or just write a better example for this one?

_ support for text (shouldn't be too bad, use createFont)
_   implement text spans for svg output
_ try enabling blending modes
_ add better support for attributes buried in styles (support ai9/10/11)
_ test what happens when transparency is used with gradient fill
_ look into transformation issues... guessing this is probably wrong
_   this may be what's throwing off the radial radius transform
_ implement A and a (elliptical arcs)
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=130
_ check for any other pieces of missing path api
_   multiple sets of coordinates after a command not supported
_   i.e. M with several coords means moveto followed by many linetos
_   also curveto with multiple sets of points is ignored
_ document somehow.. svg viewer will be discontinued

_ pdf sketches exiting before writing has finished
_   people have to call exit() (so that dispose() is called in particular)
_ when using noLoop() and the PDF renderer, sketch should exit gracefully
_   because isDisplayable() returns false, there's no coming back from noLoop

LATER / Optimize

_ put a wrapper around InputStream returned by createInput
_   that actually has some notion of the length of its input
_   that way, methods could use the information when reading
_ can loadBytes() be improved by querying file size first?
_   background 
_     this would require a new version of createInput(), which would query
_     the URL (or file) for an actual file size. the size is not always
_     available, so it can't be relied upon, but would help in some cases.
_   loadBytes() is used for images.. ouch
_   might be worth doing a test to see if it actually would help at all 
_     before rewriting all of createInput()
_ too much object creation in java2d
_   causes inconsistency/hiccups as the gc runs?


LATER (post 2.0)

_ add shader support
_ createColor() instead of color()?
_ route all exceptions through PException and catch method
_   advanced users can override the method if they want
_   or you can set an option to have PExceptions be raised
_   decision: just copy & paste the serial/net code.. 
_     until we can find a more compelling example
_ actual shape api for things like rectangles and whatnot?
_ should we kill import xxxx syntax for libraries? 
_   just give up and use a gui for it
_   cons: copy & paste breaks
_   pro: there's no guaranteed 1:1 between packages and single libraries
_ method of threading but queue an event to be run when safe
_   e.g. queueing items like mouse/keybd, but generic fxns
_ for begin/endRecord, use a piggyback mechanism
_   that way won't have to pass a PApplet around
_   this has a big impact on the SVG library
_   in fact, this maybe should be a library that does it
_     so that the file size can be much smaller
_ add setOutput() method across other renderers?
_ opengl.jar with eclipse
_   auto-extract native libs from opengl.jar 
_   to remove java.library.path problems (!)
_ introduce calc()
_   semantics of this are just too tricky, especially when it's not clear
_   what's actually gained by the split--would have to do weird hacks
_   to get the accum buffer, etc. to work anyway
_ add some sort of unprojectX/Y/Z method (based on glu fxn)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=OpenGL;action=display;num=1176483247
_ add a timer(obj, "functionname", 45) method
_   this can be used to schedule something to happen at a specific time
_   or import the swing timer (for actionPerformed)
_   also add interval("functionname", 40)
_ color(0, 0, 0, 0) produces black
_   because color(0, 0, 0, 0) creates an int that is simply '0'

_   also, rgb255 not getting set
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382
_ should fill(c) instead be fillColor(c)?
_ should color(123, 4, 99) instead be createColor()?
_ rounding errors on color conversion
_   colorMode(RGB, 1.0); colorMode(255); println(red(color(0.5,1,1)));
