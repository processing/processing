X   casey: i wan't able to get binary() to work at all:
o Typography: Helix won't compile 
o   works fine, just needs BFont -> PFont
X standalone 'alpha' function for PImage (static methods for alpha fxns)
X Image: Edge, Image: Blur: Alpha not set? The error is easier to see on Blur
X   turns out bounds checking wasn't working properly on colors

040913
X printarr instead of print/println for arrays
X   println(Object o) conflicts with println(int a[])
X   but println(Object o) is very needed

_ massive graphics engine changes
_   explicitly state depth()/nodepth()
_   move to new graphics engine
_     test with rgb cube, shut off smoothing
_   make sure line artifacts are because of smoothing
_   implement 2x oversampling for anti-aliasing

_ api for file-based renderers
_   need to work this out since it will affect other api changes
_   size(0, 0) and then ai.size(10000, 20000)
_     size 0 is code for internal to not show any window
_   saveFrame(PRenderer) or saveFrame("name", PRenderer)
_   saveFrame gets called at the beginning of loop()
_     or is just a message to save the next frame (problem for anim)
_ illustrator export / rendering mode
_   also postscript or pdf export?
_   update illustrator code to use core api
_     even if not actually working properly.. just in naming of things
_   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
_   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
_     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
_   version of BApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.
