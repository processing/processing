X textureMode(NORMAL_SPACE)  screws up the image() command
X   image() appears to require IMAGE_SPACE to function properly. 
X added focusGained() and focusLost()
_   add to preprocessor
X lots of changes to internal naming of vars
X beginShape() defaults to beginShape(POLYGON)
_   needs to be noted for the reference
X screenX(x, y) and screenY(x, y) added for noDepth()

_ image loading bug is huge

_ pmouseX is broken again
_   maintain things a bit different

_ need timer in as part of the api
_   or at least include an example that uses it

_ beginFrame() around setup()
_   draw mode stuff happens inside setup.. 
_   or maybe need to get better at size() inside of draw() ? 

_ depth testing of lines vs text is problematic
_   probably need to patch in an older version of the line code
_   use depth()/noDepth() to handle depth test

_ y2 position of rectangles not same as y2 position of lines
_   happens when the rectangle is flipped on the x or y axis
_   probably a hack that draws the "last" point differently

_ fishwick bug with text() and shapes
_   ellipses no longer completed when g.dimensions = 2 or 3,
_   or not even drawn.. what a mess.

_ only allocate stencil and zbuffer on first call to depth()
_   this will require changes to PTriangle and PLine inside their loops

_ add TRIANGLE_FAN

_ break apart functions into local (placement) and override (blitting)
_   just have a "thin_flat_line" option in opengl code

_ image("blah.jpg"); 
_ loadImage() is broken on some machines
_   hacked for a fix in 72, but need to better coordinate with openStream()

_ uv coords > 1 shouldn't clamp, they should just repeat ala opengl
_   actually i think opengl has a setting for it

_ renderers can plug in:
_   at direct api level
_     taking over all color() functions and vertex collection
_   at endShape() level
_     where vertices are collected by core and blit on endShape()
_     (takes polygons and lines)
_   at post tesselation level
_     takes only line segments and triangles to blit (dxf writer)

_ vertices max out at 512.. make it grow

_ getAllFonts() not quite working for many fonts
_   i.e. Orator Std on windows.. macosx seems to be ok
_   is getFamilyNames() any different/better?
_   when did this break? 1.4.1? 1.4.x vs 1.3?

_ go through and figure out what stuff to make public

_ screenX/Y aren't properly working for 2D points against a 3D matrix
_   (ryan alexander rounding bug)
_   Just to clarify, it works completely correctly with rounding
_   screenX/Y and also using the 3 arg version of translate - 
_   ie translate(hw,hh,0) instead of just translate(hw,hh). 

text issues
_ textMode ALIGN_CENTER _LEFT _RIGHT -> CENTER, LEFT, RIGHT ? 
_ need to resolve SCREEN_SPACE vs OBJECT_SPACE
_   can this be auto-detected with noDepth()? 
_   how does rotated text work?
_     PFont.rotate(180) rotate(PI)
_     or can this be detected from the matrix?
_   does the font or PApplet control the size? (the font, ala java)
_   without setting the font, SCREEN_SPACE comes out weird
_   move SCREEN_SPACE into ScreenFont() class?
_     probably not, casey thinks screen space text is prolly more useful
_     that way can clear up some of the general confusion in the code
_   check into symbol font encoding with create font

text wish list
_ look into fixing the texture mapping to not squash fonts
_   NEW_GRAPHICS totally smashes everything
_ not having kerning really blows
_   could this be pulled from the OpenType font stuff? 
_   it could be placed at the end of the file
_ simple way to just use java text in p5 applets? 
_   the current text support is just so hokey

_ before graphics engine change, attach jogl stuff
_   need to try jogl to make sure no further changes
_   and the illustrator stuff
_ 404 error because first searches applet directory on zipdecode
_ image(String name) and textFont(String name)
_   do we change to font(arial, 12) ?

_ write PApplet2, a full screen version of PApplet
_   this might be used for presentation mode

_ massive graphics engine changes
_   explicitly state depth()/nodepth()
_   move to new graphics engine
_     test with rgb cube, shut off smoothing
_   make sure line artifacts are because of smoothing
_   implement 2x oversampling for anti-aliasing

_ api for file-based renderers
_   need to work this out since it will affect other api changes
_   size(0, 0) and then ai.size(10000, 20000)
_     size 0 is code for internal to not show any window
_   saveFrame(PRenderer) or saveFrame("name", PRenderer)
_   saveFrame gets called at the beginning of loop()
_     or is just a message to save the next frame (problem for anim)
_ illustrator export / rendering mode
_   also postscript or pdf export?
_   update illustrator code to use core api
_     even if not actually working properly.. just in naming of things
_   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
_   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
_     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
_   version of BApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.

_ figure out how to handle cached images, multiple images
_   MediaTracker blocking is prolly making jar download really slow
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1089914280;start=0

_ mkoser wish list
_   filled polygons working with smooth()
_   z-clipping

_ light(x, y, z, c1, c2, c3, TYPE)
_   also BLight with same constructor, and on() and off() fxn

CORE / Details

   1 _ framerate(30) is still flickery and jumpy..

   1 _ non-homogenous coloring for curve vertices
   1 _   properly interpolate
   1 _ too many push() will silently stop the applet inside a loop
   1 _ test winding polygons in different directions
   1 _ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
   1 _ better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
   1 _ is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
   1 _   may be correct, it worked for nik
   1 _ inside draw() mode, delay() does nothing
   1 _   delay might be a good way to signal drawing to the screen/updating
   1 _ catch security exceptions around applet i/o calls
   1 _   not just for saving files, but provide better error msgs when
   1 _     attempting to download from another server
   1 _ array utilities on Object[] are worthless.. fix it with reflection?
   1 _   see if reflection will allow expand for all class types
