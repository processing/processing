o moviemaker built into core to write uncompressed frames? or PNG?
X   doing this via a tool instead
X on resize, call redraw() when noLoop() is used
o   need to add this to the docs
X   was already in the documentation..
o add inputPath()
X   remove inputPath()

_ add inputPath() and outputPath() -> sketch folder or sd card

_ finish adding loadStrings(BufferedReader)
_   decide if we want to keep this (and/or others?)
_   port to android

_ change how beginRecord() works.. passing around PApplet vs PGraphics is gross
_   have to pass PApplet just to make the rendering work to both renderers
_   should instead be a renderer that splits things out

sort out full screen issues
_ boolean sketchFullscreen() ? 
_   for more options, just integrate the fs library?
_   let hansi know when it's integrated so he can update his library
_   casey: I think we only want to most basic functionality, to go full screen across monitors.
_   http://www.superduper.org/processing/fullscreen_api/
_   https://github.com/kritzikratzi/jAppleMenuBar/blob/master/src/native/jAppleMenuBar.m
_ detect when using full screen
_   and if so, remove decoration and don't bother with bg present frame
_   frame.setUndecorated(true);
_   frame.setLocation(0,0);
_   size(screen.width,screen,height); 
_   this will help for exported applets that don't need 'present'
_ add option to use full screen exclusive mode on present inside pde?
_   override default setting of macosx (yes) and linux/win (no)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1043
_   linux present mode isn't working properly

_ if save() returns boolean, does saveFrame()?
_   also need to copy this over to android

_ enable smooth() by default
_   better to learn noSmooth() later
_   disable smoothing on noSmooth(), use hint to do 2x vs 4x smoothing
_ document how things are sometimes null in XML
_   test xml examples to see if they break

_ add resize().. make it call setSize().
_   also needs to do a redraw if noLoop() has been called

_ trimming text on URLs?

_   or have an alternate version that does that?
_ decide whether to keep:
_   public float textWidth(char[] chars, int start, int length)
_ add version of math functions that use doubles?
_   what other methods should work with doubles? all math functions?
_   seems like internal (mostly static) things, but not graphics api
_ add shuffle methods for arrays
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=229
_ don't allow things inside begin/endShape() that aren't possible
_   better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
_   don't allow you to draw stroked items unless stroke() is called
_   don't allow beginShape() if shape is already set

stop() mess
_ sort out destroy(), stop(), pause() et al
_   ColorSelector should stop/pause when not visible
_   start()/stop() perform like onPause()/onResume()
_     all of which call pause() and resume()
_ destroy() shouldn't call exit()... change from lonnen
_   calls ((PApplet)this).exit() instead of stop() (since stop is pause)
_ notes
_   exit() should do the actual exit
_   if inside draw, let it finish the loop
_   if not looping, need to do it immediately
_   does stop() unwind the thread, or does the thread unwind call stop?
_   browser will call start() and stop() methods
_ need to figure out start/stop signals coming from the browser
_   is it dispose/destroy? 
_ stop() not getting called

_   need to track this stuff down a bit
_ when closing a sketch via the close box, make sure stop() getting called
X   found a problem for release 0133
_   test to see if it's working
_ what's up with stop() vs exit()?
_   need to get this straightened for p5 (i.e. bc has this problem)
_   make sure the main() doesn't exit until the applet has finished
_   i.e. problem with main calling itself multiple times in Alpheus
_   if exit() (or stop) is called, then System.exit() gets called,
_   even though the main() wants to keep going
_ hitting ESC in a running noLoop()ed sketch won't close the sketch?

CORE / PApplet

_ PApplet.main(new String[] { "classname" }) won't pass in args
_   this means that no args are after passed to the class
_   the fix would be to use the following as the call to main()
_   PApplet.main(append(new String[] { "classname }, args));
_ check for what else inside PApplet should be static
_   maybe catch RuntimeExceptions in the called sub-functions
_   that way more stuff can be static w/o losing useful error handling
_   (emitting errors when closest to source.. i.e. w/ the filename)
o size() inside draw is missing a new call to cameraMode, etc
_ fix param() to use a sketch.properties file when run as an app
_   make this also be used in generating the html file
_ test winding polygons in different directions
_ loadBytes() needs optimization
_   don't bother using a buffering stream, just handle internally. gah!


CORE / PApplet - main()

_ implement full screen mode.. this takes over the screen as best it can
_   size(screen.width, screen.height, OPENGL);
_   if size is screen.width and screen.height, does its best
_   needs to get the size of the main screen
_   this probably works but just needs to be tested
_   exceptions in full screen mode will quit the app completely
_     can't keep window open because things are hosed
_   default is that full screen app doesn't cover multiple displays
_     this is fine since opengl can't usually go across both
_     but include an example for how to use full in gl 
_ ability to select monitor via preferences panel
_   this applies to any applet that's run externally currently (verify)
_   make it also work with anything that's run inside of p5 itself
_     this means changing the frame creation code inside Runner
_   check current present code with multiple monitors
_ hitting cmd-q when an applet is running quits p5 (on macosx)
_   but cmd-q when running externally is ok because it just quits
_   is there a way to catch cmd-q when running a sketch? 
_     so that it could avoid quitting if the sketch hasn't been stopped
_     or if the sketch window is foremost
_     maybe a hack where a new menubar is added? 
_ --display not working on osx
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=71


CORE / PFont and text()

_ what's the difference with ascent on loadFont vs. createFont?
_ svg font support seems nice.. add PFontSVG
_ font rotation (native font problem?) with natives?
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=692
_ text position is quantized in JAVA2D
_   text placement is ugly, seems like fractional metrics problem
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=99
_ text(char c) with char 0 and undefined should print nothing
_   perhaps also DEL or other nonprintables?
_   book example 25-03
_ accessors inside PFont need a lot of work
_ improve font metrics
_   http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/reference/faqs/index.html#Q_How_do_I_obtain_font_metrics
_ font encoding issues 
_   java seems to force straight windows encoding.. (problem for pi fonts)
_   opentype/cff fonts don't work with live loading from the app
_   many (all?) opentype fonts won't show up or aren't supported
_     this may be only cff fonts that have trouble
_   when encoding is not the standard encoding, problematic
_     so sonata otf and sonata don't seem to have any chars at all
_ text() with a z coordinate is now using translate, very slow
X   also puts up a weird error message about translate() in 2D mode
_ make screen space fonts use get/set as well?
_   too much to debug on their own
_   unfortunately tint not set with setImpl, but...
_ optimize textMode(MODEL) with textMode(SCREEN)
_   in PGraphics and PGraphics3, check to see if matrix is within epsilon
_   of one of the rotation matrices (many fewer steps) 
_   if identity, or just translate, or a rotate, make OBJECT into SCREEN
_ not having kerning really blows
_   could this be pulled from the OpenType font stuff? 
_   it could be placed at the end of the file
_ not having fractional widths on small fonts really blows
_   screen space text looks crappy
_ working with vector fonts? 
_   need to be able to handle shapes within shapes (reverse winding)
_   ftgl: main code is in FTVectoriser
_   uses gluTessBeginContour and gluTessEndContour
_   and then does 5 step sizes for each curveto
_ show an error when using a font character that isn't available
_   maybe fall back on other characters instead?


CORE / PGraphics

_ y2 position of rectangles not same as y2 position of lines
_   happens when the rectangle is flipped on the x or y axis
_   probably a hack that draws the "last" point differently

_ lines
_   z value hack for lines is causing trouble for 2D
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1089737928;start=0
_   rewrite line and stroke code, it's a buggy mess
_     lines become 2 pixels thick after a 3D transform 
_     better handling of single-pixel special case
_       flat_line_retribution is a hack, can go away


CORE / PGraphicsJava2D

_ some optimizations from zach
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=os_core_pde;action=display;num=1121670787
_ textMode(SCREEN) needs to be faster
_   need flat image implementation that takes no transforms
_   along with 90, 180 and 270 versions of it as well
_   tie to glDrawPixels.. how to clear matrix properly for that?
_   maybe just disable this for JAVA2D cuz it's silly?
_ catch sun.dc.pr.PRException?

CORE / PImage

_ make loading images lighter, ala android 
_   require loadPixels to get 2D image data from images
_   only load PImage pixels when necessary (faster for java2d)
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=60
_ loadImage() should use the faster loading methods
_   hint(DISABLE_IMAGE_CACHING)
_   add a note to the loadImage() reference page
_ figure out why 1024x768 image takes 3.5 seconds to load
_   would using a BufferedImage work better?
_   is the image actually a BufferedImage so PixelGrabber is a waste?
_ work through loadPixels in PImage, how consistent do we need to be?
_   with get() and set() methods, this gets really tricky (too slow)
_   could optimize by keeping a java image around, but table for later
_     it's too significant a change, and not enough time to test
_ callback for requestImage()
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=641
_   might work with the selectXxxx() functions as well
_ img.get() quirks
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=167
_ image resizing is ugly (just use java2d?)
_   also deal with copy()/blend() inaccuracies

_ for a PGraphics2D, should its image cache object be the memoryimagesource?
_ loading lots of images is a problem, describe how to unload
_   is it possible? necessary to call delay(5) or something?
_ don't grab pixels of java2d images unless asked
_   this is the difference between a lot of loadPixels() and not
_   so important to have it in before beta if that's the change
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=60
_ add ability to control jpeg compression level with save() and saveFrame()
_   or just write a better example for this one?

CORE / PShape

_ we can do hit testing (at least in 2D) now that we rely on java2d
_ for subclasses, make it easy to grab the structure of vertices
_   actually, just use PShape internally and this will be easier
_ for PShape, need to be able to set the origin (flash people)


CORE / PShapeSVG

_ cover the svg changes in a future release
_ load PShape from a string object
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=277
_ breaking up classes / figure out how to handle fonts subclass
_ when using get(), reset the bounds for the objects
_   otherwise it's always relative to the original document
_ support for text (shouldn't be too bad, use createFont)
_   implement text spans for svg output
_ try enabling blending modes
_ add better support for attributes buried in styles (support ai9/10/11)
_ test what happens when transparency is used with gradient fill
_ look into transformation issues... guessing this is probably wrong
_   this may be what's throwing off the radial radius transform
_ implement A and a (elliptical arcs)
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=130
_ check for any other pieces of missing path api
_   multiple sets of coordinates after a command not supported
_   i.e. M with several coords means moveto followed by many linetos
_   also curveto with multiple sets of points is ignored
_ document somehow.. svg viewer will be discontinued
_   http://www.adobe.com/svg/eol.html


CORE / Mac OS X

_ set the application name to sketch name (not processing.core.PApplet)
_   System.setProperty("com.apple.mrj.application.apple.menu.about.name", ...)
_   -Xdock:name=<application name>
_   -Xdock:icon=<path to icon file>
_ cursor() broken in applets on macosx?
_   or is it a java 1.4 versus java 1.3 problem?

LIBRARIES / XML

_ ref: constructor has changed to .parse(...) instead of new XMLElement(str)
_ add XMLElement.listChildren() to reference
_ document XMLElement save() and write(), and their differences
_ questions re: final xml api changes
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=612
_ look into replacing nanoxml
_   http://www.exampledepot.com/egs/javax.xml.parsers/pkg.html
_ need to handle <!ENTITY tags for svg documents
_   get entity tags working in xml library for SVG
_ handle charset decoding in xml element parser?
_   same with the other methods like loadStrings()
_   could also be a way to handle gzip too?
_   tho charset + gzip would be a problem
_ vectors shouldn't be exposed, need to expose attr lists as arrays
_   or also add a method for getting the vectors?


more andres
_ implement setImpl() instead of set() inside PGraphicsOpenGL
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=121
_ use glCopyPixels() or glReadPixels() instead of copy() method
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=119
_ copy() does not update the screen with OpenGL
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=118
_ set() requires updatePixels() with OpenGL
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=89
_ first few frames of OpenGL sketches on Windows run slowly
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=107
_ updatePixels wth OpenGL requires a lot of memory, need better texture update
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=77
_ implement textMode(SHAPE) with OPENGL
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=738

_ opengl needs to shut itself down properly when closing applet
_   otherwise can crash the whole browser


LIBRARIES / PGraphicsPDF

_ pdf not rendering unicode with beginRecord()
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=90
_ beginRecord() doesn't use current settings of the sketch
_   sometimes reported as a bug, but probably not a good way to 
_   consistently carry these over
_ pdf sketches exiting before writing has finished
_   people have to call exit() (so that dispose() is called in particular)
_ when using noLoop() and the PDF renderer, sketch should exit gracefully
_   because isDisplayable() returns false, there's no coming back from noLoop

LATER / Optimize

_ put a wrapper around InputStream returned by createInput
_   that actually has some notion of the length of its input
_   that way, methods could use the information when reading
_ can loadBytes() be improved by querying file size first?
_   background 
_     this would require a new version of createInput(), which would query
_     the URL (or file) for an actual file size. the size is not always
_     available, so it can't be relied upon, but would help in some cases.
_   loadBytes() is used for images.. ouch
_   might be worth doing a test to see if it actually would help at all 
_     before rewriting all of createInput()
_ too much object creation in java2d
_   causes inconsistency/hiccups as the gc runs?


LATER (post 2.0)

_ add shader support
_ createColor() instead of color()?
_ route all exceptions through PException and catch method
_   advanced users can override the method if they want
_   or you can set an option to have PExceptions be raised
_   decision: just copy & paste the serial/net code.. 
_     until we can find a more compelling example
_ actual shape api for things like rectangles and whatnot?
_ should we kill import xxxx syntax for libraries? 
_   just give up and use a gui for it
_   cons: copy & paste breaks
_   pro: there's no guaranteed 1:1 between packages and single libraries
_ method of threading but queue an event to be run when safe
_   e.g. queueing items like mouse/keybd, but generic fxns
_ for begin/endRecord, use a piggyback mechanism
_   that way won't have to pass a PApplet around
_   this has a big impact on the SVG library
_   in fact, this maybe should be a library that does it
_     so that the file size can be much smaller
_ add setOutput() method across other renderers?
_ opengl.jar with eclipse
_   auto-extract native libs from opengl.jar 
_   to remove java.library.path problems (!)
_ introduce calc()
_   semantics of this are just too tricky, especially when it's not clear
_   what's actually gained by the split--would have to do weird hacks
_   to get the accum buffer, etc. to work anyway
_ add some sort of unprojectX/Y/Z method (based on glu fxn)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=OpenGL;action=display;num=1176483247
_ add a timer(obj, "functionname", 45) method
_   this can be used to schedule something to happen at a specific time
_   or import the swing timer (for actionPerformed)
_   also add interval("functionname", 40)
_ color(0, 0, 0, 0) produces black
_   because color(0, 0, 0, 0) creates an int that is simply '0'
_   although fill(0, 0, 0, 0) does the right thing
_   also, rgb255 not getting set
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=382
_ should fill(c) instead be fillColor(c)?
_ should color(123, 4, 99) instead be createColor()?
_ rounding errors on color conversion
_   colorMode(RGB, 1.0); colorMode(255); println(red(color(0.5,1,1)));
_   will return 127, instead of 128.
_ gray that's greater than the colorMode() can produce strange colors

_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1083650609
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1082481891
_ add stroke() to type
_   more for doing outlines-only and that sort of business
_ gradients
_   use gradients in a class for the svg lib for now
_   don't add api to main p5 stuff (though maybe setPaint/noPaint api?)
_   gradient-painted lines and fills
_     java2d will do both line and fill, illusfarter only does fills
_   gradients not supported in java2d
_     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=371
_ bspline or nurbs (later, want to do the 3D/arch stuff correctly)
_ non-homogenous coloring for curve vertices
_ exactly how should pixel filling work with single pixel strokes?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1025
_ consider bringing back text/image using cache/names
_ exactly how pixel-filling works for strokes
_   http://processing.org/bugs/bugzilla/1025.html
