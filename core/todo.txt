0079 core

_ size() doing a setBounds() is really bad
_   because it means things can't be embedded properly

_ printarr() of null array crashes without an error
_ actually, errors from many crashes not coming through on the mac?

_ proper full screen code for present mode
_   why do mouse motion events go away in full screen mode
_   or with a Window object

createGraphics and placement issues
_ make pappletgl work back inside papplet
_   and then size(300, 300, DEPTH) etc
_   get rid of opengl renderer menu
_   othersise hint() to use the p5 renderer instead of java2d
_ applet placement is screwy
_ how to force PGraphics() instead of PGraphics2()
o applets on osx (and windows) sometimes show up 20 pixels off the top 

_ saveFrame() is saving to sketch folder, save() is not

bezier/catmull rom curves
_ non-homogenous coloring for curve vertices
_ implement curveTangent

PApplet
_ check for what else inside PApplet should be static

PFont
_ text in a box is broken (at least for PGraphics2)
o   get text rect working again (seems to be in infinite loop)

PGraphics
_ fix-up the curve_init() and the rest to use matrices
_   and not have ugly names (i.e. just g.curveDetail is good)

PGraphics2
_ why is java2d so flickery?
X   is it because the lock was taken off (g) in PApplet?
_   test to see whether it's still happening
_ textSpace(SCREEN_SPACE) needs to be faster
_   need flat image implementation that takes no transforms
_   along with 90, 180 and 270 versions of it as well
_   tie to glDrawPixels.. how to clear matrix properly for that?
_ gradient-painted lines
Color c = new Color(0x00FFFF00, true);
GradientPaint gradient = 
  new GradientPaint(0,0,Color.red,100,100,c);
GeneralPath gp = new GeneralPath();
gp.moveTo(10, 10);
gp.lineTo(100, 90);
gp.lineTo(20, 50);
gp.closePath();
Graphics2D g2 = ((PGraphics2)g).g2;
g2.setPaint(gradient);
g2.draw(gp);

PGraphics3
_ tint() honoring alpha but not colored tint
_   check with the a_Displaying example and tint(255, 0, 0, 100);
_ make sure arc goes in the right direction that we want it to
_   (make sure that PGraphics3 goes the same direction)
_ Stroking a rect() leaves the upper right pixel off.
_   also, points not working in opengl (carlos line truncation?)
void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  background(0);
}
void draw() {
  stroke(255);
  point(60, 30);
}
_ error message saying that strokeCap and strokeJoin don't work

PGraphicsGL
_ implement copy() and blend()
_ background color seems to be wrong?

. . . . . 

add simon's new 3d code as soon as he has gl working
  and make a release based on that

0079 java 1.1 graphics comes back

0080 export to application


api questions

_ sphere x,y,z,r or box w,h,d.. need to make them consistent

_ BLUR - write simple blur
_   how does photoshop handle this?
_ BLUR - add gaussian blur

_ remove SCREEN_SPACE altogether? 
_ PImage.filter() 
_   maybe use quasimondo's gaussian blur code?
_     http://incubator.quasimondo.com/processing/gaussian_blur_1.php
o   filter() on subsections? yes, in keeping with rest of api
X   no, in keeping with getting shit done

_ might be able to do a typed expand()
public Object growArray(Object array, int size) {
    Class type = array.getClass().getComponentType();
    Object grown = Array.newInstance(type, size);
    System.arraycopy(array, 0, grown, 0,
        Math.min(Array.getLength(array), size));
    return grown;
}
_ should nf() handle commas as well?
_   yes, and add nf(int what) so that non-padded version works
_   but don't put commas into the zero-padded version
_   make nf/nfs/nfp not so weird
_ image(String name) and textFont(String name)
_   do we change to font(arial, 12) ?
_ how to shut off rendering to screen when illustrator in use? 
_   need size(30000, 20000) for illustrator, problem in papplet
_ be consistent about getXxx() methods
_   just use the variable names.. don't do overkill on fillR et al
_   or just what functions are actually made public
_   is fillRi needed? it's pretty goofy..
_ how to handle full screen (opengl especially) or no screen (for scripts)
_ implement fullsize().. this takes over the screen as best it can
_   or should it be more like present mode?
_   that if applet is 500x500, centers on a 800x600 window
_   though how do you get the screen size? 
_     screen.width and screen.height? - yes
_   write java 1.3 code for full screen version of PApplet
_     this might be used for presentation mode
_ go through and see what functions (no pixel ops?) frame recorders should have
_ expose api to launch files, folders, URLs
_   use with/in place of link()

_ PPolygon no longer in use and PLine is a mess

video lib
_ grabbing sub-devices from camera in the lib (via list() or whatever)
_   actually, need to use numbered indices (multiple w/ same name)
_     list should be: "0 - Logitech QuickCam (Blah)"
_     and then use the indices (or the str i guess) to choose

_ something really bad happened with println() in this release
_   perhaps only without a code folder and/or running in java2d mode?
_   this may also be what's hosing 

_ text should maybe use built-in font if available?
_ don't use pixels to do screen space text inside PFont
_   add a function in PGraphics for direct pixel image impl 
_   in java2d, can quickly blit the image itself
_   this way, can isolate it for gl too, which will use glBitmap
_ textFont with a named font can use the renderer/os font
_   PFont.list() to return string list of all the available fonts
_   for postscript, can grab the real font
_   -> altho problem here is that really the fonts just need a name
_      since needs to render to screen as well

_ rewrite library/howto.txt for to get rid of old interface

_ also have a simple way to hook in triangle leeches to PGraphics3
_   this exists, but needs to be documented, or have accessors

_ sphere() and box() should set normals and take textures

_ fix tint() for PGraphics3 (what could be wrong?)
_   maybe not setting fill color when drawing textures
_   guessing it's an implementation issue in sami's renderer

_ make Graphics2 et al load dynamically using reflection
_   can this be done with g2 and if exception just falls back to g1?
_   this way people can remove g1 by hand

to be fixed with new lighting
_ The PushPop example in Transformations is not working
_   with lights() callled
_ The transparency of the Rotate3D example in Translformations
_   is not as expected
_ lighting totally sucks (both PGraphics3 and PGraphicsGL)
_ bring in materials for opengl as well?
_   don't include a class, just make it similar to the light functions

_ get PGraphics.java engine working again

_ beginShape() 
_   don't allow you to draw stroked items unless stroke() is called
_   don't allow beginShape() if shape is already set
_     (otherwise will cause some very strange errors)

_ basic sample audio playback needed for p5
_   make separate java 1.1 and java 1.3 classes

_ microphone input for java 1.3
_   this may be reason to move sound classes out into a lib?
_   or maybe just microphone goes into its own library?

_ image loading bug is huge
_ figure out how to handle cached images, multiple images
_   MediaTracker blocking is prolly making jar download really slow
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1089914280;start=0
_ also threaded images

_ 404 error because first searches applet directory on zipdecode

//

_ when running externally, applets don't always get placed properly
_   if size is never set, then doesn't always layout
_   problem is in gl and in core, and is inconsistent
_   move more logic for layout into PApplet.. maybe a static method?
_   this way can avoid duplicating / breaking things

opengl
_ fix non-bound textures from mangling everything else
_ fix enable/disable textures for some objects
_ fix endian ordering issues so that things work properly
_ figure out min/max texture sizes when binding to avoid problems
_   minimum texture size may be 64x64
_   might need to enforce it as a minimum
_ what should the update image function be called?
_ box and sphere are broken in gl
_ metaballs example dies when using box()
_   long string of exceptions, which are also missing their newlines
_ get loop, noLoop, redraw, and framerate all working in opengl
_   needs custom animator thread..
_ depth() shouldn't be needed for opengl unless actually 3D
_   right now the camera doesn't get set up unless you call depth()
_ resolve ARGB versus RGBA versus just A issues for fonts
_   make sure that current scenario works identically on mac
_   if so, just switch the image code to expect alpha in the high bits
_   fonts probably need to be RGBA, not ALPHA style images
_   there's nothing really ALPHA about them?


//

_ should image i/o and sound i/o be moved into PImage and PSound?
_   how to load external encoders/decoders

scripting
_ on exceptions, use die to just kill the applet
_ make the file i/o stuff work more cleanly
_   if people want to use their own file i/o they can do that too
_ how to make a long setup() sleep so that things don't lock way up
_   this could also be contributing to the hanging bug
_ make properly exit after things are finished
_ static applets need to be able to resize themselves on 'play'
_ figure out what to do with static apps exported as application
_   needs to just hang there
_ scripts (w/ no graphics) will need to call exit() explicitly
_   actually.. just override the default draw() to say exit()
_ may need a fileOutput() and fileInput() function
_   to take care of exception handling
_ or maybe scripts are just handled with a different method? (yech)
_   or maybe setup() can actually throw and Exception?
_   but that's inserted by the parser, and hidden from the user?
_ implement size(0, 0) -> just doesn't bother doing a frame.show();
_   too abstract, just have draw() call exit by default
_   so if nothing inside draw, just quits

_ need to make sure that components can be resized properly via size()
_   or that it properly responds to a setBounds() call

_ also when drawing an image, sense whether drawn rotated
_   specifically, if drawn rotated 90 in either direction, or 180
_   if just rotate/translate, then can use SCREEN_SPACE for fonts
_ bring screen space and font size settings back in to PGraphics
_   causing too much trouble to be stuck down in PFont

random tasks
_ someone to figure out a good model for adaptive sizing of circles
_   also goes for arcs, though will be weighted based on arc size
_ figure out why tiff images won't open with after effects
_   open with photoshop, resave, see which tags change
_   particularly of those that are included in the original image
_   perhaps something gets corrected? 

_ need timer in as part of the api
_   or at least include an example that uses it

_ depth testing of lines vs text is problematic
_   probably need to patch in an older version of the line code
_   use depth()/noDepth() to handle depth test

_ y2 position of rectangles not same as y2 position of lines
_   happens when the rectangle is flipped on the x or y axis
_   probably a hack that draws the "last" point differently

_ fishwick bug with text() and shapes
_   ellipses no longer completed when g.dimensions = 2 or 3,
_   or not even drawn.. what a mess.

_ break apart functions into local (placement) and override (blitting)
_   just have a "thin_flat_line" option in opengl code

_ go through and figure out what stuff to make public

text issues
_ text() with \n is semi-broken
_ font encoding issues
_   java seems to force straight windows encoding.. (problem for pi fonts)
_   opentype/cff fonts don't work with live loading from the app
_   many (all?) opentype fonts won't show up or aren't supported
_     this may be only cff fonts that have trouble
_   when encoding with something besides the standard encoding, problematic
_     so sonata otf and sonata don't seem to have any chars at all
_ getAllFonts() not quite working for many fonts
_   i.e. Orator Std on windows.. macosx seems to be ok
_   is getFamilyNames() any different/better?
_   when did this break? 1.4.1? 1.4.x vs 1.3?
_   may be that cff fonts won't work?
_ textMode ALIGN_CENTER _LEFT _RIGHT -> CENTER, LEFT, RIGHT ? 
_ need to resolve SCREEN_SPACE vs OBJECT_SPACE
_   can this be auto-detected with noDepth()? 
_   how does rotated text work?
_     PFont.rotate(180) rotate(PI)
_     or can this be detected from the matrix?
_   does the font or PApplet control the size? (the font, ala java)
_   without setting the font, SCREEN_SPACE comes out weird
_   move SCREEN_SPACE into ScreenFont() class?
_     probably not, casey thinks screen space text is prolly more useful
_     that way can clear up some of the general confusion in the code
_   check into symbol font encoding with create font

text wish list
_ look into fixing the texture mapping to not squash fonts
_   NEW_GRAPHICS totally smashes everything
_ not having kerning really blows
_   could this be pulled from the OpenType font stuff? 
_   it could be placed at the end of the file
_ simple way to just use java text in p5 applets? 
_   the current text support is just so hokey

_ named colors.. have a method for a full color lookup table
_   addcolor("blah blah blah", colornum);
_   fill("blah blah blah");
_   maybe this is bad practice--too slow, should use variables

_ illustrator export / rendering mode
_   also postscript or pdf export?
_   update illustrator code to use core api
_     even if not actually working properly.. just in naming of things
_   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
_   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
_     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
o   version of BApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.

   1 _ put SecurityException things around file i/o for applets
   1 _   rather than checking online(), since applets might be signed
   1 _ saveFrame() at the end of a draw mode program is problematic
   1 _   app might exit before the file has finished writing to disk
   1 _   need to block other activity inside screenGrab until finished

   1 _ what is the stroked version of a sphere? a circle?
   1 _ too many push() will silently stop the applet inside a loop
   1 _ test winding polygons in different directions
   1 _ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
   1 _ better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
   1 _ is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
   1 _   may be correct, it worked for nik
   1 _ inside draw() mode, delay() does nothing
   1 _   delay might be a good way to signal drawing to the screen/updating
   1 _ catch security exceptions around applet i/o calls
   1 _   not just for saving files, but provide better error msgs when
   1 _     attempting to download from another server
   1 _ array utilities on Object[] are worthless.. fix it with reflection?
   1 _   see if reflection will allow expand for all class types

CORE / Documentation

   1 _ write documentation on general use of processing.core
   1 _   along with how to download from sourceforge (anonpass is blank)
   1 _   note that applet is itself a Component


CORE / Mac OS X

   b _ still some weirdness with thread flickering on the mac

CORE / PFont


CORE / New Graphics
What the hell do we do with this code?

   1 _ stroke not set on flat_rect
   1 _ when drawing fonts w/ sami's code, left edge has problem
   1 _   8-bit (alpha) textures not blending 
   1 _ near-plane clipping currently disabled for triangles, enabled for lines
   1 _   (but culling offscreen triangles works.. but may have been
   1 _   commented out by carlos)
   1 _ hint(NEW_GRAPHICS) needs to be called before allocate()
   1 _   otherwise stencil buffer and 'triangle' object are null on first run
