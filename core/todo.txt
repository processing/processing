_     because it's too messy to retain the triangle objects and info
_ when using things like PGraphicsPDF, need to not resize window
_   if it doesn't display to the screen, needs to never show a window
_   basically if the main gfx context isn't viewable, close the window
_   since it may have already been opened at 100x100
_   avoid opening it in the first place?
_ calling recordFrame() from mousePressed is important
_   dangerous tho because mouse fxn called just before endFrame

_ add texture support to recordShapesRaw (this might be pretty obscure...)

_ should PGraphics be a base class with implementations and variables?
_   then PGraphics2D and PGraphics3D that subclass it?

_ need to test/straighten out load/update pixels
_   loadPixels() and updatePixels() only need to be used when 
_   touching pixels[]. All other functions including get(), set(),
_   filter(), etc shouldn't need them. 
_ fjen says blend() doens't work in JAVA2D
_   the functions are fairly well separated now in PMethods
_   just go through all the stuff to make sure it's setting properly
_ don't do a loadPixels unless an updatePixels has completed
_   tho this won't affect anything, since either it's an image buffer
_   or it's the PGraphics object, which does an updatePixels() immediately
_ if (modified) don't loadPixels again, just ignore it
_   make a note that updatePixels() only sets a flag in PImage
_     (but not PGraphics, which does it immediately)

GRAPHICS LIBRARY

A hybrid of OpenGL (3D Graphics) and some aspects of Postscript (Fill, Stroke)
The graphics library was formerly called Bagel.


CORE / PApplet

_ typed version of array functions:
_   append(), shorten(), splice, slice, subset, concat, reverse
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=115
_ would be cool if could sort w/o the sort class..
_   meaning use reflection to sort objects, just by implementing a few methods
_   would be much simpler and less confusing than new Sort() etc 
_   or would it be ridiculously slow?
_ make a PException that extends RuntimeException but packages an ex?
_   http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html
_ is mousePressed broken with noLoop() or redraw()?
_ check for what else inside PApplet should be static
_   maybe catch RuntimeExceptions in the called sub-functions
_   that way more stuff can be static w/o losing useful error handling
_   (emitting errors when closest to source.. i.e. w/ the filename)
_ size() inside draw is missing a new call to cameraMode, etc
_ fix param() to use a sketch.properties file when run as an app
_   make this also be used in generating the html file
_ fix link() to handle relative URLs
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081710684;start=0
_ put SecurityException things around file i/o for applets
_   rather than checking online(), since applets might be signed
_ saveFrame() at the end of a draw mode program is problematic
_   app might exit before the file has finished writing to disk
_   need to block other activity inside screenGrab until finished
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081706752
_ problems with defining fill(255) vs fill(0xff808080)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1083650609
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1082481891
_ test winding polygons in different directions
_ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
_ better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
_ is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
_   may be correct, it worked for nik
_ inside draw() mode, delay() does nothing
_   delay might be a good way to signal drawing to the screen/updating
_ catch security exceptions around applet i/o calls
_   not just for saving files, but provide better error msgs when
_     attempting to download from another server
_ array utilities on Object[] are worthless.. fix it with reflection?
_   see if reflection will allow expand for all class types
_ ed's thread re: fullscreen strategies
_   could add a new BApplet that uses BufferStrategy?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1081335361;start=15
_ placement of 100x100 items is odd
_   happens with P3D and maybe also P2D?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=128
_ fileInput() and fileOutput() may not agree with draw()
_   not yet verified
_   can only be used inside of setup()?
_ cellular automata examples broken
_ size() has memory limitations (pitaru)
_   catch OutOfMemoryError inside size() and let the user know
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1038847001
_ files not in the data folder (works in env, not in sketch)


CORE / PApplet - main()

_ refactor PApplet.main() and Runner.startInternal() to remove duplication
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=245
_ present mode is flakey.. applet doesn't always come up
_   seems like hitting stop helps shut it down?
_   is full screen window not being taken down properly?
_   has this fixed itself, or is it an issue with launching externally?
_ implement full screen mode.. this takes over the screen as best it can
_   size(screen.width, screen.height, OPENGL);
_   if size is screen.width and screen.height, does its best
_   needs to get the size of the main screen
_   this probably works but just needs to be tested
_   exceptions in full screen mode will quit the app completely
_     can't keep window open because things are hosed
_   default is that full screen app doesn't cover multiple displays
_     this is fine since opengl can't usually go across both
_     but include an example for how to use full in gl 
_ ability to select monitor via preferences panel
_   this applies to any applet that's run externally currently (verify)
_   make it also work with anything that's run inside of p5 itself
_     this means changing the frame creation code inside Runner
_   check current present code with multiple monitors
_ hitting cmd-q when an applet is running quits p5 (on macosx)
_   but cmd-q when running externally is ok because it just quits
_   is there a way to catch cmd-q when running a sketch? 
_     so that it could avoid quitting if the sketch hasn't been stopped
_     or if the sketch window is foremost
_     maybe a hack where a new menubar is added? 


CORE / PFont and text()

_ leading looks too big, at least in PGraphics2 with news gothic
_   though it may be the converted version of the .ttf?
_ font encoding issues 
_   java seems to force straight windows encoding.. (problem for pi fonts)
_   opentype/cff fonts don't work with live loading from the app
_   many (all?) opentype fonts won't show up or aren't supported
_     this may be only cff fonts that have trouble
_   when encoding is not the standard encoding, problematic
_     so sonata otf and sonata don't seem to have any chars at all
_ available font issues
_   is getFontList returning a different set of fonts from device2d?
_     try it out on java 1.3 versus 1.4
_   getAllFonts() not quite working for many fonts
_   i.e. Orator Std on windows.. macosx seems to be ok
_   is getFamilyNames() any different/better?
_   when did this break? 1.4.1? 1.4.x vs 1.3?
_   may be that cff fonts won't work?
_   or is it only those with ps names?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1117445969
_ createFont not working from applets
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1115877723;start=0
_ createFont() with a .ttf doesn't work in applets?
_   throws a security exception because of the reflection stuff
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1115877723;start=0
_ text() with a z coordinate is now using translate, very slow
X   also puts up a weird error message about translate() in 2D mode
_ make screen space fonts use get/set as well?
_   too much to debug on their own
_   unfortunately tint not set with setImpl, but...
_ optimize textMode(MODEL) with textMode(SCREEN)
_   in PGraphics and PGraphics3, check to see if matrix is within epsilon
_   of one of the rotation matrices (many fewer steps) 
_   if identity, or just translate, or a rotate, make OBJECT into SCREEN
_ not having kerning really blows
_   could this be pulled from the OpenType font stuff? 
_   it could be placed at the end of the file
_ not having fractional widths on small fonts really blows
_   screen space text looks crappy
_ working with vector fonts? 
_   need to be able to handle shapes within shapes (reverse winding)
_   ftgl: main code is in FTVectoriser
_   uses gluTessBeginContour and gluTessEndContour
_   and then does 5 step sizes for each curveto


CORE / PGraphics


_ cairo tesselation used: 
_   John Hobby, Practical Segment Intersection with Finite Precision
_   Output. Computational Geometry Theory and Application, 13(4), 1999.
_ possible leads re: rendering stuff
_   http://people.csail.mit.edu/bmcutler/
_   http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/
_ finish implementation so 1.1 support can return
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=125
_ alter bezier and curve matrices to use PMatrix
_   float array stuff is redundant with code that's in PMatrix
_   and PMatrix has to be included even w/o P3D so...
_ y2 position of rectangles not same as y2 position of lines
_   happens when the rectangle is flipped on the x or y axis
_   probably a hack that draws the "last" point differently
_ beginShape() 
_   don't allow you to draw stroked items unless stroke() is called
_   don't allow beginShape() if shape is already set
_     (otherwise will cause some very strange errors)
_ figure out a good model for adaptive sizing of circles
_   also goes for arcs, though will be weighted based on arc size
_ point() issues
_   point() being funneled through beginShape is terribly slow
_     go the other way 'round
_   sometimes broken, could be a problem with java 1.5? (was using win2k)
noStroke();
colorMode(RGB, 100);  
for(int i=0; i<100; i++) {  
  for(int j=0; j<100; j++) {  
    stroke(i, j, 0);  
    point(i, j);  
  }  
}  
As an aside, set() is at least 10x faster, and 
perhaps should be used in these examples anyway.

_   NullPointerException apparently when things way offscreen
_     i.e. glyphrot with scale set to 4
_     or at least that things get ridiculously slow
_     clipping issues here.. but also something in scan converter
_     not clipping areas from offscreen
_       huge geometry slows things way down

_ don't let users on < 1.3 load JAVA2D
_ set upper bound on framerate so as not to completely hose things?
_ textSpace(SCREEN_SPACE) needs to be faster
_   need flat image implementation that takes no transforms
_   along with 90, 180 and 270 versions of it as well
_   tie to glDrawPixels.. how to clear matrix properly for that?

CORE / PGraphics3

_ rect() changes size as it changes position
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=95
_ lines skip on 200x200 surface because of fixed point rounding error
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=267
_ polygons perpendicular to axis not drawing
_   is this a clipping error?
_   probably a triangulation error, because triangles work ok
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=111
_ concave polygons having trouble if points come back to meet 
_   tesselator/triangulator gets confused when points doubled up
_   might need to avoid previous vertex hitting itself
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=97
_   graphics gems 5 has more about tessellation
_ P3D not doing bilinear interpolation in text and images 
_   because smooth() has to be set (and smooth throws an error in P3D)
_   how should this be handled? a hint? allowing smooth()?
_   probably just allow smooth() but don't smooth anything
_ ortho() is doing things strangely
_   seems to be mapping to 0, 0 - width/2, height/2
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1115919744;start=0

_ Stroking a rect() leaves off the upper right pixel
_ PPolygon no longer in use and PLine is a mess
_   make a version of PGraphics3 that uses it for more accurate rendering?
_ add option to sort triangles back to front so alpha works

CORE / PImage
_ P5 cannot read files generated by saveFrame()
_   need to update docs re: tga
_   and add support for reading its own uncompressed TIFs
_ don't grab pixels of java2d images unless asked
_   this is the difference between a lot of loadPixels() and not
_   so important to have it in before beta if that's the change
_ also when drawing an image, sense whether drawn rotated
_   specifically, if drawn rotated 90 in either direction, or 180
_   if just rotate/translate, then can use SCREEN_SPACE for fonts
_ alpha not set on saveFrame, so can't be used in photoshop as a layer
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=general;action=display;num=1078441623
_ should image i/o and sound i/o be moved into PImage and PSound?
_ figure out why tiff images won't open with after effects
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=153
_   open with photoshop, resave, see which tags change
_     specifically, which tags that were in the original image file
_     perhaps something gets corrected? 
_ loadImage() using spaces in the name
_   if loadImage() with spaces when online(), throw an error


CORE / PSound

_ duration as an internal param, not a function
_ When a sound is finished playing, 
_   it should return to 0 so it can play again
_ Putting sound.loop() in draw() seemed to spawn multiple sounds threads?
_ After a sound is paused, it will only play from where it was paused
_   to its end and will not loop again
_ The ref in PSound2 says volume accepts vals from 0...1
_   but values larger than one increase the volume.
_ SoundEvent // is sound finished?? Can't access now. 
_ make java 1.1 version of PSound work properly
_ merge PSound and PSound2 via reflection?
_   once debugged, merge these back together and use reflection
_     (unless it's a messy disaster)
_ Unsupported control type: Master Gain 
_   what's actually causing this error?

CORE / General 

_ remove some of the bloat, how can we make things more compact?
_   i.e. if not using 3D, can leave out PGraphics3, PTriangle, PLine
_   PPolygon isn't currently used for anything, should remove it

_ fix non-bound textures from mangling everything else
_ fix enable/disable textures for some objects
_ fix endian ordering issues so that things work properly
_ figure out min/max texture sizes when binding to avoid problems
_   minimum texture size may be 64x64
_   might need to enforce it as a minimum
_ what should the update image function be called?
_ box and sphere are broken in gl
_ metaballs example dies when using box()
_   long string of exceptions, which are also missing their newlines
_ get loop, noLoop, redraw, and framerate all working in opengl
_   needs custom animator thread..
_ depth() shouldn't be needed for opengl unless actually 3D
_   right now the camera doesn't get set up unless you call depth()
_ resolve ARGB versus RGBA versus just A issues for fonts
_   make sure that current scenario works identically on mac
_   if so, just switch the image code to expect alpha in the high bits
_   fonts probably need to be RGBA, not ALPHA style images
_   there's nothing really ALPHA about them?
_ gl alpha on images when flipped around backwards
_   will sorting based on depth help this? also ask simon for ideas
_ rewrite getImpl/setImpl inside opengl
_ bit shifting in opengl, get down to 2 ops by using other image modes
_   i.e. ABGR_EXT might allow for just two shifts instead of 4
_ allow access to native pixel buffer in opengl and power of 2
_   so that no need to copy/update everything
_ need to write an error if people try to use opengl with 1.3 (i.e. on export)

PGraphicsAI

_ illustrator export / rendering mode
_   also postscript or pdf export?
_   update illustrator code to use core api
_     even if not actually working properly.. just in naming of things
_   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
_   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
_     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
o   version of BApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.
