_ is camera backwards, or staying fixed and moving the scene?
_   camera() is broken, should be ok to call it at beinning of loop
_   end of lookat might be backwards
_   or endCamera might be swapping camera and cameraInv
_     beginCamera also grabs it backwards

present mode fixes
_ for present mode, need to set a default display 
_   currently crashes if only --present is specified w/o --display
_ present mode is flakey.. applet doesn't always come up
_   seems like hitting stop helps shut it down?
_   is full screen window not being taken down properly?
_ esc should kill fullscreen mode
_   can a key handler be added to the window?
_   how can this be shut off for presentations?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1114027594;start=0
_ implement full screen mode.. this takes over the screen as best it can
_   size(screen.width, screen.height, OPENGL);
_   if size is screen.width and screen.height, does its best
_   needs to get the size of the main screen
_ ability to select monitor via preferences panel
_   this applies to any applet that's run externally currently (verify)
_   make it also work with anything that's run inside of p5 itself
_ check current present code with multiple monitors
_ first pass on full screen
_   exceptions in full screen mode will quit the app completely
_   (can't keep window open because things are hosed)
_   default is that full screen app doesn't cover multiple displays
_     this is fine since opengl can't usually go across both
_     but include an example for how to use full in gl 
_     (use toolkit.getscreensize)

_ seem to be problems with updatePixels() on the mac
_   appears to run asynchronously

_ don't do a loadPixels unless an updatePixels has completed
_   tho this won't affect anything, since either it's an image buffer
_   or it's the PGraphics object, which does an updatePixels() immediately

_ the draw() method must exist, otherwise the sketch won't run

_ web colors with alpha: 0xffcc0080 or unhex("ffcc0080")

_ point appears to be broken
_   could be a problem with java 1.5? (was using win2k)

As an aside, set() is at least 10x faster, and 
perhaps should be used in these examples anyway.

NOT COMPLETELY NECESSARY BEFORE BETA

_ bizarre image loading error with c_Rollover.zip

_ text() with a z coordinate is now using translate, very slow
_   also puts up a weird error message about translate() in 2D mode

_ set upper bound on framerate so as not to completely hose things?
_ fix the flicker in java2d mode
_   not clear what's happening here
_   appears to be much worse (unfinished drawing) on macosx
_     try turning off hw accel on the mac to see if that's the problem

_ post() method to send a bunch of crap to a web url?
_   or an example that does this?

_ bit shifting in opengl, get down to 2 ops by using other image modes
_   i.e. ABGR_EXT might allow for just two shifts instead of 4
_ allow access to native pixel buffer in opengl and power of 2
_   so that no need to copy/update everything
_ need to write an error if people try to use opengl with 1.3 (i.e. on export)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Contribution_3DOpenGL;action=display;num=1114368123;start=3
_ grabbing sun.cpu.endian throws a security exception with gl applets
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Contribution_3DOpenGL;action=display;num=1114368123;start=3

_ make the 1.4 code in PApplet load via reflection
_   doesn't appear necessary with 1.3 applets

_ make get/getImpl for PGraphics/PGraphics2
_   make sure there's a loadPixels/updatePixels in PGraphics2
_ rewrite getImpl/setImpl inside opengl
_ make screen space fonts use get/set as well?
_   too much to debug on their own
_   unfortunately tint not set with setImpl, but...

_ get/set doesn't use tint at all
_   (meaning that it's not so good for fonts)

_ apply tint() to textures as well
_   otherwise no good way to color textures

_ textMode(SCREEN) having issues

_ set(x, y, image)
_   x, y not setting with processing
_   y reversed in openGL 

_ gl alpha on images when flipped around backwards
_   will sorting based on depth help this? also ask simon for ideas

_ cellular automata examples broken

_ gl smoothing.. how to disable polygon but keep line enabled
_   or at least make a note of this?
_   leave smooth off, get the gl object, then enable line smooth

_ gl points not working again

_ make illustrator lib

_ move really general things out of PConstants (X, Y, Z..)

sound
_ duration as an internal param, not a function
_ When a sound is finished playing, it should return to 0 so it can play again
_ Putting sound.loop() in draw() seemed to spawn multiple sounds threads?
_ After a sound is paused, it will only play from where it was paused
_   to its end and will not loop again
_ The ref in PSound2 says volume accepts vals from 0...1
_   but values larger than one increase the volume.
_ SoundEvent // is sound finished?? Can't access now. 

_ don't grab pixels of java2d images unless asked
_   this is the difference between a lot of loadPixels() and not
_   so important to have it in before beta if that's the change

_ if (modified) don't loadPixels again, just ignore it
_   make a note that updatePixels() only sets a flag in PImage
_     (but not PGraphics, which does it immediately)

_ make vertexCount etc properly accessible in PGraphics3
_   so that people can do things like the dxf renderer

_ add something to PApplet to have constants for the platform
_   needed for error messages (don't talk about winvdig on mac)
_   and also useful for programs

PApplet
_ check for what else inside PApplet should be static
_   maybe catch RuntimeExceptions in the called sub-functions
_   that way more stuff can be static w/o losing useful error handling
_   (emitting errors when closest to source.. i.e. w/ the filename)

PGraphics3
_ error message saying that strokeCap and strokeJoin don't work
_ PPolygon no longer in use and PLine is a mess
_ also have a simple way to hook in triangle leeches to PGraphics3
_   this exists, but needs to be documented, or have accessors


to be fixed with new lighting
_ The PushPop example in Transformations is not working
_   with lights() callled
_ The transparency of the Rotate3D example in Translformations
_   is not as expected
_ lighting totally sucks (both PGraphics3 and PGraphicsGL)
_ bring in materials for opengl as well?
_   don't include a class, just make it similar to the light functions
_ sphere() and box() should set normals and take textures
_ background color seems to be wrong?
_   check this once lighting actually works

_ don't let users on < 1.3 load JAVA2D, or < 1.4 load OPENGL

PApplet
_ printarr() of null array crashes without an error
_   actually, errors from many crashes not coming through on the mac?
_ allow save(), saveFrame() et al to properly pass in absolute paths
_   (so that it doesn't always save to the applet folder)
_   could require that save() takes an absolute path?
_ size() inside draw is missing a new call to cameraMode, etc

PGraphics
_ new PGraphics(PImage)

PGraphics2
_ textSpace(SCREEN_SPACE) needs to be faster
_   need flat image implementation that takes no transforms
_   along with 90, 180 and 270 versions of it as well
_   tie to glDrawPixels.. how to clear matrix properly for that?
_ gradient-painted lines
Color c = new Color(0x00FFFF00, true);
GradientPaint gradient = 
  new GradientPaint(0,0,Color.red,100,100,c);
GeneralPath gp = new GeneralPath();
gp.moveTo(10, 10);
gp.lineTo(100, 90);
gp.lineTo(20, 50);
gp.closePath();
Graphics2D g2 = ((PGraphics2)g).g2;
g2.setPaint(gradient);
g2.draw(gp);

PGraphics3
_ fix tint() for PGraphics3 (what could be wrong?)
_   tint() honoring alpha but not colored tint
_   maybe not setting fill color when drawing textures
_   guessing it's an implementation issue in sami's renderer
_   check with the a_Displaying example and tint(255, 0, 0, 100);
_ Stroking a rect() leaves the upper right pixel off.


_ beginShape() 
_   don't allow you to draw stroked items unless stroke() is called
_   don't allow beginShape() if shape is already set
_     (otherwise will cause some very strange errors)

_ image loading bug is huge
_ figure out how to handle cached images, multiple images
_   MediaTracker blocking is prolly making jar download really slow
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1089914280;start=0
_ also threaded images

_ 404 error because first searches applet directory on zipdecode

//

opengl
_ fix non-bound textures from mangling everything else
_ fix enable/disable textures for some objects
_ fix endian ordering issues so that things work properly
_ figure out min/max texture sizes when binding to avoid problems
_   minimum texture size may be 64x64
_   might need to enforce it as a minimum
_ what should the update image function be called?
_ box and sphere are broken in gl
_ metaballs example dies when using box()
_   long string of exceptions, which are also missing their newlines
_ get loop, noLoop, redraw, and framerate all working in opengl
_   needs custom animator thread..
_ depth() shouldn't be needed for opengl unless actually 3D
_   right now the camera doesn't get set up unless you call depth()
_ resolve ARGB versus RGBA versus just A issues for fonts
_   make sure that current scenario works identically on mac
_   if so, just switch the image code to expect alpha in the high bits
_   fonts probably need to be RGBA, not ALPHA style images
_   there's nothing really ALPHA about them?

//

_ should image i/o and sound i/o be moved into PImage and PSound?
_   how to load external encoders/decoders

scripting
_ on exceptions, use die to just kill the applet
_ make the file i/o stuff work more cleanly
_   if people want to use their own file i/o they can do that too
_ how to make a long setup() sleep so that things don't lock way up
_   this could also be contributing to the hanging bug
_ static applets need to be able to resize themselves on 'play'
_ figure out what to do with static apps exported as application
_   needs to just hang there
_ scripts (w/ no graphics) will need to call exit() explicitly
_   actually.. just override the default draw() to say exit()
_ may need a fileOutput() and fileInput() function
_   to take care of exception handling
_ or maybe scripts are just handled with a different method? (yech)
_   or maybe setup() can actually throw and Exception?
_   but that's inserted by the parser, and hidden from the user?
o implement size(0, 0) -> just doesn't bother doing a frame.show();
o   too abstract, just have draw() call exit by default
o   so if nothing inside draw, just quits
o   make properly exit after things are finished
_   add exit() function to actually explicitly quit
_   scripts will just require that people include exit at the end

_ need to make sure that components can be resized properly via size()
_   or that it properly responds to a setBounds() call

_ also when drawing an image, sense whether drawn rotated
_   specifically, if drawn rotated 90 in either direction, or 180
_   if just rotate/translate, then can use SCREEN_SPACE for fonts
_ bring screen space and font size settings back in to PGraphics
_   causing too much trouble to be stuck down in PFont

random tasks
_ someone to figure out a good model for adaptive sizing of circles
_   also goes for arcs, though will be weighted based on arc size
_ figure out why tiff images won't open with after effects
_   open with photoshop, resave, see which tags change
_   particularly of those that are included in the original image
_   perhaps something gets corrected? 

_ need timer in as part of the api
_   or at least include an example that uses it

_ depth testing of lines vs text is problematic
_   probably need to patch in an older version of the line code
_   use depth()/noDepth() to handle depth test

_ y2 position of rectangles not same as y2 position of lines
_   happens when the rectangle is flipped on the x or y axis
_   probably a hack that draws the "last" point differently

_ fishwick bug with text() and shapes
_   ellipses no longer completed when g.dimensions = 2 or 3,
_   or not even drawn.. what a mess.

_ break apart functions into local (placement) and override (blitting)
_   just have a "thin_flat_line" option in opengl code

_ go through and figure out what stuff to make public

_ how does ftgl handle tesselation? will our tesselator just work?
_   main code is in FTVectoriser
_   uses gluTessBeginContour and gluTessEndContour
_   and then does 5 step sizes for each curveto

_ illustrator export / rendering mode
_   also postscript or pdf export?
_   update illustrator code to use core api
_     even if not actually working properly.. just in naming of things
_   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
_   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
_     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
o   version of BApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.

   b _   very odd, "doom era" stuff
   b _   would it be possible to have a 'slow but accurate' mode?

   b _ clipping planes

   b _   things are flying into the camera and halting apps
   b _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1042699742
   b _   NullPointerException apparently when things way offscreen
   b _     i.e. glyphrot with scale set to 4
   b _     or at least that things get ridiculously slow
   b _     clipping issues here.. but also something in scan converter
   b _     not clipping areas from offscreen
   b _       huge geometry slows things way down

   1 _ points
   1 _   point() being funneled through beginShape is terribly slow
   1 _     go the other way 'round

   1 _ add option to sort triangles back to front so alpha works

CORE / PFont

   1 _ optimize textMode(MODEL) with textMode(SCREEN)
   1 _   in PGraphics and PGraphics3, check to see if matrix is within epsilon
   1 _   of one of the rotation matrices (many fewer steps) 
   1 _   if identity, or just translate, or a rotate, make OBJECT into SCREEN
   1 _ optimize fonts by using native fonts in PGraphics2
   1 _   especially textMode(SCREEN) which is disastrously slow
   1 _   in java2d, can quickly blit the image itself
   1 _   this way, can isolate it for gl too, which will use glBitmap
   1 _   danger of this setup is that it may run much nicer for the author
   1 _     i.e. with the font installed, and then super slow for their users
     _ not having kerning really blows
     _   could this be pulled from the OpenType font stuff? 
     _   it could be placed at the end of the file
     _ not having fractional widths on small fonts really blows
     _   screen space text looks crappy


CORE / PSound

   1 _ make java 1.1 version of PSound work properly
   1 _ merge PSound and PSound2 via reflection?
   1 _   once debugged, merge these back together and use reflection
   1 _     (unless it's a messy disaster)


CORE / PApplet

   1 _ framerate(30) is still flickery and jumpy..
   1 _ fix param() to use a sketch.properties file when run as an app
   1 _   make this also be used in generating the html file
   1 _ fix link() to handle relative URLs
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081710684;start=0
   1 _ put SecurityException things around file i/o for applets
   1 _   rather than checking online(), since applets might be signed
   1 _ saveFrame() at the end of a draw mode program is problematic
   1 _   app might exit before the file has finished writing to disk
   1 _   need to block other activity inside screenGrab until finished
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081706752
   1 _ problems with defining fill(255) vs fill(0xff808080)

   1 _ too many push() will silently stop the applet inside a loop
   1 _ test winding polygons in different directions
   1 _ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
   1 _ better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
   1 _ is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
   1 _   may be correct, it worked for nik
   1 _ inside draw() mode, delay() does nothing
   1 _   delay might be a good way to signal drawing to the screen/updating
   1 _ catch security exceptions around applet i/o calls
   1 _   not just for saving files, but provide better error msgs when
   1 _     attempting to download from another server
   1 _ array utilities on Object[] are worthless.. fix it with reflection?
   1 _   see if reflection will allow expand for all class types
   1 _ ed's thread re: fullscreen strategies
   1 _   could add a new BApplet that uses BufferStrategy?

CORE / Documentation

   1 _ write documentation on general use of processing.core
   1 _   along with how to download from sourceforge (anonpass is blank)
   1 _   note that applet is itself a Component


CORE / Mac OS X

   b _ still some weirdness with thread flickering on the mac
   b _   and frenetic display updates on the pc
   b _ little window showing up on macosx when running
   b _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081284410
   b _ flicker happening on osx java 1.4, but not 1.3:
   b _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083184297;start=0
   b _ cursor() broken in applets on macosx?
   b _   or is it a java 1.4 versus java 1.3 problem?
