			To learn the Processing language, we recommend you try a few of the examples, 
			and check out the <A HREF="http://processing.org/reference/">reference</A>. 
			<br> <br>
			When using the examples (or trying someone else's code), 
			if you run across a function that you're not familiar with, 
			highlight the word, right-click (ctrl-click on the mac), 
			and select "Find in Reference" to open the reference page
			for that keyword. This can be helpful for understanding how
			programs work.
			<br> <br>
			In the past, there was a tutorials page on the site, however we ran
			      out of time to properly maintain it, and the information was
			      incomplete and sometimes wrong. Casey is currently working on a book
			      that will be written for people without any experience or
			      background programming computers and discusses programming in
			      relation to the arts.

			      <br>
			The Processing development environment is released as open source

			released under an LGPL license, which means they can be used 
			      as a library and included in your project without you having to open up 
			      your code (though we encourage people to share anyway). But if
			      you make changes to core, you have to submit back to us. 
			More information about the GNU Public License can be found at <A
			      HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</A>.
			<br> <br>
			Processing also relies on other open projects, namely:
			<UL>
			<LI>the older <A
			HREF="http://www.savarese.org/oro/">ORO Matcher</A>, 
			distributed under a BSD-style license as part of the 
			<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache Jakarta</a> project
			<LI>the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jikes/">Jikes</A>
			compiler, which is covered by the 
			<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ipl.html">
			IBM Public License</A>.
			<LI>the <A HREF="http://syntax.jedit.org">jEdit Syntax</A> package,
			which is public domain
			<LI>com.ice.jni.registry from the <a href="http://www.gjt.org/">Giant
			Java Tree</a> (GPL license) 
			<LI>perhaps others but that's all I can think of right now while we're
			cramming for the beta release
			</UL>
			The source code is stored on our <A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/">developer site</A>, and more
			information about its use can be found over there.
			<br> <br>
			We need help! Having shared all the code and made it available for
			free, doesn't it just make you want to pitch in? We have too much work

			This is not 1.0 software.. It's buggy and may kill people. That's part

			getting into.
			<br> <br>
			At least until the final 1.0 version, we'll be using four digit

			which means that all the features are in, but not all the bugs
			are out. There remain several known issues with the beta release 
			that will need to be sorted out before we're comfortable calling 
			a release an actual final 1.0.
			<br> <br>

			      <b>Why is it called &ldquo;Processing&rdquo;?</b><br>
			      <br>
			      At their core, computers are processing machines. They modify, move, and 
			      combine symbols at a low level to construct higher level representations. 
			      Our software allows people to control these actions and representations 
			      through writing their own programs. The project also focuses on
			      the &ldquo;process&rdquo; 
			      of creation rather than end results. The design of the software supports 
			      and encourages sketching and the website presents fragments of projects 
			      and exposes the concepts behind finished software. 
			      <br> <br>
			&ldquo;Proce55ing&rdquo; is the spelling we originally used for the url. Even 
			though it's a combination of numbers and letters, it was simply
			pronounced &ldquo;processing.&rdquo; We saved our pennies and had a can
			drive so now we've since acquired the processing.org domain name. 
			As a result we are no longer using the name &ldquo;Proce55ing.&rdquo;
			When we see it with the 55's it annoys us and we want to punch people 
			in the face. Or punch ourselves in the face for using it 
			in the first place. Actually, we try not to be that emotional about it
			      but we're trying to kill off the previous naming. However, to
			      make it more confusing, we sometimes still use &ldquo;p5&rdquo;
			      (not p55) as a shortened version of the name.

			What is the sketchbook? What do you mean by sketches?
			      </b><br><br>
			We think most &ldquo;integrated development environments&rdquo; 
			(Microsoft Visual Studio, Codewarrior, Eclipse, etc.) tend to be
			overkill for the type of audience we're targeting with Processing. For
			this reason, we've introduced the 'sketchbook' which is a more lightweight 
			way to organize projects. As trained designers, we'd like the process 
			of coding to be a lot more like sketching. The sketchbook setup, and
			the idea of just sitting down and writing code (without having
			to write two pages to set up a graphics context, thread, etc) is
			a small step towards that goal. 
			<br> <br>
			The idea of just writing a short piece of code that runs very easily
			(via a little run button) is a direct descendant of John Maeda's work
			in <A HREF="http://dbn.media.mit.edu">Design By Numbers</A>, and 
			our experiences maintaining it. 
			(Yes, other languages and environments have done this first,
			but in our case, the concept is drawn from DBN).

			Why Java? Or why such a Java-esque programming language?
			      </b><br><br>
			We didn't set out to make the ultimate language for visual
			programming, we set out to make something that was:
			<OL>
			<LI> a sketchbook for our own work, simplifying the majority 
			   of tasks that we undertake, 
			<LI> a teaching environment for that kind of process, and
			<LI> a point of transition to more complicated or difficult 
			languages like full-blown Java or C++ (a gateway drug to 
			more geekier and more difficult things)
			</OL>
			At the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and
			simplicity of use. i.e. if we didn't care about speed, Python, Ruby
			or many other scripting languages would make far more sense
			(especially for the simplicity and education aspect of it). 
			If we didn't care about transition to more advanced languages, 
			we'd get rid of the crummy C-style (well, algol, really) syntax. 
			etc etc.
			<br> <br>
			Java makes a nice starting point for a sketching language because it's
			far more forgiving than C++ and also allows users to export sketches for
			distribution via the web. 
			<br> <br>
			Processing is not intended as the ultimate environment/language (in
			fact, the language is just Java, but with a new graphics and 
			utility API along with some simplifications). Fundamentally, 
			Processing just assembles our experience in building things, 
			and trying to simplifies the parts that we felt should be easier.

			should bother competing with a company as large as Macromedia?
			Macrodobe? Does anyone really want a better Flash? 
			 <br> <br>
			There are things that are always going to be better in Flash,
			and other types of work that will always be better in Processing. But
			fundamentally (and this cannot be emphasized enough), there is no
			all-or-nothing game&hellip; We're talking about tools. Do people refuse
			to use pencils because pens exist? No, you just use them for different
			things, and for specific reasons. If Processing works for you, then
			use it. If not, don't. It's easy! It's free! You're not being forced
			to do anything.
			 <br> <br>
			As we have heard, Flash 8 will be better at doing some of the pixel
			editing/image stuff you can do in Processing, but there are still lots
			of things we're covering that's not focused on moving pixels (OpenGL
			acceleration, easy serial port access, video input) and other things
			that are incomplete in beta but just around the corner ("Export to
			Application" and more).

			Why Is Processing Connecting to the Network?
			      </b><br><br>
			After you double-click Processing, it will check the site for
			      updates. This is helpful so that we can keep people
			      aware of the frequent updates to Processing. 
			<br> <br>
			In so doing, it also sends a random number that identifies yours as a
			      unique machine (but sends no personal information to us). 
			This really helps us get a general idea of how many people are using the
			      software, which is really important for things like
			      writing grants so that we can keep Processing free.
			<br> <br>
			If the network connection causes you trouble, it can be shut off
			inside the Preferences window.
