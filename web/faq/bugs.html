			I've found a bug! 
			      </b><br><br>
			<em>I know you're excited, but please avoid the urge to just email
			      us!</em> especially sending mail to Ben or Casey directly. This
			      includes sending us "Instant Messages" on the discourse section
			      of the site. While you may prefer the privacy of a personal
			      message, it's much quicker for
			      you to write to the board, where you'll find all sorts of
			      helpful people who are also often at all hours of the night. If you
			      email us directly, we'll either not respond or just ask you to
			      use the discourse board anyway.
			<br> <br>
			<em>We spend a lot of
			      our time helping people with Processing, so reading and
			      following these instructions means that you respect our time and
			      don't want to waste it.</em>
			<br> <br>
			First, read the FAQ. Start with digging through this page and maybe
			      the <A HREF="platforms.html">platforms</A> page too in case it's
			      something specific to your operating system. 
			<br> <br>
			Second, search the <a href="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">bug
			database</a> to see if your problem has already been reported. 
			Most often, this will contain background on the bug, a workaround, 
			or hopefully a bit about its status. The bug database is unfortunately
			      incomplete so it doesn't cover everything, but it will get
			      better with time.
			<br> <br>
			If you don't find your bug, enter it as a new bug in
			the database, which we use to keep track of things. If you're having
			      trouble or find it confusing (or the word "database" gives you
			      the willies), please post on the
			      discourse board so that we can get you straightened out.
			<br> <br>
			When reporting please include information about
			<OL>
			<LI> the revision number (i.e. 0085)
			<LI> what operating system you're using, and on what kind of hardware
			<LI> a copy of the smallest possible piece of code that will
			   produce the error you're having trouble with
			<LI> details of the error, either the red spew that you see in the
			console, or the last few lines from the files stdout.txt or stderr.txt 
			from the 'lib' folder. 
			</OL>
			For stranger errors during compile time, you can also look inside the
			build folder which contains an intermediate (translated into
			java) version of your code. The build folder is in the same location
			as preferences.txt: <br>
			<UL>
			<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
			Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; build
			<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; 
			Processing &rarr; build
			<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; build
			</UL>
			The more details you can post, the better, because it helps us figure
			out what's going on. Useful things when reporting:
			<UL>
			<LI> We want the minimum amount of code that will still replicate the
			  bug. The worst that can happen is we get a report with a subject
			  saying "problem!" along with a three page program. 
			  Sure, everyone likes a puzzle, but simpler code will receive a 
			  faster response. 
			<LI> Occasionally we may need you to pack up a copy of your sketch folder 
			  or something similar so that we can try and replicate the weirdness 
			  on our own machine. Rest assured, we have no interest in messing with
			  your fancy creations or stealing your ideas. The Processing team is
			  a pair of straight-laced boys who hail from the midwestern U.S. who 
			  were brought up better than that. and as we often lack enough time to
			  build our own projects, we have even less time to spend figuring out
			  other peoples' projects to rip them off.

			Windows
			<UL>
			<LI>If you're using the "without Java" download, try downloading the version that includes Java. Chances are, your machine has Java 1.5 installed, which is <A HREF="platforms#java">not supported</A> and causes lots of headaches. For instance, it won't play nice with some graphics cards and causes the Processing window to come up mostly blank.
			<LI> Processing seems to have trouble starting when run from a user 
			account that contains non-ascii characters. For instance, if your name 
			contains Japanese characters or umlauts, it's likely to have trouble. 
			Sometimes using run.bat instead will fix this. Another fix is to
			create a user account that uses only ascii characters. In the meantime, 
			we're looking for a fix. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49">Bug 49</A>)
			<!-- <LI> In general, Processing probably won't work if you install it inside
			  a folder with non-ascii characters in its name. For instance, if the
			  name of your user folder includes Japanese characters, 
			or it has an umlaut or cedilla or anything else fancy, you're gonna
			  have trouble. The same sometimes happens when Processing is on the 
			desktop, or somewhere inside that folder. The fix
			  to place processing inside the root level of your C:\ drive (or
			  whatever drive you use) and it'll be ok again. This will be fixed in
			  the future.
			-->
			<LI>If you have lots of garbage in your CLASSPATH environment
			  variable, that might cause trouble starting up a sketch. You might
			  get "Couldn't find package xxx.xxx" errors. Clean things up by avoiding
			  spaces and quotes. This is because of Windows' awesome
			  hokiness and its not-as-distant-as-it-should-be ancestor DOS. In the
			  future, we'd like to detect errors like this before they cause
			  trouble. That issue is being tracked at <A
			  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=112">Bug 112</A>.
			<LI>You might also try using run.bat to start processing. Lots
			  of people seem to have a better time with this method.
			<LI>If you're still having trouble, try disabling any overly
			  protective virus scanning software. It might be holding things up,
			  especially when libraries have been imported.
			</UL>
			Mac OS X
			<UL>
			<LI>If you're running on Mac OS X 10.2, read the <a href="platforms.html#mac">platforms</a> section regarding things that may be broken.
			<LI>Sometimes you might see the following error: <br>
			<TT>dyld: /Applications/processing/jikes version mismatch for library:<br>/sw/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version of user: <br>
			5.0.0 greater than library's version: 3.0.0)</TT> <br>
			It seems that this happens when an older version of <a
			  href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</A> is installed. In this
			  case, you should either update or uninstall Fink. (thanks to ryan govostes for tracking this down)
			</UL>
			Linux
			<UL>
			<LI>If you get an error reading <TT>jikes: error while loading 
			shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: 
			No such file or directory</TT>,
			It's because Processing requires libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 for jikes. 
			You should either install it or, since it's old, install the rpm/package 
			for compat-libstdc++ before Processing will run. Or find/rebuild a different 
			version of jikes that's compatible with your distro. Jikes is available 
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128803">here</a>, and it's an easy ./configure, make, and then copy src/jikes to the 
			processing-XXXX folder and you should be all set. (<A
			HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=47">Bug 47</A>)

			<LI>Or if you encounter a problem like this one: <TT>jikes: relocation

			Export and Browser Troubles
			</b> <br> <br>
			Sketches (applets) often have trouble once exported that will cause
			errors in a browser. <br> <br>
			To figure out what your problem is, you should first check the Java
			(not JavaScript!) console. On Windows, right-click the coffee cup at
			the right of the task bar, and select "Open Console". On Mac OS X, go
			to Applications &rarr; Utilities &rarr; Console and see what the last
			few error messages were.
			<BR> <BR>
			The most common cause is a security issue. Java applets aren't allowed
			to do things like the following:
			<UL>
			<LI>Applets cannot open or write to files on the local machine. So
			things like saveFrame() will cause an error when run from an
			applet. To read files, make sure that you use "Add File..." to add the
			file to your sketch (or place it in the data folder yourself) so that
			it will be included when exported. Then, only use functions like
			loadStrings(), loadImage(), openStream(), etc. to read data from your file.
			<LI>Applets may only connect to servers other than the one from which
			they came. If you need to redirect things from another server, you can
			write a short script that will do it, understanding the possible
			security consequences for your own machine.
			<LI>They're also not allowed to do things like capture video or
			audio. You don't want a malicious applet that turns on your webcam and
			starts sending things back to their server.
			</UL>
			Other common problems:
			<UL>
			<LI>Another common problem is placing images or files into the sketch
			folder by hand, rather than placing them in the data folder (or using
			"Add File..." to do so automatically). This will work from the
			PDE, but on export, the files won't be in included with your sketch
			because they're not in the data folder.
			<LI>Watch out for issues with capitalization! Windows and Mac OS don't
			care about capitalization, so "blah.JPG" looks just the same as
			"blah.jpg". However, since most servers run on Unix, capitalization
			becomes a huge problem, because it must be exact. We've added some
			checks to try and catch this (at least for images) but they're not
			perfect. This can especially be a problem when the .JPG extension is
			not even visible (the default on Windows), so you don't know whether
			it's upper or lower case.
			<LI>Your browser may be using an old version of an
			applet. Unfortunately it's often difficult to get your browser to
			flush its cache. You
			may need to quit all instances of the browser, use alt-reload (or ctrl
			or shift or option, who knows) to get the new version to show
			up. On Windows, clicking the Java coffee cup at the right of the task
			bar can bring up a control panel that will let you flush the Java
			cache too. This is different across all platforms, but if someone
			wants to write a good explanation for any platform they're familiar
			with, please post on the <A
			HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/">discourse</A> area of the site
			and we'll add it to the FAQ.
			</UL>
			Some libraries simply don't work with the web (at least not for now):
			<UL>
			<LI>You cannot use the OpenGL library from the web. (<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=166">Bug 166</A>)
			<LI>The video library (both Capture and Movie) cannot be used on the
			web

			Issues with "Export to Application"
			</b> <br> <br>
			The "Export to Application" is implemented as of release 0097 but has
			not been heavily tested. If you find problems, 
			<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">file a bug</A>.
			<UL>
			<LI>Just like when exporting as an applet, the "application.xxxx"
			folders will be removed completely on export.
			<LI>It is important that you don't have a method named main() in your
			sketch, unless you know what you're doing (writing your own
			main). Otherwise this will fool the preprocessor into thinking you
			have a clue, when in fact you don't.
			<LI>If running in "Java" mode, where your code starts "public class
			blah extends PApplet", you'll need to write your own main() method in
			order for Export to Application to work. It should look something like this:
			<PRE>
			static public void main(String args[]) {
			  PApplet.main(new String[] { "YourClassName" });
			}
			</PRE>
			Not doing this, or using your own main can cause problems internally
			with variables not being properly set up. If you opt not to use
			PApplet.main(), make sure you read the source code for it so that you
			understand how it works, and don't whine if it breaks.
			<LI>To make an exported application run in "present" mode, you'll have 
			to write your own main(). It needs to look something like this:
			<PRE>
			static public void main(String args[]) {
			  PApplet.main(new String[] { "--display", "YourClassName" });
			}
			</PRE>
			Other advanced options can be read in the 
			<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/reference/core/javadoc/processing/core/PApplet.html#main(java.lang.String[])">developer's reference</A> for main(). In a future release, this will be part of an export options dialog.
			<LI>The "Movie" and "Capture" examples do not yet work properly, this
			will be fixed shortly. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=230">Bug 230</A>)
			<LI>Exporting sketches that use the video library may be broken, it's
			not clear the extent of this issue (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=231">Bug
			231</A>), but it will be repaired for a future release. 
			<LI>Export to Application will create sketches for Windows, Mac OS X,
			and Linux. Someday we might implement a dialog box that lets you
			select which one you actually want, but for now, enjoy the bounty.
			<LI>When exporting for Mac OS X from Windows, be sure to read through
			the readme.txt file in the application.macosx folder&mdash;your
			application likely won't work on Mac OS X without a minor
			modification.
			<LI>The Mac OS X export is a nice .app bundle like a regular OS X
			application. You can change the icon or edit its settings by using
			"Show Package Contents" and editing Info.plist or replacing
			sketch.icns with something more exciting.
			<LI>Windows is a shell .exe that calls the code and requires the "lib"
			folder along with it be kept intact. Someday we might make Windows be
			a nice single .exe file, but this requires more time to implement, and
			more specifically, make work consistently with the libraries. If
			you're finicky about this, use a Java EXE generator such as <A
			HREF="http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/">JSmooth</A> or <A
			HREF="http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/">launch4j</A>.
			<LI>To set the icon used on the title bar for Windows, use the
			following code: (submitted by dxtx)
			<PRE>
			ImageIcon titlebaricon = new ImageIcon(loadBytes("myicon.gif"));
			frame.setIconImage(titlebaricon.getImage());
			</PRE>
			Note that within the PDE, the icon will only show up when a code 
			folder is in use or a library has been imported. However, it should
			show up on all occasions when exported to an application.
			<LI>Linux is just a shell script, which can probably be used on most
			Unix platforms (there's almost nothing to it). 
			<LI>When distributing your application, the "source" folder can be
			removed from the export if you'd like, but other files (such as the
			lib folder and any .dll files or whatever) should be left intact
			otherwise the application may not work properly.
			<LI>If you just want an executable jar file, export as an
			applet. Executable jar files will most likely not work with
			libraries because the path information will not be properly set, and
			the additional library jars won't be referenced. 
			<LI>Library writers can now specify what files to export for each
			platform, see the update libraries/howto.txt for more information.
			<LI>Your current memory settings will be exported with the
			application. If you've set outrageous memory requirements, you might
			want to undo that before exporting for others, or edit the exported
			files by hand (Contents/Resources/Info.plist on Mac OS X and
			lib/args.txt on Windows).
			<LI>If you want to replace (or add) titlebar text, just do this in
			setup():
			<PRE>
			frame.setTitle("This is in the titlebar!"); </PRE>
			(thanks dxtx for pointing this out)
			<LI>Holding down shift while clicking "Export" on the toolbar will
			export to application instead of an applet.
			<LI>Users must still have Java installed to use your exported
			application. You can also copy the "java" folder from Processing to
			the same folder as your app so that users needn't install their own
			Java (this is the same as the "standard" version of processing), or
			you want to ensure that a certain version of the VM is used. For the
			time being, the error message when Java is installed may be
			nonexistant or cryptic. 
			<LI>Someday we'll also add features like icon files and whatnot. Or at
			least a default icon for the exported stuff. Or maybe even a splash
			screen while the VM is loading. Again, if you want more control, use
			your own application generator (see above for Windows, or use the Java
			package maker whatchamacallit on Mac OS X).

			Out Of Memory Errors
			</b> <br> <br>
			There are two types of programs in Processing. Some are run from
			inside the environment, but whenever you import a library, include a
			code folder, or use "Present" to view your sketch, it will be run
			as a separate Java program, which we sometimes call running "externally".
			<br> <br>
			To increase the amount of memory available to those programs, open
			your preferences.txt file and edit the run.options line to include
			something like:
			<PRE>-Xms128m -Xmx1024m</PRE>
			This will increase the amount of RAM to 128 megabytes of stack, and
			1024 megabytes of heap (the latter being effectively usable RAM).
			This will eventually be a setting that's added to the preferences
			window (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=233">Bug 233</A>).
			<br> <br>
			Depending on your OS and available RAM, there are limits on how much
			memory you can ask for. On Windows with 1G of RAM, it seems to be in
			the neighborhood of 1.5 GB. Mac OS X seems to be somewhat similar, but
			you mileage will vary with different versions of Java (1.3, 1.4,
			1.5). Unfortunately this does place an upper bound on things that is
			outside our control. You might look into the contributed Illustrator
			or SVG vector export libraries that can be found on the libraries page
			as another alternative for creating large format images.
			<br> <br>
			The preferences.txt file is stored in different locations on each
			platform:
			<UL>
			<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
			Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
			<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; 
			Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
			<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; preferences.txt
			</UL>
			To increase the amount of memory for Processing itself and for
			sketches that are not running externally: 
			<UL>
			<LI>On Windows, try adjusting the parameters in the file 'run.bat' and
			use that to run instead of Processing.exe. Short instructions can be
			found inside that file. It appears that the maximum amount of RAM that
			can be used on Windows is around 1.4 GB.
			<br> <br>
			<LI>On Mac OS X, right-click on Processing, select Show Package
			Contents, then edit "Info.plist" inside "Contents". Change these
			lines:
			<PRE>&lt;key&gt;VMOptions&lt;/key&gt;
			&lt;string&gt;-Xms128M -Xmx256M&lt;/string&gt;</PRE>
			to set to something higher than 128M and 256M (128 and 256 megabytes
			of ram) as you need to (and at your own risk).
			<br> <br>
			<LI>On Linux, adjust the Processing shell script as needed.

			Why don't these Strings equal? 
			</b> <br> <br>
			Comparing a string (quoted text) is different in Processing (Java) than it is in
			ActionScript, which often confuses people. For instance, while this
			might make sense:
			<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
			for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
			  if (lines[i] == "hello") { 
			    println("hello found on line: " + i); // you'll never see this
			  }
			}</PRE>
			You'll never see the message, even if "hello" is in the list. 
			This is because a String is an <em>object</em>
			in Java, comparing them with == will only compare whether the two
			things are pointing at the same memory, not their actual
			contents. Instead, use equals() or one of the other String methods:
			<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
			for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
			  if (<B>lines[i].equals("hello")</B>) {
			    println("hello found on line: " + i); // happiness
			  }

			Why does 2 / 5 = 0 instead of 0.4?
			</b> <br> <br>
			The result of dividing two integers will always be another integer:
			<PRE>int a = 2;
			int b = 5;
			int result = a / b;
			// result is zero</PRE>
			While somewhat confusing at first, this is later useful for more
			advanced programming. <BR> <BR>
			To get fractions, use a 'float' instead: 
			<PRE>float a = 2.0;
			float b = 5.0;
			float result = a / b;
			// result is 0.4</PRE>
			It is not enough to just divide two integers and set them to a float:
			<PRE>float y = 2 / 5;</PRE>
			In this case, integer 2 is divided by 5, which is zero, and then zero
			is assigned to a float. The number doesn't become a float until the
			lefthand side of the = sign. On the other hand, this:
			<PRE>float y = 2.0 / 5;</PRE>
			will work just fine. In this case, Java sees that 2.0 is a float, so
			it also converts the 5 to a float so that they can be divided, which
			makes it identical to:
			<PRE>float y = 2.0 / 5.0;</PRE>
			and because floats are being used on the righthand side, the result
			will be a float, even before it gets to the lefthand side.

			Common Issues (not bugs)
			</b> <br> <br>
			Things that are often perceived as bugs, but aren't actually 'broken'.

			<UL>
			<LI>If your code has methods (it's not just in static mode) or needs
			to run over time, it must have a draw() method, otherwise nothing will
			happen. 
			<LI> Names of sketches cannot start with a number, or have spaces
			  inside. this is mostly because of a restriction on the naming of
			  java classes. I suppose if lots of people find this upsetting, we
			  could add some extra code to unhinge the resulting class name from
			  the sketch name, but it adds complexity, and complexity == bugs. :)

			<LI>Mind the capitalization of built-in functions. If a method or variable 
			name is two words, usually the first word is lowercase and the first letter
			of the second word will be capitalized. For instance: keyPressed, movieEvent, mouseX, etc. If you have a function called mousepressed(), it won't be called when mouse events occur, because it needs the capital P on 'pressed'.

			<LI> If you get a "ClassCastException" when trying to run your code 
			  in a browser, you're probably trying to run non-Java 1.1 compliant 
			  code. This means any classes that didn't exist in java 1.1. Or, 
			  if if you're exporting as applet, variables that are 'final int' 
			  need to be 'static final int', otherwise they'll have trouble on 
			  a maching that only has Java 1.1 installed (i.e. running Microsoft's 
			  Java on Windows). You should also avoid using "final" variables 
			  <em>inside</em> of methods, since those aren't supported by 
			  Microsoft's VM (and that's the one most widely installed).

			<LI>On Mac OS X, the error message: 
			<tt>## Component Manager: attempting to find symbols in a component
			  alias of type (regR/carP/x!bt)</tt> 
			is not something from processing, it is a bug in Roxio Toast 5.2's Video
			  CD Support extension. To suppress the messages, move "Toast Video CD
			  Support.qtx" out of /Library/QuickTime (at least until you need to
			  do Video CD work).

			<LI>On Windows, sometimes your programs will run in a window that has a 
			  Java coffee cup icon, instead of the usual Processing icon. This 
			  simply means that the application is being run outside of Processing
			  as an external application. This happens when extra libraries, 
			  multiple source code files (more than one tab), or extra code files
			  in the 'code' folder are employed.

			<LI>mouseX and mouseY always even (or always odd) numbers? By default,
			Windows 2000 (and XP?) seems to skip every other pixel on the screen,
			causing weirdness for some drawing applications done with Processing.
			If you're seeing this, you can fix it by visiting Control Panels
			&rarr; Mouse &rarr; Pointer Options &rarr; Enhance pointer precision.
			(This was actually tracked down by someone else in the community,
			whose name I have misplaced. if it was you, please drop me a line so
			you can be properly cited. This kind of help is huge for us, since
			we're such a small group!)

			Problems with Video (Quicktime for Java)
			</b> <br> <br>
			The message "This version of QuickTime for Java has expired" is an Apple bug,
			and is fixed in the version of QuickTime that is included with iTunes
			6.0.1, or, as of 20 October 2005, is available separate from iTunes
			<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone.html">here</A>.
			<br> <br>
			The QuickTime 7 upgrade released April 29, 2005 (and now included with
			iTunes 6) has not been tested extensively with the video library. If
			you're using QuickTime 7, you'll need to use release 93 (or later) of 
			Processing, which fixed some issues related to QT7. 
			<B>If you're working on a
			critical project that uses video, do not install QuickTime 7 (or
			iTunes 6, which will install QuickTime 7), as there are likely
			problems with QuickTime for Java</B>. On Mac OS X, Apple has provided a
			QuickTime 6.5.2 reinstallers for <a
			href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652reinstallerforquicktime701.html">QuickTime
			7.0.1</a> and <a
			href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652reinstallerforquicktime70.html">QuickTime
			7.0</A> that you can use to return to your previous configuration. If you're using QuickTime 7.0.3, use this <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime701reinstallerforquicktime703.html">QuickTime 7.0.1 reinstaller</A> and then run the QuickTime 6.5.2 reinstaller for QuickTime 7.0.1. If
			you're on Windows (or another version), check the Apple <A
			HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/">downloads</A> area to
			see if there's a reinstaller that supports your platform.
			<br> <br>
			Follow-ups on issues related to problems with QuickTime 7 should
			happen in the bugs database, see the separate entries for <A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=172">Mac OS X</A>

			<UL>

			<!--
			<LI>You must make sure that "QuickTime for Java" is installed. To
			install it, you need to download it from <a
			href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">apple.com/quicktime/download</A>. If you install the version "with iTunes", there's a second
			  step. After the installation, go to Start Menu &rarr; QuickTime &rarr;
			  QuickTime Updater. When it runs, use the "Custom" install, scroll
			  down, and click the checkbox next to "QuickTime for Java" and then
			  install. If you install the version of QuickTime without iTunes,
			  you'll also need to use the "Custom" install, as outlined above. You
			  will also need to follow this process if you have already installed
			  QuickTime, and did not use the "Custom" or "Full" install.

			<LI>Tt appears that QuickTime 7 breaks Processing video because Apple has decided to move the location of some files (specifically qtjava.zip). Stick with Quicktime 6.5.2.
			-->

			<LI>In order for camera input to work, you'll need to install a
			QuickTime-compatible video digitizer (VDIG). Unfortunately, most
			cameras on Windows don't support QuickTime right off the bat, but
			we've had reasonable luck with <a
			href="http://www.vdig.com/WinVDIG/">WinVDIG</A>.

			<LI>If you're still having trouble, sometimes a full uninstall/reinstall 
			of Quicktime will do the trick. 

			        <LI>If you're having trouble with video examples crashing
			  processing or locking up your system, you should try placing the
			  processing folder into the root level of your C:\ drive, or at least
			  inside a set of folders that have no spaces in the name. We haven't
			  determined if this is a QuickTime for Java or Processing bug yet,
			  but it's been a problem for lots of people.

			<LI>Video sometimes likes to crash the application completely on
			  Windows. This seems to be due to problems with QuickTime for Java
			  (since we shouldn't be able to write code that crashes using
			  Java.. heh right), so these situations are probably outside of our
			  control.

			Mac OS X
			<UL>
			<LI>On Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar, or Jagwyre if you like black turtlenecks),
			QuickTime for Java was missing from the initial release of QuickTime
			6.4. An upgrade to QuickTime 6.4 that includes QuickTime for Java is
			available from software update. Better yet, you might also upgrade to Mac
			OS X 10.3 (Panther) which doesn't have this problem.
			<LI>If you get the following error:
			<tt>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
			  com/apple/mrj/macos/carbon/CarbonLock</tt>
			then it means you need to update and/or reinstall QuickTime. There
			  was some monkey business about QuickTime for Java updates being out
			of sync with the Apple's Java updates, and this is one of the leftovers
			of that scenario. Blame Apple. Blame Canada.
			</UL>

			Linux (or any other platform)
			<UL>
			<LI>The video library is only supported on Windows and Mac OS, because it relies on QuickTime for Java. There has been discussion of using other libraries (such as JMF) to bring support to Linux, search <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse">discourse</A> for more information.
			</UL>

			Windows and Mac OS
			<UL>
			<LI>Video performance is not particularly great. The library is simply not built (and Java is not currently capable) of moving around 640x480 video on most machines, much less doing analysis on the video. The library was intended as a way to get pixels and manipulate them (either small pixel buffers interactively, or large ones for non real-time use). There are better tools for real-time, large screen analysis. It is my estimate that a 2x performance increase can probably be obtained by making better use of the QuickTime for Java library, but this still won't be enough to do analysis of 640x480 pixels at 30 frames per second, so it remains a lower priority. As always <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/">contributions are welcome</A>, in case you're a video hacker who wants to help improve the library. (<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=40">Bug 40</A>)

			Using the Serial Port

			All Platforms
			<UL>
			<LI>If you're using a program to check to see if the serial port is working, then it won't be available to Processing.

			We use <a href="http://rxtx.org">rxtx</A> (version 2.1_6) to handle
			serial I/O, which is included with the Processing release. If this is
			the first time you're using rxtx, you'll need to make your way to the
			"libraries" folder, find "serial", and inside, and run
			macosx_setup.command (double-click it and follow the instructions).
			This will make sure that things are properly set up (a few permissions
			need to be changed). 
			<LI>If you're getting a "serial port is already in
			use by another application" it's possible that you haven't run this
			script. On my machine, I installed the keyspan driver for my
			usb-serial converter, ran the script, and then rebooted in order for

			keyspan 28X dual port adapter, and Serial.list() returns things like
			<tt>/dev/cu.USA28X21P1.1</tt>. You'll probably have something
			similar. Don't mind the frightening names.
			<LI>Tom Igoe was kind enough to note that you'll be in a world of hurt
			if you disconnect your serial adapter while a sketch is
			running&mdash;it'll prolly freeze the machine and require a forced
			reboot. This scenario may seem unlikely, but you might run into it if
			your adapter is plugged into a USB keyboard, and you have the
			keyboard plugged into a monitor/keyboard switcher.
			<LI>The OS X 10.4 (Tiger) installer wipes out your permissions and groups

			again. However, running it returns:
			<BR> <BR>
			<TT>check_group_uucp(): error testing lock file    creation Error
			details: Permission deniedcheck_lock_status: No permission to create

			Tom Igoe's extremely technical solution: &ldquo;After you have run the
			macosx_setup.command, Shut down the machine and restart. <BR> <BR>
			&ldquo;Don't logout then log back in.  Don't just restart.  Shut down and restart.  I don't care that you've got a record uptime you're trying to preserve. SHUT DOWN AND RESTART! Don't be an idiot like I was.  This will free up the old lock files, which apparently carry over from the previous systems, and your serial devices will be happy.

			<LI>Linux also uses rxtx-2.1_6 (just like Mac OS X). If you're 
			having trouble getting things to run, i.e. the port menu stays grayed 
			out or you get error message spew to the console when starting the 
			application saying "Permission denied" and "No permission to create 
			lock file", this is because you probably need 
			to add yourself to both the uucp or lock groups so that processing 
			can write to /var/lock so it doesn't get in a fight with other 
			applications talking on the serial port. 
			<LI>Alan Kilian contributes this description:
			<OL>
			<LI> I did an ls -l /dev/ttyS0 and saw that the group was set to uucp.
			<LI> Then I edited /etc/groups, I found the uucp group, and I added my 
			   login ID to the uucp line.
			<LI> I logged out, and logged back in again.
			<LI> The "groups" command now showed I was in group uucp, and when I 
			   started processing, the serial port menu item was not greyed-out.
			</OL>
			It's important that you're in both groups, and that you completely
			log out and log back in again.
			<LI>Running processing as root will often get rid of the errors, but
			that's obviously not a good solution for a million reasons (among 
			them: beta code that runs as root and handles files? yeah great...)

			OpenGL Issues
			</b> <br> <br>
			<UL>
			<LI>We don't recommend running other OpenGL programs while running
			  Processing in OpenGL mode. GL tends takes charge of things so
			  results will be unexpected (windows from the other app showing
			  through to the Processing window, etc.)

			<LI>Objects with alpha (lines or shapes with an alpha fill or stroke, images with alpha, all fonts) are displayed in OpenGL based on their drawing order. This creates some annoying effects like making things opaque if they're drawn out of order with objects above or beneath them. This is simply how OpenGL works, but is something that we'd like to develop a workaround for in the future. Currently, you should just try to draw things back-to-front as best as possible.

			<LI>OpenGL is really memory hungry because of how tetxures work. In
			OpenGL mode, your images as the next power of two larger in either
			direction. This means an image that's 40x190 pixels will be stored as
			a 64x256 pixel x 4 bytes per pixel array (along with the original
			image storage being width x height x 4). This is probably something we
			can optimize in the future, however no attempt will be made until the
			surrounding code is debugged. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150">Bug 150</A>)

			<LI>OpenGL sketches cannot be exported to run in a browser. The export
			probably won't give an error, but they won't run properly. It's not
			clear whether this is something that we can fix for the future.

			<LI>OpenGL requires Java 1.4 or later. 

			<LI>If you're getting a blank screen or strange graphics on Windows, 
			try messing with your graphics card settings (or even with a different
			graphics card). There are lots of options that can cause trouble (if
			you run into such a situation, please post to the board on how you got
			it fixed).

			<LI>If you're getting this error on Windows: 
			<tt>"net.java.games.jogl.GLException: Unable to enumerate pixel formats 
			  of window using wglGetPixelFormatAttribivARB: 0"</tt>
			and your machine has built in "Intel" graphics (this is the case for 
			  many Dell machines, for instance) you may just need an updated version 
			  of your driver, which can be found 
			<a href="http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df/Detail_Desc.asp?sType=prev&agr=N&ProductID=865&DwnldID=7919">here</a>. 
			Of course, read the page closely and make sure that you in fact have
			this graphics chipset on your machine before installing. Thanks to
			Daniel Shiffman for finding this fix.

			<LI><STRIKE>On Mac OS X, I don't think there's much we can do about the
			  following error: <tt>Error: view not ready, cannot lock focus at 
			  "/Users/kbr/JavaNet/jogl/src/native/jogl/
			   MacOSXWindowSystemInterface.m:createContext:51"</tt>
			  that shows up sometimes on Run. Just hit Run again and things oughta
			  work. This may be our bug, but who knows.</STRIKE> "Cannot lock
			  focus" bug on OS X is fixed for Processing release 93, thanks to
			  toxi for tracking it down as fixed with a new JOGL release.

			<LI> On Windows, if you're getting a lot of OpenGL crashing, blue
			screens, or other mess, your driver might be bad. For instance, if
			you're using a Dell, use the driver they provide (<a
			href="http://support.dell.com">support.dell.com</a>) instead of what
			might be a more recent driver obtained directly from nvidia.com.

			<LI>To get access to the GL object, you can use the following:
			<PRE>GL gl = ((PGraphicsGL)g).gl;</PRE>
			This will give you the <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/">jogl</a> 
			object that talks directly to OpenGL and will let you make OpenGL 
			calls directly. Note, however, that <em>this is not supported</em>, 
			in the sense that if you get weird problems with a GL-based sketch
			that uses this method, you're on your own. Processing is not intended
			as a nice wrapper on top of OpenGL. Instead, we're using 
			OpenGL graphics for one implementation of the Processing Core
			API. <BR> 
			Because most of the work in drawing is handled by Processing, most
			OpenGL calls will not work, because the model and perspective matrices
			won't be set up properly. Therefore, using the GL object will mostly
			only be useful for tweaking obscure OpenGL parameters.

			Things that we probably can't fix
			</b> <br> <br> 
			Some things are out of our control, or not actually bugs...
			<br> <br>

			All Platforms
			<UL>
			<LI>A long sketch menu that goes off the edge of the screen? Doesn't
			  scroll properly? There's not much we can do. This is a java issue which
			  happens on most platforms. To get around it, you can organize your
			  sketches into subfolders which will appear as submenus (be sure to
			  quit before reorganizing, and then restart when finished). 
			<LI>If you're seeing a <TT>sun.dc.pr.PRException</TT>, it's because
			  you're trying to draw something that's waaaaay off screen (like an x
			  coordinate of -100,000 or something nutty like that). (<A
			  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=104">Bug 104</A>)
			</UL>

			Windows
			<UL>
			<LI>The system clock sometimes goes weird, especially when
			  using framerate() or delay(). This is a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4500388">long-standing bug</a> with the
			  Windows version of the Java VM.
			  According to someone on the sun site: This bug has been fixed in 
			  bug no 4500388 and one requires a PRODUCT FLAG to use the fix.
			  This flag and fix are available in 1.3.1_4, 1.4.0_2, 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.
			  But for Java to actually use the fix: <br>
			  Open your Java Plug-in Control Panel in the section 'Java Runtime 
			  Parameters' just enter: -XX:+ForceTimeHighResolution
			<LI>Create Font sometimes crashes on Windows, bringing down the whole
			  environment. This seems to be a Java bug, because it's not a Java
			  exception, but a full crash. (<A
			  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=99">Bug 99</A>).
			<LI>An error starting with <tt>"hs_err_pid10XX.txt"</tt> 
			sometimes shows up. This is something within the Sun's Java VM that
			we can't fix. It's not clear what the problem is, but it seems to have
			shown up with java 1.4.
			</UL>
			Mac OS X
			<UL>
			<LI>
			An error that reads something like 
			<TT>2005-05-19 14:20:44.209 java[875] _initWithWindowNumber: error
			creating graphics ctxt object for ctxt:72059, window:26969</TT> is a
			known bug in Apple's Java implementation. (<A
			HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=53">Bug 53</A>)
			<LI>
			Sometimes something like the following will come up: <TT> ***
			malloc[438]: Deallocation of a pointer not malloced: 0xffffffff; This
			could be a double free(), or free() called with the middle of an
			allocated block; Try setting environment variable MallocHelp to see
			tools to help debug </TT> it seems to be a bug in Apple's OS X
			Java. It doesn't appear to hurt anything but there also doesn't appear
			to be anything we can do to fix it. (<A
			HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=52">Bug 52</A>)
			</UL>
			Linux
			<UL>
			<LI>The following message (or messages like it) on startup: 
			<tt>Warning: Cannot convert string
			"-b&h-lucida-medium-r-normal-sans-*-140-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1" to type
			FontStruct</tt>. This is just a Java issue, but doesn't seem to

			<UL>
			<LI>Java 1.1 support has been (temporarily) removed from this
			release. We hope to bring it back, but it will take some time and we
			didn't want to hold up beta any longer. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=125">Bug 125</A>)
			<LI>The stop button sometimes doesn't stop things properly (especially
			when using libraries). Closing the window to shut things down usually
			works fine, though even that might lock up sometimes. Make sure you
			save your sketches before you run, in case you have to force-quit. If
			this happens to you, please post information about it at <A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=126">Bug 126</A>.
			<STRIKE><LI> &ldquo;Export to Application&rdquo; remains unimplemented, 
			though we're hoping to have it complete soon. (<A
			HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=60">Bug
			60</A>)</STRIKE> Export to Application works in 0097.
			<LI>The get(), set(), blend(), loadPixels() and updatePixels() 
			functions are fairly broken when using OpenGL. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=91">Bug 91</A>)
			<LI>The size of exported applets is larger than we would like, but
			we'll get things smaller and more optimize again. Having separated the
			2D and 3D libraries, eventually we won't have to include the 3D code
			when using 2D. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=127">Bug 127</A>).
			<LI><STRIKE>println() can be super slow and often locks things
			up</STRIKE> println() issues fixed for Processing release 93.
			<LI><STRIKE>Dragging the applet window around will often make
			Processing lock up</STRIKE> Fixed in a recent release.
			<LI>2D graphics might be a bit flickery sometimes, try setting the
			framerate() to get things under control (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=122">Bug 122</A>)
			<LI>strokeWeight() is disabled in P3D and OPENGL. Not really a bug
			per se (how do you define a stroke in 3D?), but something we'd like to
			fix someday. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=123">Bug 123</A>)
			<LI>The placement of applets that are 100x100 is sometimes weird. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=128">Bug 128</A>)
			<LI><STRIKE>Sometimes things lock up when there are errors in code,
			for instance, when using libraries like OpenGL, video, or
			net.</STRIKE> (fixed in the early 90s releases, please re-file a bug
			if you run into it)
			<LI><STRIKE>Errors sometimes don't come through, or are
			InvocationTargetExceptions, particularly on the Mac.</STRIKE> (if this
			hasn't been fixed please re-file a new bug)
			<LI>int() and float() don't always work, use ((int) blah) or ((float)
			blah) instead for the time being. or toInt(blah) and toFloat(blah). (<A
			HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4">Bug 4</A>)
			<LI>pause() and framerate() aren't working with the video library
			<LI>The beloved(?) "History" function from previous versions is
			missing. In the meantime, "Archive Sketch" might be useful. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71">Bug 71</A>)
			<LI>Need to complete the "Tools" menu, which will be a way for people
			to develop their own editor plug-ins. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=124">Bug 124</A>)
			<LI>When you have too many tabs, things get ugly (<A
			HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54">Bug 54</A>)
			<LI>Save changes before quitting needs a "Cancel" button. (<A
			HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=32">Bug 32</A>)
			<LI>Error messages after you hit Run are often too long to read or too
			weird to understand
			(<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=57">Bug 57</A>)
			<LI><STRIKE>updatePixels() seems to stink on the Mac. It can sometimes
			cause the screen to not update properly, or for video to contain weird
