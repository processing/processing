      Processing Development Environment (PDE)</h5>
    <p>The Processing Development Environment (PDE) consists of a simple text 
      editor for writing code, a message area, a text console, tabs for managing 
      files, a toolbar with buttons for common actions, and a series of menus. 
      When programs are run, they open in a new window called the display window.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="images/ide.gif" height="294" width="600" alt="IDE screenshot"/> 
    </p>
    <p>Software written using Processing are called sketches. These sketches are 
      written in the text editor. It has features for cutting/pasting and for 
      searching/replacing text. The message area gives feedback while saving and 
      exporting and also displays errors. The console displays text output by 
      Processing programs including complete error messages and text output from 
      programs with the print() and println() functions. The toolbar buttons allow 
      you to run and stop programs, create a new sketch, open, save, and export:</p>

    <h5 id="Sketchbook"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Sketchbook</h5>
    <p>All Processing projects are called sketches. Each sketch has its own folder. The main program file for each
sketch has the same name as the folder and is found inside. For example, if the sketch is named
"Sketch_123", the folder for the sketch will be called "Sketch_123" and the main file will be called
"Sketch_123.pde". The PDE file extension is an acronym for the Processing Development Environment.</p>

<p>A sketch folder sometimes contains other folders for media files and code libraries. When a font or image is
added to a sketch by selecting "Add File..." from the Sketch menu, a "data" folder is created. Files may also
be added to your Processing sketch by dragging them into the text editor. Image and sound files dragged
into the application window will automatically be added to the current sketch's "data" folder. All images,
fonts, sounds, and other data files loaded in the sketch must be in this folder. Sketches are stored in the
Processing folder, which will be in different places on your computer or network depending if you use PC,
Mac, or Linux and how the preferences are set. To locate this folder, select the "Preferences" option from
the "File" menu (or from the “Processing” menu on the Mac) and look for the "Sketchbook location".</p>

<p>It is possible to have multiple files in a single sketch. These can be Processing text files (the extension .pde)
or Java files (the extension .java). To create a new file, click on the arrow button to the right of the file tabs.
This button gives access to creating, deleting, and renaming the files that comprise the current sketch. You
can write functions and classes in new PDE files and you can write any Java code in files with the JAVA
extension. Working with multiple files makes it easier to re-use code and to separate programs into small
sub-programs.</p>
   
    <h5 id="Coordinates"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Coordinates</h5>
    <p>Processing uses a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin in the upper-left 
      corner. If your program is 320 pixels wide and 240 pixels high, coordinate 
      [0, 0] is the upper-left pixel and coordinate [320, 240] is in the lower-right. 
      The last visible pixel in the lower-right corner of the screen is at position 
      [319, 239] because pixels are drawn to the right and below the coordinate.</p>
    <img src="images/coordinates.gif" height="170" width="300"><br>
    <p>Processing can also simulate drawing in three dimensions. At the surface 
      of the image, the z-coordinate is zero, with negative z-values moving back 
      in space. When drawing in simulated 3D, the "camera" is positioned in the 
      center of the screen.</p>
    <h5 id="Programming_modes"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Programming Modes</h5>
    <p>Processing allows people to program at three levels of complexity: Basic 
      Mode, Continuous Mode, and Java Mode. People new to programming should begin 
      with the Basic Mode to learn about coordinates, variables, and loops before 
      moving to Continuous and Java modes. </p>
    <h6>Basic</h6>
    <p>This mode is used drawing static images and learning fundamentals of programming. 
      Simple lines of code have a direct representation on the screen. The following 
      example draws a yellow rectangle on the screen:</p>
    <pre>size(200, 200);
background(255);
noStroke();
fill(255, 204, 0);
rect(30, 20, 50, 50);
</pre>
    <h6>Continuous</h6>
    <p>This mode provides a setup() structure that is run once when the program 
      begins and a draw() structure which by default continually loops through 
      the code inside. This additional structure allows writing custom functions 
      and classes and using keyboard and mouse events.<br>
      <br>
      This example draws four circles on the screen and utilizes a custom function 
      called circles(). The circles() function is not a part of the Processing 
      language, but was written for this example. The code in draw() only runs 
      once because noLoop() is called in setup().</p>
    <pre>void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
  noStroke();
  background(255);
  fill(0, 102, 153, 204);
  smooth();
  noLoop();
}

void draw()
{
  circles(40, 80);
  circles(90, 70);
}

void circles(int x, int y) {
  ellipse(x, y, 50, 50);
  ellipse(x+20, y+20, 60, 60);
}</pre>
    <p>This example draws rectangles that follow the mouse position (stored in 
      the system variables mouseX and mouseY). The<strong>draw()</strong> section 
      runs forever until the program is stopped, thus creating the potential for 
      motion and interaction.</p>
    <pre>void setup()
{
  size(200, 200);
  rectMode(CENTER);
  noStroke();
  fill(0, 102, 153, 204);
}
void draw()
{
  background(255);
  rect(width-mouseX, height-mouseY, 50, 50);
  rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}
</pre>
    <h6>Java</h6>
    <p>This mode is the most flexible, allowing complete Java programs to be written 
      from inside the Processing Environment. Writing in Java Mode removes the 
      limitations of the Processing Libraries and gives access to the full Java 
      programming language.</p>
    <pre>public class MyDemo extends PApplet {
  void setup()
  {
    size(200, 200);

    rectMode(CENTER);
    noStroke();
    fill(0, 102, 153, 204);
  }

  void draw()
  {
    background(255);
    rect(width-mouseX, height-mouseY, 50, 50);
    rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
  }
}
</pre>
    <h5 id="Rendering_modes"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Rendering Modes</h5>
    <p>Processing currently has three rendering modes. The programs written with 
      Processing can be rendered using the Java 2D drawing libraries, a custom 
      3D engine called P3D, and through OpenGL using the JOGL interface. The rendering 
      mode is specified through the size() function. A large effort has been made 
      to make the Processing language behave similarly across the different rendering 
      modes, but there are currently some inconsistencies.</p>
    <h6>JAVA2D</h6>
    <p>Utilizes the Java 2D graphics library for drawing 2D images. This is the 
      default rendering mode for Processing so if none is specified, it draws 
      in this way.</p>
    <pre>size(200, 200);
background(255);
noStroke();
fill(255, 204, 0);
rect(30, 20, 140, 160);</pre>
    <p>This renderer can be explicity called as shown in the example below.</p>
    <pre>size(200, 200, JAVA2D);
background(255);
noStroke();
fill(255, 204, 0);
rect(30, 20, 140, 160);
</pre>
    <h6>P3D</h6>
    <p>Optimized for fast 3D drawing, but also supports 2D:</p>
    <pre>size(200, 200, P3D);
background(0);
noStroke();
fill(204, 204);
translate(width/2, height/2);
rotateX(PI/6);
rotateY(PI/3);
rect(-60, -60, 120, 120);
</pre>
    <h6>OPENGL</h6>
    <p>This mode allows Processing programs to utilize the speed of an OpenGL 
      accelerated graphics card. This expands the potential for drawing more to 
      the screen and creating larger windows. Processing interfaces with OpenGL 
      through JOGL, an initiative from the Game Technology Group at Sun. You need 
      to have an OpenGL accelerated graphics card installed on your computer to 
      fully utilize this library. For more information, please visit the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/" target="_new">OpenGL</a> 
      and <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/" target="_new">JOGL</a> websites.</p>
    <p><em>Note: Software using this mode may appear different on varying graphics 
      cards as some cards support OpenGL better than others.</em></p>
    <pre>import processing.opengl.*;

void setup() 
{
  size(800, 600, OPENGL);
  noStroke();
}

void draw() 
{
  float x = mouseX - width/2;

  fill(0, 102, 153, 26);
  for(int i=0; i&lt;height; i+=10) {
    for(int j=0; j&lt;width; j+=10) {

      vertex(x+j,   i,    0);
      vertex(x+j, i+5,    0);
