	   <h5 id="alpha"><a href="#top"><img src="environment/images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> Changes between Alpha (Release 0069) and Beta (Release 0085)</h5>
       <p>Between revision 0069 (the last public alpha) and the beta release (0085), 
many, many functions have been added, and are detailed in the 
<a href="http://processing.org/reference/index_ext.html">complete
      reference</a>. Aside from that, this page lists functions whose
      names have changed or fundamental API differences between the
      two versions.
<UL>
<LI>loop() has been removed, and is instead called draw(). If you want
applications to only run draw() once (the way draw() used to work), 
use the function noLoop() inside of setup().
<LI>size() should now be the very first thing in your setup(),
otherwise commands that come before it may be ignored. your settings for 
fill() and stroke(), for instance, will disappear after you call size(). 
<LI>2D and 3D graphics are no longer completely mixed. To specify
3D graphics, instead of size(200, 200), the new way is to use
size(200, 200, P3D). 

<LI>BImage &rarr; PImage, BFont &rarr; PFont, and so on... 
<LI>For advanced users who were making their own BGraphics objects in
the previous release:
<PRE>BGraphics bg = new BGraphics(200, 200);
// has now become
PGraphics pg = new PGraphics2(200, 200, null);
pg.defaults(); // clear the buffer, get it ready</PRE>We didn't realize
quite how many people were using this, so we'll probably add a
createGraphics() method because PGraphics2 may be temporary (instead
of just PGraphics), and the "null" thing is pretty weird. Even still,
this isn't quite working as expected, but it's a high priority to fix
for the future, see <NOBR><A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=92">Bug 92</A></NOBR>
for the status.
<LI>The new renderers might be slower for some things, faster for others.
If you want faster pixel operations, try using P3D (until P2D is available
again). For high-quality lines and strokeWeight() and strokeCap(), use
JAVA2D (the default). 
<LI>To use OpenGL rendering, change that to size(200, 200, OPENGL),
and use Sketch &rarr; Import Library &rarr; opengl. OpenGL support is
incomplete, but allows for much larger screen sizes and accelerated
graphics that make use of a decent graphics card. 

<LI>When using the pixels[] array of the main window, or on an image,
you should first call loadPixels(), and once you're done editing, call
updatePixels(). This is because the new JAVA2D and OPENGL renderers both need to post-process the image data before displaying it, which is a time-consuming operation. 
<LI>Library events are handled differently because more than one
serial port or video input device can be used with Processing
beta. See the documentation for 
<a
href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/movieEvent_.html">movieEvent</a>, 
<a
href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/captureEvent_.html">captureEvent</a>, and
<a
href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/serial/serialEvent_.html">serialEvent</a>.
Documentation for clientEvent and serverEvent for network will also
eventually be linked from <a
href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/net/index.html">this page</a>.
<LI>push() &rarr; pushMatrix()
<LI>pop() &rarr; popMatrix()
<LI>textureMode(NORMAL_SPACE) &rarr; textureMode(NORMALIZED)

<LI>textureMode(IMAGE_SPACE) &rarr; textureMode(IMAGE)
<LI>textMode(ALIGN_LEFT) &rarr; textAlign(LEFT)
<LI>textMode(ALIGN_RIGHT) &rarr; textAlign(RIGHT)
<LI>textMode(ALIGN_CENTER) &rarr; textAlign(CENTER)
<LI>textSpace(SCREEN_SPACE) &rarr; textMode(SCREEN)
<LI>textSpace(OBJECT_SPACE) &rarr; textMode(MODEL)

<LI>font.width(String s) &rarr; textWidth(String s)
<LI>font.ascent() &rarr; textAscent()
<LI>font.descent() &rarr; textDescent()
<LI>fonts should now be more accurately sized, if your font sizing looks weird, try using "Create Font" to create a new font using the most recent release of Processing. It's strongly suggested that you do this when updated projects from alpha to beta. 
<LI>the function alpha(), when used to create an alpha mask of an image, is now <A HREF="../reference/PImage_mask_.html">mask()</A>, to remove a conflict with the alpha() function that extracts the alpha value of a color.
<LI>previous default was ellipseMode(CORNER) &rarr; now it's ellipseMode(CENTER)
<LI>RGBA for images &rarr; ARGB (more technically accurate)

<LI>CENTER_DIAMETER &rarr; CENTER
<LI>objectX, objectY, objectZ &rarr; modelX, modelY, modelZ
<LI>curveSegments() &rarr; curveDetail()
<LI>bezierSegments() &rarr; bezierDetail()
<LI>splitStrings() &rarr; split() (changed in rev 0069)
<LI>splitInts() &rarr; toInt(split()) (changed in rev 0069)

<LI>splitFloats() &rarr; toFloat(split()) (changed in rev 0069)
<LI>angleMode() has been removed. Radians are used for all functions. 
If you don't like radians, you can convert to radians to degrees via the radians() function, i.e.: sin(radians(90)).
<LI>four calls to bezierVertex(x, y) should instead be a single call
to vertex(x, y), followed by bezierVertex(cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2, x2, y2)
(two control points followed by the destination point). 
<LI>The libraries for serial, video, and network have changed
completely. Check out the examples or visit the <A HREF="../reference/libraries/index.html">libraries reference</A> for the full details.
<!--<LI>&hellip;anything else that we've forgotten in our hastiness and we'll be adding over the next few days and weeks. If you find something that we've missed, please <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=WebsiteBugs">let us know</A>.-->
