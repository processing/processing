<description>
Attempts to open an application or file using your platform's launcher. The <b>file</b> parameter is a String specifying the file name and location. When running sketches from the Processing environment the default location is the same folder as the Processing application itself. 
<br/> <br/>
It's also possible (and safer) to use a file's absolute path. Be sure to make the file executable before attempting to open it (chmod +x). 
<br/> <br/>
The <b>args</b> parameter is a String or String array which is passed to the command line. If you have multiple parameters, e.g. an application and a document, or a command with multiple switches, use the version that takes a String array, and place each individual item in a separate element. 
<br/> <br/>
If args is a String (not an array), then it can only be a single file or application with no parameters. It's not the same as executing that String using a shell. For instance, open("jikes -help") will not work properly.
<br/> <br/>
This function behaves differently on each platform. On Windows, the parameters are sent to the Windows shell via "cmd /c". On Mac OS X, the "open" command is used (type "man open" in Terminal.app for documentation). On Linux, it first tries gnome-open, then kde-open, but if neither are available, it sends the command to the shell without any alterations. In release 0125, this function was modified for Mac OS X and Linux support, and to better handle spaces in command names.
<br/> <br/>
For Java users, this is not quite the same as Runtime.exec(), because the launcher command is prepended. The method <b>exec(String[])</b> is a shortcut for Runtime.getRuntime.exec(String[]).
