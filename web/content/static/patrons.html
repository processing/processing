Processing has received key funding and support from a few of organizations and companies. This commitment has enabled a series of key improvements to the software. We hope to initiate more relationships in the future. </p>

<p>The Armstrong Institute for Interactive Media Studies at Miami University is funding The Oxford Project, a series of Processing development workshops during the 2008-2009 academic year. These four-day meetings in Oxford, Ohio have enabled the November 2008 launch of Processing 1.0 and are stimulating future development.</p>

<!-- Note: Add DMI at a later date. -->

<p>Oblong Industries funded Ben Fry to develop Processing during summer 2008. This funding provided the means to complete the 1.0 release in November 2008.</p>

<p>Ben Fry received a 2006 Media Arts Fellowship, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. This grant was the first time Ben was able to work on Processing as a funded project. This led to further developments of the OpenGL and PDF rendering engines, as well as significant enhancements to other libraries and their integration.</p>

<p>In summer 2003, The Interaction Design Institute Ivrea funded four individuals to work on Processing. This resulted in Dan Mosedale's preprocessor using Antlr, Sami Arola's contributions to the graphics engine and other contribution to the Processing Development Environment and 2D graphics engine. We are grateful to Gillian Crampton Smith for her encouragement.</p>

<p>We're extremely grateful to the first institutions who took a chance on our new software in 2001 and 2002: Musashino Art University (Tokyo), ENSCI Les Atelier (Paris), HyperWerk (Basel), Royal Conservatory (Hague). Many universities have integrated Processing into their curriculum and we're grateful to the pioneer faculty members and students at these institutions. They are too numerous to mention. The students and faculty in New York University's Interactive Telecommunication Program (ITP) deserve a special thank you for their early adoption and promotion.
