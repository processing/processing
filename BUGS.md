Very High - Dangerous!!! | PApplet allows *anything* to be run on the command line via PApplet.exec(String... args) method. At minimum it should be made private, but preferably removed altogether. Not going to post any code here, but it would be an easy matter to create a processing project that destroys a computer when it's run.
