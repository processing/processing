Integration with SketchPad.cc

s.cc being based on Etherpad has no API for calls from outside
at the moment. Content scraping is possible but probably not 
submitting stuff ..
Here's how to get latest of a sketch as plain text:
http://studio.sketchpad.cc/sp/pad/export/ro.9civzkE0CyCy6/latest?format=txt


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples.

Some of the standard examples should be included, but not library specific
ones. Currently there is no way to "just pick some" one has to include whole
branches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interface.

As the server keeps running until being explicitly stopped we might think 
about an animated icon. How does "Server running" look like?	

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Convenience.

A way to reopen the browser window, maybe even other browsers?
Find your own IP address so you can test the sketch from other clients 
on the network.
