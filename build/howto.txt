HOW TO BUILD PROCESSING ON YOUR FAVORITE PLATFORM


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//// Steps for First Time Setup 


1. INSTALL CYGWIN (windows users only). it's downloadable from 
   www.cygwin.com or specifically: www.cygwin.com/setup.exe
   linux users can hop ahead to step 2.

** of the packages, begin with the defaults, and add:

+ gcc-mingw - used to build processing.exe
  (this will also pull in gcc-core)

+ cvs - used for version control

+ perl - use this version, activestate or other distros have trouble
  
+ unzip, zip - for dealing with archives

+ included in the defaults, but make sure:
  coreutils (or textutils), gzip, tar

+ not required but useful: 
  openssh - command line ssh client
  nano - handy/simple text editor

** and be sure to leave the option selected for 'unix line endings' 

the cygwin installer is sometimes a little flakey, so it may take more 
than one try to get everything in there. in fact, it's often best to
run the installer once, and let it install all its defaults, then run 
it again, and select the items above. it's also useful to run the 
installer every few months to keep things fresh.


2. GRAB THE CODE FROM SOURCEFORGE

* this grabs the code as an anonymous user. if you have a sourceforge
  account, you should know how to grab the code as yourself.

# first do this
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/processing login
# just hit enter when it asks for a password

# then do this (may take a while)
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/processing co processing
# (maybe even a long while for you dialup and international folks)

# gonna do a few things in the p5 folder
cd processing

# a quick cleanup, removes empty (dead/old) folders
cvs update -P

# get back to the processing/ folder
cd ..


3. INSTALL QUICKTIME FOR JAVA (windows users only)

* you'll also need to install quicktime for java. grab a quicktime
  installer from: http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
  don't try to be sly & use the itunes installer. we all love itunes
  but it doesn't include quicktime for java by default. or if you were
  sly, you might need to read the point below about using the updater:

* if you already have quicktime installed, just make sure that
  quicktime for java has already been installed, use the quicktime
  updater (Program Files -> QuickTime -> QuickTime Updater) hit the
  'Details' button in the updater, and if it lists "Not installed" 
  for "QuickTime for Java", well, take care of that.


4. BUILD IT

# now to build for the first time:
cd /path/to/processing/build/windows

# or if you're on linux
cd /path/to/processing/build/linux

# for the followers of goatee man
cd /path/to/processing/build/macosx

# and then..
./make.sh

# if everything went well, you'll have no errors. (feel free to make
# suggestions for things to include here for common problems)

# then to run it
./run.sh

# each time you make a change, use make to build the thing 
# and run to get it up and running.

//// Updating to the Latest Version


5a. Each time you want to update to latest version from cvs:

cd /path/to/processing
cvs -z3 update
# -z3 means make it snappy (using compression)


5b. If new folders have been added, or you're gettin odd errors, use:

cd /path/to/processing
cvs -z3 update -d -P
# -d grabs new directories and -P cleans out old (empty) ones
# cvs is a little brain dead about this stuff

unfortunately there isn't a way to know (?) if new folders have
since been added. but if you're getting "class not found" errors
while building, then that's a good indicator that something is
missing from a subfolder.

If there have been significant changes, or you get weird build
errors, try deleting your 'work' folder. This will create a 
fresh build. This includes any changes to the reference, 
the examples, the libraries, jikes, or just about any time you
have to use -d -P with the update.
