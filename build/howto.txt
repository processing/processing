HOW TO BUILD PROCESSING


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


BUILDING THE WINDOWS VERSION


// Steps for First Time Setup 


1. INSTALL CYGWIN, downloadable from www.cygwin.com
or directly link to the installer: www.cygwin.com/setup.exe

** of the packages, begin with the defaults, and add:
cvs - used for version control
gzip - probably installed by default, just make sure
perl - use this version, activestate or other distros have trouble
tar, unzip, zip - for created archives
textutils - i think this is included in the defaults, but make sure

** these aren't required initially, but useful:
openssh (command line ssh client)
nano (handy/simple text editor) 

** and be sure to select the option for 'unix line endings'.

** other notes

the installer is sometimes a little flakey, so it may take more than
one try to get everything in there. you can also run the installer
again to add new applications, so you might try just installing the
base stuff, and then come back to install the other bits. 

it's also useful to run the installer (grab a new one from the site,
since it changes) every few months to keep things fresh.



2. GRAB THE CODE FROM SOURCEFORGE

* this grabs the code as an anonymous user. if you have a sourceforge
  account, you should know how to grab the code as yourself.

# first do this
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/processing login
# just hit enter when it asks for a password

# then do this (may take a while)
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/processing co processing
# (maybe even a long while for you dialup and international folks)

# gonna do a few things in the p5 folder
cd processing

# if you're not doing web development, you won't need those folders
rm -rf web web_gen

# this is actually done by the build script, but you may as well do it now
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/processing co bagel

# a quick cleanup, removes empty (dead/old) folders
cvs update -P

# get back to the processing/ folder
cd ..



3. INSTALL JIKES

* a copy of jikes, the ibm's free and speedy java compiler that we
  use, has been placed in build/windows/jikes.exe.gz

* NOTE! this version of jikes has been specially compiled under cygwin
  to use : as a path separator, so that all the build scripts work. so
  if you already have another version of jikes installed, this one is
  the one you want for building P5. 

* open up a cygwin shell, then go like dis:

cd /yourpath/to/processing/build/windows
# /yourpath/to is where you've placed the processing folder
# for instance, if it's in c:\processing, the line below would be 
# /cygdrive/c/processing/build/windows

# make a copy of jikes
cp jikes.exe.gz /usr/bin/

# unpack and install
cd /usr/bin
gzip -d jikes.exe.gz
chmod +x jikes.exe

# make sure it's now in the path
rehash

# and see if it works by typing:
jikes
# if it doesn't list the options, then something wasn't installed
# correctly. retrace your steps and see if you've done everything.
# or if i've made an error in the instructions, lemme know.

# back to home
cd /yourpath/to/processing



4. SET YOUR CLASSPATH (for bagel) 

* you need a few things in your classpath, they are:
  - the rt.jar from a java runtime (1.1 or 1.4) 
  - comm.jar, from javacomm. you can find a copy in 
    processing/build/windows/dist/lib/comm.jar
    if you don't already have it installed

* to add them to your CLASSPATH (win2k or xp), go to Control Panels -> 
  System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
  if CLASSPATH is already listed in one of the lefthand columns, 
  just make sure it includes those two things. if it doesn't, add
  them (with full paths to them), separated by semicolons.
  on win98 or winme (ack! don't use em!) you'll have to mess with
  autoexec.bat. but we strongly recommend not doing this on 98/ME.

* you'll also need to install quicktime for java, if you're building
  for windows or mac. grab a quicktime installer from: 
  http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/

* if you already have quicktime installed, just make sure that
  quicktime for java has already been installed, use the quicktime
  updater (Program Files -> QuickTime -> QuickTime Updater) hit the
  'Details' button in the updater, and if it lists "Not installed" 
  for "QuickTime for Java", well, take care of that.

* make sure that qtjava is in your classpath as well, done
  properly. arielm had problems with this, and adds:

  so i checked a bit and it seems that the quicktime 4 java
  installation (at least on windows xp) is broken, for the 2 following
  reasons:
  1) CLASSPATH is defined as a "System variable" 
     instead of a "User variable"
  2) the value of CLASSPATH is encosed into quotes (")

  after manually fixing these issues, things were fine. (either
  properly place quotes around a single version of CLASSPATH, or use a
  version that doesn't need to be quoted and has no spaces,
  i.e. replace 'Program Files' with the 8.3 dos version: 'PROGRA~1'
  (indeed, this awful nomenclature still works).


5. BUILD IT

* you'll need to close and re-open the cygwin window after setting
  your CLASSPATH.

# now to build for the first time:
cd /path/to/processing/build/windows
./make.sh

# if everything went well, you'll have no errors. 
# (need more doc here on common problems..)

# then to run it
./run.sh

# each time you make a change, use make to build the thing 
# and run to get it up and running. 



// Updating to the Latest Version

1. Each time you want to update to latest version from cvs:

cd /path/to/processing
cvs -z3 update
# -z3 means make it snappy (using compression)


2. Or if new folders have been added, use:

cd /path/to/processing
cvs -z3 update -d -P
# -d grabs new directories and -P cleans out old (empty) ones
# cvs is a little brain dead about this stuff

# if you've removed web/ and web_dev/, then do the update -d -P 
# from inside app/ and bagel/ (rather than from the just the 
# processing/ folder) otherwise -d will grab web and web_dev again

# unfortunately there isn't a way to know (?) if new folders have
# since been added. but if you're getting "class not found" errors
# while building, then that's a good indicator that something is
# missing from a subfolder.


//// MAC OS 9

this is actually built from inside osx, but then you reboot into os9
to move files around, remove and .DS_Store files that may have shown
up, and package the thing with stuffit. 

when first attempting to build, it's necessary to un-macbinarize the
Proce55ing application. (processing/build/macos9/dist/Proce55ing.bin)



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


HOW TO BUILD PROCESSING FOR THE MAC PLATFORM


// if you have any corrections/additions/suggestions:
// send email to tmohn@sbcglobal.net

//// MAC OS X/9

1. GRAB THE CODE FROM SOURCEFORGE

// this grabs the code as an anonymous user. if you have a sourceforge
// account, you should know how to grab the code as yourself.

// first do this

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/processing login

// just hit enter when it asks for a password
// then do this (may take a while)

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/processing co processing

// (maybe even a long while for you dialup and international folks)

// PERFORM MAINT ON FOLDERS FROM SOURCEFORGE
// gonna do a few things in the p5 folder

cd processing

// if you're not doing web development, you won't need those folders

rm -rf web web_gen

// this is actually done by the build script, but you may as well 
// do it now

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/processing co bagel

// a quick cleanup, removes empty (dead/old) folders

cvs update -P

// get back to the processing/ folder

cd ..


2. SET YOUR CLASSPATH (for bagel) 

// SETUP JAVA CLASSPATH.  You need to set an environment 
// variable for CLASSPATH.  This gets setup in your .tcshrc file for 
// your account.  Typically with a line like this:

setenv CLASSPATH /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/
Classes/classes.jar:/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/
Classes/ui.jar:/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home
/lib/ext/comm.jar

// Make sure you have comm.jar installed at the following location:

/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib/ext/comm.jar

// if it isn't there, you can get it from build/macosx.

// you'll also need to install quicktime for java.  grab a quicktime 
// installer from: http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/


3. BUILD IT

// first lets get bagel (the make.sh script does this as well if you're 
// feeling lazy).

cd [processing folder]

// grab off of sourceforge (should be logged in anon still)

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/processing co bagel

// now we need to unmacbinarize the proce55ing.bin file in the dist 
// folder.  we are currently using MacBinary II+ 1.0.2 (stuffit
// expander doesn't seem to work properly).  you can just install 
// the app under OS X and drag/drop-- but you need OS 9 installed
// on your box to do this (newer machines may not allow this now, 
// thanks to stevie's great ideas).  this should drop the Proce55ing 
// application unpacked into the dist folder.

// set permissions so you can execute the make.sh file.  not sure why 
// these permissions aren't set like the macosx build?

chmod +x make.sh

// now to build for the first time:

cd /path/to/processing/build/[mac os desc]

./make.sh

// any errors that might happen are obvious here.

// to create the distributable:

./dist.sh

// if everything went well, you'll have no errors.  this will
// drop a folder in your build directory named processing-0000-macosx/9

///// (need more doc here on common problems..)


4.  PACKAGE THINGS UP

//// MAC OS X

// make a copy of the new folder just built.  this folder lives here: 
// /build/processing-0000-macosx
// this copy is what you will use to clean things up and package.

// do some house cleaning!  poke through the structure making sure no 
// CVS folders are hanging around, etc.  command line works best 
// for this.

// to keep things simple and clean, create a folder called 
// processing-00##.  
// within this folder create two separate folders:  (drag the folder 
// above to Applications) and Processing 00##.  open the parent folder 
// and clean things up (ie lineup folders etc.).  now just drop the 
// parent folder into your disk utility app in os x (applications/
// utilities) to create the dmg that will be uploaded to the site.


//// MAC OS 9

// NOTE: make sure you setup stuffit to compress as .hqx files not 
// .sit.  also make sure that you zip up the folder under mac os 9 
// for max compatibility.

// make a copy of the new folder just built.  this folder lives here: 
// /build/processing-0000-macos9
// this copy is what you will use to clean things up and package.

// do some house cleaning!  poke through the structure making sure 
// no CVS folders are hanging around, etc.  pay close attention for 
// the .DS_Store files in any folders.  command line works best 
// for this.

// now just copy this clean folder to the folder that houses 
// your os 9.2 desktop.

// in order to finish packaging the os 9 build, you must reboot 
// into os 9.2.  once there we need to do some minor house cleaning 
// in this folder (ie make sure no .DS_Store files are hanging 
// around again, etc.)

// to keep things simple, just rename the folder to processing-00##.
// where ## is the revision number.  then zip it up with stuffit.


5. UPDATING TO THE LATEST VERSION

// Each time you want to update to latest version from cvs:

# -z3 means make it snappy (using compression)
cd /path/to/processing
cvs -z3 update

// Or if new folders have been added, use:

# -d grabs new directories and -P cleans out old (empty) ones
# cvs is a little brain dead about this stuff

cd /path/to/processing
cvs -z3 update -d -P

# if you've removed web/ and web_dev/, then do the update -d -P 
# from inside app/ and bagel/ (rather than from the just the 
# processing/ folder) otherwise -d will grab web and web_dev again

# unfortunately there isn't a way to know (?) if new folders have
# since been added. but if you're getting "class not found" errors
# while building, then that's a good indicator that something is
# missing from a subfolder.
