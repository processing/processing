in order to use the serial port under this "expert" version of
Proce55ing, you need to install the serial libraries yourself.

1. figure out where your java runtime is installed
   probably something like c:\Program Files\Java\jre-1.4.1_01

2. move the 'javax.comm.properties' file to the 'lib' folder 
   of the java installation

3. move the 'win32com.dll' file to the 'bin' folder of the
   java installation
