PROCESSING 1.1 (REV 0179) - 11 March 2010

This is the first general-purpose release since 1.0.9. The text below merges 
all of the changes from all the interim revisions, with the exception of the
changes for the upcoming Android tools, which are not enabled in this release.

Lots of bug fixes over 1.0.9, and several changes that improve how fonts are
handled. Because of the large number of changes (and that some functionality
actually changes, if that's actually a word), this is release 1.1 instead
of release 1.0.10. Which is nice, because release 1.0.10 sounds baffling.

[ font changes ]

+ It's no longer necessary to use textFont() before text() and other 
  text-handling functions. The default "SansSerif" font is used, which 
  varies by platform. 

+ Also in this release, the createFont() method will only load characters 
  as they are used, which should greatly improve the font situation on 
  non-Roman systems like Japanese. This will use far less memory, and should
  be all around much more efficient. Formerly, createFont() took several 
  seconds to run, depending on the speed of your system. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1111

+ Fixed a problem with the Create Font tool ignoring the 'smooth' setting
  on some systems.

+ Fixed a separate problem with the createFont() method also ignoring the
  'smooth' setting.

+ With the Create Font tool, you can also specify what Unicode character 
  blocks you'd like to use, making a much smaller font.

+ Fonts are no longer power of 2 by default. This should also make them more
  memory efficient. With future OpenGL updates, this will work even better.

[ other changes ] 

+ Lots of edits to the HTML that's used for exported applets. If JavaScript
  is enabled, Sun's new loading functions are used, which offer the best
  compatibility across browsers. If not, the old loading method is used.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1057

+ Changed the OpenGL HTML template to load differently, which should fix a
  NullPointerException in JOGLAppletLanucher with Java 6 Update 18 on Windows,
  and should also be more efficient altogether, because the JOGL libraries can 
  be downloaded just once from Sun, rather than for each sketch that uses them.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1452

+ Code from Takachin that handles full input method support in the editor for
  Japanese and other scripts that are more complicated than Roman text.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=854
  Thanks Takachin! 

+ Now using iText 2.1.7.

+ Changed how imports are handled in sketches. This may break some sketches
  that use java.xxx packages that aren't covered in the Processing reference.

+ With great help from Hansi, moved the build scripts over to Ant.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=151
  Also moved the special JRE for Linux and Windows out of SVN. It'll only be
  downloaded when 'ant dist' is run. 

+ Javadoc is slowly improving. More on that later.

+ Deprecated 'screen', and added screenWidth and screenHeight. Discussion here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1499

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Fix for filter(DILATE/ERODE) from Dave Bollinger
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1477

+ Added implementation for get/set methods inside PImage (w/o pixels[])

+ Updated JNA to version 3.2.4 to support Windows 7 64-bit
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1424
  Thanks to Maik for tracking down the problem and solution!

+ Fix from taifun_browser to handle texture memory leak with OpenGL and P3D.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1423

+ Hitting ESC inside Color Selector would quit Processing
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1006

+ To fix video, and some other libraries on Snow Leopard, exported applications
  are now explicitly set to run 32-bit on OS X.

+ Fix LITERAL_class so that blah.class syntax can be used in PDE code. 
  Found and fixed by Christian Thiemann. Thank you!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1466

+ Fix from Chris Lonnen to lock the minimum size for the main processing editor
  frame. (When too small, the console would disappear, etc.) Thanks Chris!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25

+ If you overwrite PApplet.main(), you're responsible for what happens.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1446

+ Re-enabled hack for temporary clipping. Clipping still needs to be
  implemented properly, however. Please help!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1393

+ SVG paths that use 'e' (exponent) not handled properly
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1408

+ Change build scripts to use UTF-8 for encoding with javac
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1394

+ Fix ant.jar/ant-launcher.jar error in the windows/linux build scripts
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1403

+ Fixed a problem where imports inside comments were being included.

[ keys ] 

+ Added ctrl-ins, shift-ins, shift-delete for cut/copy/paste on Windows and 
  Linux, but disabled by default on Mac OS X. You can change the setting by
  altering "editor.keys.alternative_cut_copy_paste" in preferences.txt.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=162

+ Added a preference to change shift-backspace to just mean backspace, 
  rather than delete. Set this entry in preferences.txt:
  editor.keys.shift_backspace_is_delete = true
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1463

+ Added an option for home and end keys traveling to the start/end of the 
  current line rather than the beginning/ending of a sketch. The latter is
  the HIG default for Mac OS X, but drives some people nuts. Change with:
  editor.keys.home_and_end_travel_far = false

PROCESSING REV 0178 - 4 March 2010

Tons of Android work in this release. A2D has been tested and runs correctly
for all of the examples in "Basics" and "Topics". A3D is not quite finished
yet, and the size() command is still causing crashes. 

This release also contains lots of work on Android Mode for the PDE, which
is being worked on by Jonathan Feinberg.

[ core ] 

+ Fix for filter(DILATE/ERODE) from Dave Bollinger
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1477

+ Deprecated 'screen', adding screenW and screenH. See discussion here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1499

+ Added implementation for get/set methods inside PImage (w/o pixels[])

[ fixes to android core ] 

+ Fix noLoop() and static-mode sketches.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1467

+ Fix the freakout that happens with onPause()

+ App not pausing or closing when switching to another activity
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1404

+ Bezier curves were broken in A2D (extra point is drawn connecting the 
  shape to the corner).

+ Fixed other minor bugs in shape drawing.

+ mask() now implemented in A2D

+ updatePixels() now work properly for A2D

+ set() should now be working

+ Using set() on an image that doesn't have a bitmap, or has pixels loaded.

+ requestImage() now working

+ Fix rotate() bug (was using degrees instead of radians)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1497

+ arc() now working properly

+ createGraphics() works, at least with A2D (or aliases P2D and JAVA2D)

+ Fixed "The application ... has stopped unexpectedly." when quitting slow app
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1485

+ test createFont()

+ createGraphics() broken
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1437

+ Remove legacy PGraphics3D class from processing.core.android
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1402

[ android mode ] 

+ Exception handling is much improved.

+ Get stdout and stderr from the emulator/device (println() now works).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1381

+ Removed the ANDROID_SDK env variable requirement.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1471
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1469


PROCESSING REV 0177 - 21 February 2010

Fix for the Android tools complaining "Open quote is expected for 
attribute "{1}" associated with an element type android:minSdkVersion."

Just posting a new revision because it's easier than writing instructions
for swapping the pde.jar file.


PROCESSING REV 0176 - 20 February 2010

Android changes are at the top, changes for the rest of Processing are listed
below that (a tipoff being that there's no PDF library on Android...)

[ android ]

+ Minimum platform support is changing to 2.0 instead of 1.6. That means 
  "Eclair" or later, and goodbye to my T-Mobile G1, undoubtedly the ugliest
  cell phone I have ever owned. Hello to Droid and Nexus One. 
  Performance is very poor on pre-2.0 devices anyway. 

+ Known issue: Sketches that use noLoop() are currently broken. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1467

+ Added support for libraries and the code folder.

+ Classes have moved to the processing.core package instead of 
  processing.android.core.

+ Slashes in the SDK path are now escaped properly on Windows.

+ Fix problems preventing Android Mode from running on Windows
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1432

+ The tint() method now works.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1435

+ loadFont() and text() now work properly. createFont() has not been tested.

[ changes ] 

+ Lots of edits to the HTML that's used for exported applets. If JavaScript
  is enabled, Sun's new loading functions are used, which offer the best
  compatibility across browsers. If not, the old loading method is used.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1057

+ Changed the OpenGL HTML template to load differently, which should fix a
  NullPointerException in JOGLAppletLanucher with Java 6 Update 18 on Windows,
  and should also be more efficient altogether, because the JOGL libraries can 
  be downloaded just once from Sun, rather than for each sketch that uses them.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1452

+ Code from Takachin that handles full input method support in the editor for
  Japanese and other scripts that are more complicated than Roman text.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=854
  Thanks Takachin! 

+ Downgraded the PDF library to use iText 1.5.4, because later versions seem
  to load slower, and don't seem to offer additional benefits. If the PDF 
  library gets worse, please post a bug and we'll go back to the 2.x release
  we were using, or upgrade to the more recent 5.x series.

+ Changed how imports are handled in sketches. This may break some sketches
  that use java.xxx packages that aren't covered in the Processing reference.

+ With great help from Hansi, moved the build scripts over to Ant.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=151
  Also moved the special JRE for Linux and Windows out of SVN. It'll only be
  downloaded when 'ant dist' is run. This makes the build and maintenance 
  more of a mess for me, but will save me from people whining about the 
  large files.

+ Javadoc is slowly improving. More on that later.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ Updated JNA to version 3.2.4 to support Windows 7 64-bit
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1424
  Thanks to Maik for tracking down the problem and solution!

+ Fix from taifun_browser to handle texture memory leak with OpenGL and P3D.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1423

+ Hitting ESC inside Color Selector would quit Processing
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1006

+ To fix video, and some other libraries on Snow Leopard, exported applications
  are now explicitly set to run 32-bit on OS X.

+ Fix LITERAL_class so that blah.class syntax can be used in PDE code. 
  Found and fixed by Christian Thiemann. Thank you!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1466

+ Fix from Chris Lonnen to lock the minimum size for the main processing editor
  frame. (When too small, the console would disappear, etc.) Thanks Chris!
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25

+ If you overwrite PApplet.main(), you're responsible for what happens.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1446

[ keys ] 

+ Added ctrl-ins, shift-ins, shift-delete for cut/copy/paste on Windows and 
  Linux, but disabled by default on Mac OS X. You can change the setting by
  altering "editor.keys.alternative_cut_copy_paste" in preferences.txt.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=162

+ Changed shift-backspace to just mean backspace, rather than delete. You
  can change back to the old behavior by setting this entry in preferences.txt:
  editor.keys.shift_backspace_is_delete = true
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1463

+ Added an option for home and end keys traveling to the start/end of the 
  current line rather than the beginning/ending of a sketch. The latter is
  the HIG default for Mac OS X, but drives some people nuts. Change with:
  editor.keys.home_and_end_travel_far = false

[ fonts ]

+ Starting in this release, the createFont() method will only load characters 
  as they are used, which should greatly improve the font situation on 
  non-Roman systems like Japanese. This will use far less memory, and should
  be all around much more efficient. Formerly, createFont() took several 
  seconds to run, depending on the speed of your system. 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1111

+ Fixed a problem with the Create Font tool ignoring the 'smooth' setting
  on some systems.

+ Fixed a separate problem with the createFont() method also ignoring the
  'smooth' setting.

  blocks you'd like to use, making a much smaller font.

  memory efficient. With future OpenGL updates, this will work even better.

  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1322
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1325

  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1337
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1344

+ Remove menu dimming code, in-frame menu bar, and warning message on OS X.
  A year later, Apple fixed the spinning wheel w/ the menu bar problem.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786

+ Fix "Unrecognized option: -d32" on OS X 10.4
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1324

+ Update the outdated "Get the latest Java Plug-in here" in exported applets.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1331

+ Use temporary files when saving files inside the PDE. Prevents problems
  when the save goes badly (e.g. disk is full).
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=967

+ Fix problem with "Save changes before closing?" was being ignored.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1193

+ Fix problems with adding/deleting tabs.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1332
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1092

+ Saving the project with the same name (but different case) 
  as an existing tab was deleting code on Windows and OS X.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1102

[ core ] 

+ filter(RGB) supposed to be filter(OPAQUE) 
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1346

+ Implement non-power-of-2 textures for OpenGL (on cards where available). 
  This is a partial fix for texture edge problems:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=602

+ Fix get() when used with save() in OpenGL mode

+ Immediately update projection with OpenGL. In the past, projection 
  updates required a new frame. This also prevents camera/project from 
  being reset when the drawing size is changed.

+ Removed an error that caused the cameraNear value to be set to -8. 
  This may cause other problems with drawing/clipping however.

+ Removed methods from PApplet that use doubles. These were only temporarily
  available in SVN, but that's that.

+ Use temporary file with saveStrings(File) and saveBytes(File).

[ updates ]

+ Updated to Minim 2.0.2. (Thanks Damien!)
  http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim

+ Updated Java on Linux and Windows to 6u16.

PROCESSING 1.0.7 (REV 0169) - 4 September 2009

Bug fixes and updates, also some tweaks for Mac OS X Snow Leopard. 

[ changes ] 

+ Tweaks for Mac OS X Snow Leopard, to force it to run in 32-bit mode.
  This should bring back the video library (if temporarily), and hopefully
  fix serial as well, though I didn't have a serial device handy to test. 

+ Fix problem where line highlighting was off in 'static' mode.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1263

+ Auto-format was killing Unicode characters (how did this last so long?)
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1312

+ PVector.angleDistance() returning NaN due to precision errors
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1316

+ Removed a major try/catch block from PApplet.main(), hopefully 
  this will allow some exception stuff to come through properly.

PROCESSING 1.0.4 (REV 0166) - 31 May 2009

Bug fix release. 

[ changes ] 

+ Changed the workaround for Apple's Java bug related to the menus in OS X.
  Rather than placing the menubar inside the sketch window, File > Sketchbook
  and File > Examples are simply dimmed out. Instead, use the Open button
  on the toolbar, which provides access to the same items. The preference
  to place the menu bar inside the window is still available, in case you 
  prefer the previous workaround.

+ Currently no 64-bit support for any platforms. On some platforms, you'll 
  simply need to replace the Java folder with the distribution with something
  more suitable for your operating system. 

+ Command line support is currently broken

PROCESSING 1.0.1 (REV 0163) - 29 November 2008

Processing 1.0 has arrived! You can read an overview of changes introduced
in the last few months here: http://processing.org/reference/changes.html

Also see the "known issues" section of the troubleshooting page:
http://processing.org/reference/troubleshooting/#known

This release (1.0.1) fixes a handful of issues that only showed up once we 
had more testing, particularly with the wider audience we've received in the
past week following the announcement.

[ bug fixes ] 

+ ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException with File > New
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1067

+ "CallStaticVoidMethod() threw an exception" on some Mac OS X machines
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1063
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1078

+ "editor.indent" preference setting does not work properly
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1073

+ Fixed some "An error occurred while starting the application" problems

+ Added a note about the Minim library to the changes page.

+ Disable parsing of regexps with the split() command

PROCESSING 1.0 (REV 0162) - 24 November 2008

Processing 1.0 has arrived! You can read an overview of changes introduced
in the last few months here: http://processing.org/reference/changes.html

[ known issues ] 

+ Sketches that size(w, h, OPENGL) and do not clear the background on each 
  frame can cause major flickering or problems when the screen clears anyway.
  There are several possible solutions:

  1. You may need to disable the default 2x smoothing by using
     hint(DISABLE_OPENGL_2X_SMOOTH).
  
  2. Update the drivers for your graphics card.

  3. Get a decent graphics card -- the OpenGL renderer is for advanced
     use, we don't support using it with cheaper built-in graphics hardware 
     like the Intel GMA 950. 

  4. If you're running Windows Vista, try disabling the Aero theme. 

  This flickering issue is being tracked here:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1056

+ "An error occurred while starting the application" when launching
  Processing.exe on Windows. This is a high priority however we cannot
  reproduce it on any of our test machines, which has delayed a fix.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=986

+ With P2D, P3D, and OPENGL, series of connected lines (such as the stroke 
  around a polygon, triangle, or ellipse) produce unattractive results when 
  strokeWeight is set.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=955

+ Unlike most applications, the menu bar is inside the editor window when
  Processing is used with Mac OS X 10.5. This is a workaround for an Apple 
  bug in Java 1.5 and 1.6 on Mac OS X 10.5 that causes the menu bar to be 
  so excessively slow that the application appears to have crashed.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786

  Please file a bug report with Apple at bugreporter.apple.com if you want
  this fixed. The problem has existed since the spring, and we first filed 
  a bug  with them in June, and we have received no indication that it when 
  it will be fixed, or if it will ever be fixed.

  Or if you want to take your chances with the slow menu bar, 
  you can change the default setting in the Preferences window.

+ Sketches that use the video library plus OpenGL have a problem on some
  OS X machines. The workaround is listed in Comment #16 of this bug:
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=882#c16

+ Command line support arrived in a recent release, but is not working yet.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1048

+ OpenGL rendering is more dim/darker in release 0149 and later.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=958
  Any help tracking this down would be most appreciated.

+ The first few frames of OpenGL sketches on Windows run slowly.
  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=874

+ When used with P3D, strokeWeight does not interpolate the Z-coordinates 
  of the lines, which means that when rotated, these flat lines may 
  disappear. (Since, uh, lines are, you know, flat.) The OPENGL renderer 
  setting does not share this problem because it always draws lines 
  perpendicular to the screen (which we hope to do in a future release).

in spite of their historical feel good campiness, i've removed the
notes from earlier releases because this file was getting out of hand.
