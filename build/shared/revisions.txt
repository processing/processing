this file is a list of changes between each release. this is not a
general reference of how to use processing, because the information
for older releases will be super crusty. caution: the beverage you're
about to enjoy is extremely hot.

ABOUT REV 0069 - 28 march 2004

this is yet another bug fix release, which repairs several things, 
mostly things that i've run into over the past few as i've been doing
a lot of coding with processing, and some things that were really
causing trouble for folks on the board. basically i was bummed out to
see bug reports on things that i had fixed, or could fix semi-easily.

i'm not releasing linux for this one for lack of time. it will also
not be listed (at least not initially) as the default download on the
page, since it hasn't been tested heavily: this release might not be
particularly stable, i threw it together because i've been working
with p5 a lot lately and had several fixes, but didn't have the time
to do the usual "vetting" process with the testers. if you have any
weird problems, just use 0068.

it's likely that a handful of the examples are also broken because of
the api changes.. my apologies.. 

there will likely be a couple more releases before the "big" 
release that i still need a better name for than "the big release".
suggestions are welcome.

- added an option to pde.properties so that users can set the amount
  of memory to for java mode applications. currently it's set to:
  run.external.memory=128
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1078699341;start=0

- wheel mouse should now be working when using java 1.4 on the mac.
  thanks to jonathan feinberg for the fix!

- lots of fixes to the font builder. remembers previous settings,
  doesn't die on small fonts

- added CFBundleIdentifier to mac version so that it's more osx savvy.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1078739015

- *temporarily* disabled "replace all" because it's doing more harm
  than good as of now. it will be back in the next release, i just
  didn't have time to repair it for this one, and since it's
  destructive, that's bad.

[ bug fixes ] 

- macosx was flickering several times on startup, no more. this was
  also the cause of some other threading weirdness across other
  platforms. this probably still needs a little work, but it's better.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1073111031

- some internal fixes to how camera modes worked.. screenX was
  slightly broken for some circumstances

- min() and max() with three variables were broken. no longer.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1076804172

- the constant for CONTROL wasn't set properly 
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1077058788

- fixed a bug when using non-ascii chars with fonts
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1077475307;start=0

- fixed a bug where split() would throw an Exception on an empty string
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1077664736

- fix bug where single pixel points were ignoring their alpha values


[ api changes & additions ] 

- loadStream() has become openStream(), for better consistency. 

- toInt(), toFloat(), to String() functions.. 
  ** the naming of these are subject to change..     **
  ** we haven't decided on a proper naming for them! **

- splitStrings() becomes just split().. splitInts() goes away. 
  splitInts becomes -> toInt(split(someString, ','));

- split() now handles multiple chars, i.e. 
  split(someString, ", ") will split on any number of comma or space
  chars in between (sort of a regexp but not really).
  to split on commas and any amount of whitespace between, use:
  split(someString, "," + WHITESPACE);

- WHITESPACE is a String constant that includes the normal whitespace
  chars (space, tab, linefeed, carriage return, etc) plus the unicode
  "non breaking space" char.

- chop() function that also handles the unicode non-breaking space
  character (found commonly on the mac)

- text(x, y, z) instead of just text(x, y)

- printMatrix() and printCamera() print the current (object space)
  transformation matrix and the camera (perspective) matrix. 

- nf() and nfs() now work on whole arrays of numbers

- nfp() is like nfs() but shows a plus sign instead of a space

- code from toxi to support .tga files in loadImage()
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1078459847;start=0

- bagel code is getting less 1.1 vs. 1.3 specific, thanks to additions
  from jonathan feinberg.

ABOUT REV 0068 - 2 february 2004

this is a bug fix release, not the planned version of 68 that supports 
multiple files and all sorts of amazing magic. it will be the last release 
for the next two months while ben finishes his dissertation. 


[ bug fixes ]

- concave/convex polygons are now handled properly. just don't make
  the last point of the polygon be the same as the first, otherwise
  you'll confuse the tesselator. however! there is a bug (that showed
  up during the release process.. ugh) that when smoothing is enabled,
  sometimes thin lines will be visible within a concave polygon. this
  will just have to be fixed in a future release. however, as long as 
  stroke() is enabled on the polygon, the lines should not be visible.

- fixed a bug that made the p5 environment freeze when an applet crashed

- fixed problem with the environment locking up when the console got
  too full. the console now has a maximum number of lines, set to 500 
  by default. the console is also cleared on each run, so that doesn't 
  cause trouble anymore. you can change both settings in pde.properties.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1075759355

- fixed a find/replace bug that made the thing lock up when changing
  case on a search. oops.
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1075416670
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1075416741

- fix to the noise() function by toxi (thanks toxi!)

- fix to the sphere() function by toxi (yay toxi!)

- font builder should update when the size for the font is changed
  (so long as the size itself is valid)

- font builder bug, was cutting off parts of letters

- better loadStream support when bagel is used by itself


[ features ] 

- added support for non-ascii characters in the font builder
  http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1067596427

- added an option to disable smoothing on font creator

- better support for international characters inside the development
  environment. 

- toxi added sphereDetail(), to set the level of accuracy on spheres

ABOUT REV 0067 - 28 october 2003

another bug fix release. high importance for people using 'java' 
mode, or external libraries (like amit's jsyn stuff), or of medium
importance for everyone else.


[ bug fixes ]

- set the correct version number for the about dialog. also added code
  to prevent the wrong release number from being used on a release.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067135202;start=0

- fixed IllegalArgumentException when using run.bat or run-expert.bat
  martin gomez was kind enough to track down the cause of this bug.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067132725
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067132753
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067135344;start=0

- updated to a new version of jikes, the compiler that's used behind
  the scenes. fixes a couple issues where code wouldn't compile.

- save/saveFrame was super-slow, especially on macosx, where times for
  a 640x480 image could easily approach a full minute. things have
  been sped up way more better. 
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067135103;start=0

- size not properly detected during export when "size()" was the first
  thing in a program. now fixed.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067217366;start=0


[ bug fixes for java mode ]

- native libraries (.dll, .jnilib, or .so files) can be dropped
  into the 'code' folder of your sketch. this didn't work in the past,
  but is now much simpler. 

- println() wasn't working properly from java mode classes, and
  sometimes caused applications to die. no more.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067218548;start=0

- you no longer need to have java installed (i.e. the expert version)
  to use java mode. so the following entry has been removed from
  bugs.txt: "java mode in rev 63 and higher only works if you have
  java available in your path--meaning that you've installed it
  yourself under windows or linux, or this will always be the case 
  for macosx."

- fixed a problem with multiple jar files
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067359364;start=0


[ changes ]

- apple has updated quicktime for java on the mac for 6.4
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1067135162;start=0

- on compiler errors, instead of the message saying "send to
  bugs@proce55ing.net" instead it asks to use the discourse section of
  the site, and automatically opens that page in a web browser.

- netscape.javascript is now included in the lib/ folder. seems that
  not all jvm distributions include it, so just easier to include our
  own copy.

ABOUT REV 0066 - 19 october 2003

several important bug fixes in this release, strongly recommended. 
lots of things have been repaired, though this release hasn't been
heavily tested, which might necessitate a 67 sometime later this week.


[ bug fixes ]

- smooth() no longer smooshes the last line of objects.

- stroke on smoothed polygons was drawing at 8x. no more.

- runtime exceptions no longer lock up the environment. also fixed
  situation that was making the play button stick.

- files from the 'code' folder are now packaged with applets on export.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1066586882;start=0

- re-capitalizing the name of a file on macosx or windows would

  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1066501376;start=0

- fixed bug with "open sketch folder" on macosx

- fixed bug with help->reference and "find in reference" on macosx

- dimmed 'replace' button after 'find' to disallow double-replacing. 

- added notes about quicktime 6.4 problems on the mac to bugs.txt

- modification to ignore dotfiles on export, i.e. so that .DS_Store
  files aren't included in your .jar with an exported applet.


[ changes ]

ABOUT REV 0065 - 30 september 2003

one major bug fix that repairs nastiness in drawing text that showed
up starting with rev 60. and some other tiny tidbits.


[ bug fixes ] 

- fonts have been return to their previous state, fixing some real
  ugliness that appeared starting with release 60.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064722202

- beautify does a better job of retaining the caret position, rather
  than jumping back to the beginning of your code. it's not perfect
  yet, but perfection will happen post-beta.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064220242;start=0


[ additions ] 

- hint(DISABLE_TEXT_SMOOTH) has been added at arielm's request. the
  previous hint SMOOTH_IMAGES is now always enabled for text, 

- the about box now includes the current release number
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064220242


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


ABOUT REV 0064 - 29 september 2003

this release fixes three bugs, any of which might be major for you, or
in total may seem like nothing at all. they're all specific fixes for
people that piped up about something 

this is another mini-release like 61, 62, and 63. it's a suggested
download, but not as huge as revision 60. 


[ bug fixes ]

- thick lines, which disappeared in rev 60, have returned triumphant
  due to a nudge from ed.

- fixed a bug on macosx, especially with safari, that caused the
  environment to complain about an "unexpected char" when pasting code
  copied from a safari web page. (reported by flight404 many moons
  ago, but was causing me trouble today so i fixed it.. ah selfishness)
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1055381110;start=0

- removed the 'cancel' option from "save changes before quitting?" on
  windows, since it seems to not always work, causing destruction of
  code and sadness. specifically, it ate bijeoma's code:
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1064865914;start=0


[ additions ]

- the font builder now sets a default filename when selecting a font,
  since axel was annoyed that it didn't have a default.


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


ABOUT REV 0063 - 27 september 2003

revision 63 includes some major new features and semi-major bug fixes,
however it has not been tested very thoroughly. 

like 61 and 62, this is a suggested download (for people who have at
least revision 60). if you're running a version older than 60, then
this version is strongly recommended.

if you used a version of processing older than 60, and have not yet
tried revision 60 or later, then you should read the section of
revisions.txt that talks about all of the many changes that happened
in revision 60.


[ additions ]

- this release is the first to add the ability to load external .class
  and .jar files to your projects. it is also the first revision to
  support the full 'java' mode as described in the documentation. in
  order to use this mode, you'll need to have java somewhere in your
  path. this will change in future releases.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1050571290
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1055355089

- when using 'add files' and selecting a .class, .jar, or shared
  library file, the files will be copied to the 'code' folder for
  inclusion in your sketch, instead of the 'data' folder.


[ bug fixes ] 

- on windows 2000, some applets were running very very slowly half 
  the time. arielm spent hours tracking down the problem caused by a
  single one line change, so win2k users (and i) have him to thank.

- fixed problem where the serial port menu on windows was always
  dimmed, unless processing was started using the .bat files. so
  serial port should work again.

- beautify menu was broken (it did nothing) and has been repaired.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


ABOUT REV 0062 - 24 september 2003

this release primarily introduces new features. it is the third
release in three days, as i'm pushing to get features out and
available rather than getting held up in a long release like some of
the others have been. this pace of releases will not continue, and is
only happening while i have time to work on the environment.

releases 61 and 62 are suggested downloads, since they fix minor bugs
or add features, as opposed to a more strongly recommended update like
revision 60.

people who haven't used 60 yet should refer to its release notes for
changes that you'll need to make to your programs in order to work in
releases 60 and later.


[ changes & additions ] 

- "add files" menu command as a simpler way to add files to your
  sketch folder than navigating through the explorer.

- a built-in font creator has been added, available from the sketch
  menu. this tool will allow you to create your own fonts, and add
  them directly to your sketch. you can also use 'add files' to add
  fonts from the 'fonts' folder. however, the fonts folder will be
  removed in a future release. 

- no more digging for sketches.. "show sketch folder" opens up the
  folder of the current sketch using the finder on the mac or the
  windows explorer on windows. 

- after exporting a sketch, automatically open the applet folder that
  was just created.

- some modification to the menu layouts, i.e. "clear history" is now
  part of the history menu itself.

- switched back to a more red color for errors in the console. 
  the yellow was an accident. but again, it's editable in 'lib' ->
  pde.properties if you liked the yellow or want something else.


[ bug fixes ] 

- finally found the problem with showing reference on macosx and fixed
  it. this had eluded me for a while since it was working ok on my own
  machine, but thanks to timothy mohn for harrassing me into fixing it.


[ known problems ]

- have been moved to the 'bugs.txt' file. check there for the status
  of your favorite bug/feature.


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


ABOUT REV 0061 - 23 september 2003

this is a brief addendum release to revision 60, that fixes a few
small things. if you've downloaded 60, this isn't necessarily a
"must-have", but it fixes a few quirks that showed up in the final
stages of rev 60.

if you used a previous version of processing, and haven't yet tried
60, then please read its release notes, as many things have changed.


[ bug fixes ]

- fixed a handful of examples that were broken in rev 60.

- modifications to the sound code that prevented it from running with
  the microsoft java 1.1 vm.

- removed "width 200 high 200" message that showed up during export.

- fixed IllegalAccessError that showed up in applets that had inner
  classes, when run inside the ancient microsoft java vm. 

- brightened the red color used for error messages in the console,
  since some found it hard to read. also note that you can always set
  this color yourself by editing the pde.properties file that is found
  inside the 'lib' folder.

- fixed saveFrame() to allow for just "blah.tif", as was stated in
  this document for rev 60.

- removing .DS_Store files from the windows release


[ additions ] 

- if no reference is found for "found in reference", p5 provides a
  message rather than doing nothing.


[ known problems ]

- a complete list of known problems can be found in the revisions.txt
  entry for release 60.

- a lot of println() commands will make the environment really slow or
  even lock up completely. it's because the console can't keep
  up. we're working on a fix.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064182823



[ common problems, not actually bugs ]

- names of sketches cannot start with a number, or have spaces
  inside. this is mostly because of a restriction on the naming of
  java classes. i suppose if lots of people find this upsetting, we
  could add some extra code to unhinge the resulting class name from
  the sketch name, but it adds complexity, and complexity == bugs. :)


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


ABOUT REV 0060 - 22 september 2003

IMPORTANT NOTE! ACHTUNG!
YOUR OLD CODE WILL PROBABLY BE BROKEN WITH THIS RELEASE.

read the section on api changes very carefully, because a few
functions have been renamed, and the behavior of background() has
changed completely. almost all programs will have to be updated.

but the happy part is that there are many many new features, and this
change to the behavior of background() means lots of positive things.

we decided to make as many of these naming changes as possible all at
once, so that you only have to really mess with your code a single
time. as casey put it, it's better to remove the band-aid quickly.

if you're confused, all the examples have been updated for this
release to use the new function names and background methods. a quick
glance through them should help clear things up.


[ api changes -- read carefully, avoid headaches ]

- noBackground() no longer exists, so remove it from your code.

- background() actually clears the screen immediately, rather than
  simply setting a color. this means that you should use background()
  a the beginning of loop(), if you want your applications to behave
  similar to the way they used to.

- hint(SMOOTH_IMAGES) no longer exists, and is simply the default.
  just remove it from your code. if you get an error saying:
  "No field named "SMOOTH_IMAGES" was found in type "Temporary_NNNN_NNNN".
  you should remove the line "hint(SMOOTH_IMAGES);" from your program.
  SMOOTH_IMAGES is no longer needed and has been removed.

- fill() no longer colors images. if you want to color images, use
  tint(), which is just like its cousins fill and stroke. like its
  cousins, there's also noTint(), his (her?) contrarian twin.

- getPixel() -> get() and setPixel() -> set()

- get() and set() work directly on BImage objects.

- get(int x, int y, int width, int height) copies a section of pixels
  and puts them in a BImage. (based on code from toxi)

- screenGrab() -> saveFrame()
  saveFrame() will save a sequence of numbered tiff images
  saveFrame("blah.tif") will save the current frame as blah.tif
  saveFrame("blah-####.tif") will save a sequence of images
    as blah-0000.tif, blah-0001.tif, etc.
  saveFrame("blah.tga") will save the current frame as targa.
  saveFrame("blah-####.tga") is up to you to figure out.

- strokeWidth() -> strokeWeight()

- bezier(a, b, c, d, t) -> bezierPoint(a, b, c, d, t);
  curve(a, b, c, d, t) -> curvePoint(a, b, c, d, t);

- vertexTexture(u, v) has been rolled into vertex(), so:
  vertex(x, y); vertexTexture(u, v); -> vertex(x, y, u, v);
  vertex(x, y, z); vertexTexture(u, v); -> vertex(x, y, z, u, v);

- vertexNormal() -> normal()

- font.stringWidth(String s) -> font.width(String s)
  font.charWidth(char c) -> font.width(char c)

- removed control key 'F' for 'reference', gave it to 'find'. 
  also set cmd-shift-f as 'find in reference'.


[ additions ] 

- good god, an implementation of find & replace, which means we've
  caught up to 1984.

- BImage.save(String filename) has been implemented. the filename
  should be something and a .tif or .tga at the end to determine how
  the file should be saved.

- background(BImage image); has been implemented, so your background
  can automatically be replaced with an image. note that the image
  must be the same size as your drawing area.

- BImage.copy() returns a copy of an image. better yet, 
  BImage.copy(int width, int height) returns a copy of an image, but
  resized to that specific size. (code contributed by toxi)

- online() returns a true or false for whether an applet is online or
  not. (or really, whether it's running in a proper applet viewer)

- status(String text) shows a string in a browser's status bar, or
  sends it to the console in an application. (this replaces
  Applet.showStatus if you're familiar with that)

- bezierTangent() now implemented, but curveTangent() is unfinished.

- param(String p) reads params from your html code for your applet.

- text(float something, float x, float y) and 
  text(int something, float x, float y) have been implemented.
  just because their syntax is otherwise cumbersome.

- textMode(ALIGN_LEFT), textMode(ALIGN_CENTER), textMode(ALIGN_RIGHT)
  are implemented, and do what you might expect them to.

- clean and pretty two dimensional circles and ellipses have been
  implemented. this will speed and beautify your 2D elliptical needs.

- added several error messages to provide more useful feedback about
  misuse of font api functions or common problems.

- added an error message (instead of failing silently) for when
  noCursor() is attempted in an exported applet.

- BImage.blendMode() has been added, thanks to toxi. details and
  examples are forthcoming. 

- it is now possible to draw inside of setup(). 

- you are no longer restricted to using numbers (rather than
  variables) for size() and background().

- BGraphics now subclasses BImage. if you don't know what that means,
  don't worry about it. just trust me.

- single pixel lines finally have alpha and z values. thick lines are
  coming soon. (code from ivrea-funded carlos)

- color() with alpha now works properly

- repaired the function formerly known as screenGrab() so that it is
  far less likely to run out of memory the way it did before. in
  general, if you can get the thing on screen, you should be able to
  save it to disk with the new implementation.

- fixed bug where bezier curves weren't quite straight because of an
  internal rounding error. also fixed another related bug.

  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1044438078;start=0

- fixed bug where the 'open' button would get stuck if no sketch was
  selected for opening.

- fixed a bug where the caret would show up even though processing
  processing's window was not active.

- removed ugly white borders around gui elements that show up on
  macosx (workaround for a bug in apple's java 1.3 implementation).

- removed an extra push() and pop() in the text(), which may speed
  things up a bit.

- we've silenced the "couldn't delete..." messages


[ known problems, pardon our dust ]

- macosx doesn't provide an option to 'cancel' when it so politely asks
  if you want to "save changes before quitting?". this is because of
  weirdness in apple's java that we're trying to straighten out.

- lines with stroke weights that aren't 1 are probably broken.

- single pixel lines still have some problems with drawing over things.

- the size of exported applets has jumped in this release. this will
  get smaller again in a future release. we're in the middle of
  transitioning between two different sets of rendering/graphics code.

- clipping planes are not yet implemented. meaning that objects may
  sometimes fly into the camera and turn upside down or do other tricks.

  polygons won't draw properly.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1062469819;start=0

- jikes is ~9 megabytes in size, which is a bit obnoxious. it doesn't
  hurt anything but we plan to put it on a diet for a future release.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1062581723

- curveTangent() is not yet implemented. contributions welcome.

- strokeMiter() and strokeJoin() exist but are not implemented.

- textures warp in strange ways due to perspective problems.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1050650262

- smooth() is not completely implemented. there will be quirks in how
  it draws (like a weird flat line at the end of a shape, or areas
  that are less than smooth).

- on windows, processing can't be run from a folder that has non-ascii
  characters in its name. 
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1062794781

- video examples sometimes crash the whole environment on windows

- net needs work, it's currently sending unicode, instead of ascii or
  UTF-8, data. this can cause problems with other programs.

ABOUT REV 0059 - 31 august 2003

this is mostly a bug fix release. expect multiple releases in the next
few days as we head towards beta.


[ bug fixes ]

- no more "Class not found" errors when trying to use an exported
  applet. fixed a supernasty bug that made applets incompatible with
  older versions of java, like the one that everyone uses with
  internet explorer (microsoft's java vm). 
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1062376081
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1062376340

- this rev does a better job of finding quicktime for java than the
  last release. quicktime for java search path is not as fragile as it
  was, instead is uses the environment variable QTJAVA, which is set 
  by the quicktime for java installer, should point to a valid
  QTJava.zip. if not, you'll get an error message asking you to
  install/reinstall quicktime.

  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1062376240

- fonts no longer get goofy if imageMode() has been used
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=BugFixes;action=display;num=1062376464


[ additions ] 

- beginSerial(String port) and beginSerial(String port, int rate)
  since these are used far more commonly than setting the parity and
  stop bits. from the suggetsions board:
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1061595591


[ known issues / bugs / if only i had time... ] 

- "find in reference" and the reference menu items don't seem to be
  working on some machines. if we can figure out why it works on some
  machines and not on others, we'd like to repair this before beta.

- quicktime for java is still required on windows. it's required on
  macosx too, but it's installed there by default. the requirement
  will be removed in a later release for people who don't want to use
  video, but the fix is more difficult than anticipated, so it will
  probably happen after the initial beta release.

- run.bat hasn't been given love for a while and may not work. at the
  very least, you'll need to modify it to find your copy of quicktime
  for java. 

- expect lots of 'cannot delete somefilename...' messages in red that
  appear when you hit play or stop. these are mostly cosmetic, and
  will be cleaned up in a future release.

- 'export to application' remains unimplemented, though it's closer,
  and should be ready before beta.

- sound doesn't always stop when the 'stop' button is hit (i.e. the
  mixer example seems broken). for now, you have to first quit
  processing to stop it. 

- 'preferences' will get better in a future release

- the noise() functions were added, but don't yet work, they'll be
  fixed soon.

- presentation mode is flickery and unusable, this will be fixed soon.

- the horizontal scroller for the text area has some weirdness, this
  may not be fixed until after beta, depending on how bad it is.

- using screenGrab() or saveBytes() or some of those things will cause
  trouble inside applets. we'll try to do better error trapping soon
  so that your applet doesn't crash when this happens.

ABOUT REV 0058 - *also* 5 august 2003

a handful of fixes because of late-breaking problems with 57. argh!

see the revision 57 release notes for the more useful stuff that's
changed, since it was released the same day.


[ windows ] 

- check to see if quicktime for java is installed, if it isn't, then
  warn the user that it needs to happen.

- moved back to java 1.4.1 so that sound and video work better.


[ macosx ]

- replaced jikes with a version that doesn't require 'fink' to be
  installed.

- use java 1.3.1 as the default, instead of java 1.4. seems that 1.4
  is just not ready for prime time.


[ linux ]

- brought linux java vm up to 1.4.2

- checks to see if jikes is in the PATH, warns if not. this is
  temporary, since jikes isn't properly found.

- testing and notes for new rxtx serial support


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


ABOUT REV 0057 - 5 august 2003


[ additions ]

- an all-new compiler (jikes) has been wired in by dan mosedale. this
  is super exciting, because of all the compiler trouble we've had in
  the past. thanks to ivrea for providing funding for dan.

- a scrolling, selectable console has been implemented by dan
  haskovec, another of our ivrea-funded hackers.

- context menu cut/copy/paste (right-click in the text area) also
  implemented by dan h.

- saveBytes and saveStrings now implemented (and documented in the
  reference)

- curveMode(int segments) and bezierMode(int segments) now
  implemented. these control the number of line segments used to draw
  a curve. the default has always been 20, but you now have the option
  to set it higher or lower. 

- there's also curveMode(int segments, float squishy) determines the
  squishiness when drawing catmull-rom curves. normally this is set to
  zero, but setting different values will produce more bubbley curves
  that don't necessarily connect all the points. 

- a new function has been added to calculate points along a bezier
  curve, rather than just drawing it. so for the old function:
  bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4); 
  if you wanted to draw 10 segments along it:

  beginShape(LINE_STRIP);
  for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    float t = i / 10.0;  // t should go from 0..1 along the curve
    float x = bezier(x1, x2, x3, x4, t);  // get the x coordinate
    float y = bezier(y1, y2, y3, y4, t);  // get the y coordinate
    vertex(x, y);
  }
  endShape();

  this was also asked for/inquired about in the following bboard posts:
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1053449577
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1057393989

  the same syntax also works for curve() in addition to bezier().  

- functions have been added to set the cursor, based on code
  contributed by amit pitaru (thanks amit!) usage is in the reference.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1059485109


[ updates ] 

- 'export' now exports and links the .pde file instead of the .java
  file, and links that from the web page that is produced
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1046250912

- sound actually stops when the 'stop' button is hit.

- video, net, and sound all work more than once, no longer requiring
  you to quit processing to run a video/net/sound example again.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1055044714

- syntax and examples for video have been sorted out.

- modified millis() to always return useful values
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1058465635

- last-used serial port is saved when quitting the environment

- changed more things from "Proce55ing" to "Processing", since the
  other naming was confusing lots of people. let us know if there are
  parts we've missed.


[ bug fixes ]

- long bezier curves are finally fixed

- got rid of a semi-frequent ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when
  smooth() was enabled and images were involved


[ known issues / bugs ] 

- 'export to application' remains unimplemented, though it's closer,
  and should be ready in 58 or 59.

- 'preferences' will get better in a future release

- the noise() functions were added, but don't yet work, they'll be
  fixed for 58.

- macosx hangs randomly, though not consistently enough to figure out
  what's going on.

- on some machines, presentation mode seems to have become unusable,
  this will be fixed in 58.

- the horizontal scroller for the text area has some weirdness, this
  may not be fixed until after beta, depending on how bad it is.

- using screenGrab() or saveBytes() or some of those things will cause
  trouble inside applets. in 58, we'll try to do better error trapping
  so that your applet doesn't crash when this happens. 
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1059928189;start=0


[ windows ] 

- windows uses java 1.4.2. in general, this is better, except for 
  problems with generating some kinds of audio. if you're having audio
  trouble, then install java 1.4.1, and remove the 'java' folder from
  the processing distribution to use it.

- differences between the 'expert' and normal releases for windows
  have been minimized significantly. as long as you have a jvm
  installed (1.4 strongly preferred), you may as well use the expert
  version. 

- serial port has been improved, and requires no additional
  installation steps, even for the 'exper't release.

- slightly better processing.exe for windows

- background of menus is no longer white, apparently it was a jvm
  problem, and it's fixed in 1.4.2.
  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1051303115


[ mac os x ]

- macosx updated to use java 1.4. similar to the pc, this is better
  but not always. if you're having trouble, check the instructions in
  readme.txt to see switch it back to 1.3 (which was the default for
  the previous release)

- reference loading and opening the p5 site finally works

- fixed the menus to make them more mac-like. added help menu, removed
  the extra 'quit' menu from 'file', etc. 

- the serial port has been ironed out, and requires no longer requires
  additional installation, although you do need to double-click the
  serial_setup.command script to set up some permissions (unless
  you've installed rxtx 2.1_6 already.. if you don't know what that
  means, run the script). more information in readme.txt. thanks to
  tom igoe for input and heckling to get this to work.


[ mac os 9 ]

- macos9 support is in the freezer until after beta. we still want to
  support macos9, but it was taking too much of our time as we're on a
  strict september deadline for the beta release.


[ phew ]

- that's a lotta stuff


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


ABOUT REV 0056 - 3 july 2003

[ shouting outwards ]

this isn't everybody, but thanks much to the folks who helped on the
*software* side of this release:

hernando and casey have completed an additional 15 examples covering
topics of video, network, and tangible.  

this is the first release with pre-testers (benelek and mkoser)
checking things out before we accidentally push out a bad
release. also timothy mohn handling the macos9 and macosx packaging
process.

arielm, the bagel papa poule, has been catalogging the graphics engine
bugs and creating tests for each of them. this has helped get more bug
fixes into the graphics engine, more quickly.

toxi has done several fixes and tweaks to the graphics engine, details
listed below.


[ new features (new bugs) ]

- added more words to the syntax coloring

- added a constructor for BImage that takes a java.awt.Image

- added FileInputStream version of loadStream for locally running code

- added screenGrab(String filename). this grabs an uncompressed tiff
  image of the current screen, just like screenGrab(). if ".tif" isn't
  in the filename, it will be added.

- loadStream/loadBytes work with InputStreams and URLs

- get current stroke/fill/background color with:
  color f = fill();
  color s = stroke();
  color b = background();

- handling of up/down/left/right and control/shift/alt keys, e.g.

  void keyPressed()  
  { 
    if (key == UP) { 
      println("up"); 
 
    } else if (key == DOWN) { 
      println("down") { 
 
    } else { 
      println("around"); 
    } 
  } 

- link(String urlname) now implemented as a simpler way to get to URLs


[ bug fixes ]

most of these were reported by folks on the bboard. thank you all!
the people who notified us of the bug are in [brackets] though we may
have missed a few.. some of these are reported multiple times..

- transparent gif images now draw properly.. no more workarounds!
  [reported by several people]

- reference now properly unpacks, rather than sitting in the folder
  like a dumb zip file. oops. [mkoser, benelek]

- imageMode issues have been ironed out

- added print(char c) and println(char c) so that they don't just 
  print numbers to the console [benelek]

- fonts were taking up more memory than necessary [arielm]

- added ceil/floor to syntax coloring

- added net stuff to syntax coloring

- fix for points that were drawing invisible (extrusion example was
  broken) [benelek]

- fixed nagging ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException on images [benelek]


[ performance ]

- fast 'flat' image drawing has been enabled again and debugged

- fast image drawing then rewritten and debugged again (by toxi)

- last line highlights properly on error (fix by danm)

- code for much faster lines and points (by toxi)

- adaptive circle segment sizing (by toxi)


[ still broken ]

- video and net stuff is still having trouble. this had been priority
  for this release, but has been taking longer than hoped, and we had
  so many fixes that we wanted to push the current rev out.


ABOUT REV 0055 - 27 may 2003

WARNING! THIS RELEASE IS LESS TESTED THAN SOME OTHERS, AND INCLUDES
LOTS OF NEW CODE, SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THINGS COULD BE VERY BROKEN. 
if you run into trouble, as with any release, just let us know about
the bug on the bboard, and use the previous one that worked for you
(i.e. go back to 54) it's all about 'alpha'.


[ big changes ]

perhaps very exciting, this is the first release to include explicit
support for audio, video, and network. perhaps more exciting is that
this code was developed by developers other than me. 

net and video code was contributed by hernando barragan of ivrea
http://people.interaction-ivrea.it/h.barragan
everyone say "thanks hernando!"

the audio code is by carlos rocha, a hired gun whose 
employment was made possible by the generous support of ivrea. 
yay carlos! yay ivrea!

more about these guys can be seen at: http://proce55ing.net/info.html


[ status of audio, video, net ]

- audio should be java 1.1 compliant, meaning that it works inside
  applets and on each of the platforms. audio should be working
  reasonably well, and has been tested by carlos a good bit.

- similarly, the net code should be just ducky.

- video input and reading movie files is done through quicktime for
  java, which means that you have to 1) be using windows or macos, and
  2) have the durn thing installed. video is a little bumpy (you may
  find it broken or unusable), which we're ironing out. but the
  problems have been showing up inconsistently, so we preferred to get
  the release out so that y'all can start playing with the other new
  features.


[ new features! new bugs! ]

- sort functions for arrays of ints, floats, doubles or Strings

// here's how it works for floats:
float a[] = { 3.4, 3.6, 2, 0, 7.1 };
sort(a);
for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
  println(a[i]);
}

- added wheel mouse support for osx, when running java 1.4. 
  NOTE! we don't actually recommend using java 1.4 under macosx, as it
  seems to be much less stable than 1.3, and appears to introduce some
  weird inconsistencies when running p5. (this also fixes a bug where
  using a 1.3 vm with the windows expert version would fukker the
  environment).


ABOUT REV 0054 - 11 april 2003

[ ok, so 53 was a bit of a dog ]

- fixed problem with web colors being broken

- turned off error message spew


ABOUT REV 0053 - 4 april 2003

[ major bug fixes ]

- finally found and fixed the 'disappearing caret' bug that some
  people were having on windows. text editor is much more usable.

- fixes to non-smoothed images, no longer makes a weird line in the
  center of some images, or leaves out a line of pixels at the end.

- lots of fixes to anti-aliasing, though it's still not anywhere near
  perfect. still suffers most of the problems mentioned below.


[ small tweaks ]

- color(r, g, b, a) now works, also color c = #RRGGBBAA (like web
  colors, but with alpha at the end)


[ known bugs ]

- alpha is a little weird (mostly doesn't work) on lines. it won't
  work on single pixel lines unless smooth() is turned on. 

- smooth() is still imperfect. you may find some jagged edges. text
  marches in a funny way (i.e. typography04). shapes don't always
  properly overlap (i.e. you can see triangles on spheres)

- images with smooth() enabled are coming out a little garbled

- concave polygons don't draw properly

- lots of other exciting things just waiting to be found out!


ABOUT REV 0052 - 5 march 2003

[ feature additions ] 

- alpha/transparency is partially working.. there are still problems
  (see 'known bugs' section below) but it's in there.

- smooth() and noSmooth() are partially implemented. they've got
  several bugs that we know about but might be fun to play with. we
  know of most of the bugs so we hope to get to them soon.

- fill color can be set for images. IMPORTANT: to get just the image,
  be sure to set the fill to white.

- images no longer cache by default IMPORTANT: if you *want* images to
  cache, you should use loadImage("filename.jpg", false). the second
  parameter is whether or not images should be 'forced' to load fresh.

- get the on-screen locations of an xyz point using:
  float sx = screenX(x, y, z); 
  float sy = screenY(x, y, z); 
  float sz = screenZ(x, y, z);

- get the object-space coordinates (how the object is affected by
  translate and rotate etc) using:
  float ox = objectX(x, y, z); 
  float oy = objectY(x, y, z); 
  float oz = objectZ(x, y, z);

- constrain() is now part of the api

- format numbers with nf().. syntax: nf(int num, int digits)
  to make '27' into '0027' -> String formatted = nf(27, 4);

- also for numbers with decimals.. nf(float num, int left, int right)
  to make 27.3 into '027.3000' -> String formatted = nf(27.3, 3, 4);
  or use zero if you don't care the number of digits:
  i.e. make 27.3 into "27.3000" -> String fmt = nf(27.3, 0, 4);

- camera functions now work. the following is the code for the
  perspective camera (sorry no more docs, you can check opengl
  references for more info until we get caught up)
  beginCamera();
  cameraMode(CUSTOM);
  perspective(fov, aspect, nearDist, farDist);
  lookat(eyeX, eyeY, eyeDist, eyeX, eyeY, 0, 0, 1, 0);
  endCamera();
  there's also ortho(left, right, bottom, top, near, far) to give you
  an orthographic projection.. frustum() is another useful function in
  this class. these work like their opengl equivalents, but without
  docs are for advanced users only.

- more matrix math.. applyMatrix() takes 16 floats which get
  multiplied by the current transformation matrix. resetMatrix()
  resets the transformation matrix to identity. 

- switched to jre 1.4.1_02 from 1.4.1_01


[ bug fixes ]

- some programs that used 'color' didn't work, now they do.

- fixed other broken examples.

- missing images should no longer lock up the environment. on windows,
  they used to throw an exception and lock everything up.

- color for 'use external editor' works with new scheme.

- numberFormat() had a bug where commas would show up. oops.


[ known bugs ]

- still can't figure out the 'caret disappearing' bug.

- alpha is a little weird (doesn't always work) on lines. it won't
  work on single pixel lines unless smooth() is turned on. 

- smooth() is still imperfect. you may find some jagged edges. text
  marches in a funny way (i.e. typography04). shapes don't always
  properly overlap.

- random freezes under windows, after running a few time. every 20th
  or every 100th time the app just freaks out. use ctrl-alt-del to
  kill the java runtime and restart your app. this will slowly be
  ironed out. 


ABOUT REV 0051 - 31 january 2003

enables key presses in the editor when 'alt' or 'option' is pressed. 
there was a problem with the mac german keyboards, and probably
others, where folks couldn't type { and } (alt-8 and alt-9) and were
instead doing lots of copying and pasting. released because this was a
major bug for some, and it needed to happen before a workshop.


ABOUT REV 0050 - 27 january 2003

released a little sooner than hoped, to fix a single showstopper bug
first discovered by josh nimoy. two sets of quotes were left out of
the export-to-web code, which web pages that didn't work.


ABOUT REV 0049 - 26 january 2003

a release of p5 to honor the national tv advertising holiday
known as the super bowl in the united states.


[ feature additions ] 

- lots of new examples (some may have issues, see 'known bugs' below)

- code with beauty and grace: new coloring for syntax and the editor,
  fancied up to work more like the p5 site itself. 

- loadImage and loadStream now support http:// URLs (thanks to glen
  for pointing out the omission

- framerate() is a function that always returns the current frame rate
  as a float. 

- framrate(float num) sets the framerate to a specific number. it can
  be used inside setup() or even inside loop(). framerate(0) ressets
  back to the maximum possible framerate.

- new math functions: ceil, floor, and round all work on floats.


[ bug fixes ] 

- attempt has been made to fix the disappearing caret bug. i haven't
  been able to reproduce this on my win2k machine, so i don't know if
  it's fixed.. you'll have to let me know.

- pmouseX and pmouseY are now colored like their siblings mouseX and
  mouseY (thanks benelek)

- pmouseX and pmouseY now get set the very first time mouseX and
  mouseY are set, which might help remove some "if (firstTime)" code
  in a couple of projects.

- fixing the print() weirdness uncovered a bug with long lines in the
  console. 


[ between bug and feature ] 

- nicer looking default html for exporting. that old stuff was
  embarrassing. we had hoped it would be too embarrassing for anyone
  to use, but we were wrong. so we've improved the default.

- print() now shows things on the console, even without a println().
  thanks to mike davis and others for pointing this out.

- delay() should no longer slurp up cpu time and make your machine
  flip out. also, it doesn't run on the first time through loop(),
  making things a little smoother. (thanks to glen murphy for the
  report)


[ known bugs ]

- some examples seem to be broken, this will be ironed out for 0050

- a couple tweaks with the syntax of 'color' statements are needed,
  this is related to the above


ABOUT REV 0048 - 7 january 2003

[ mac os ]

- this release includes a bit of tweaking to the fonts that are used by
  default so that they look nicer on the mac. also, anti-aliasing is
  turned *off* by default (thanks to franklin_mint for the tip), which 
  is a little more appropriate for coding. if you want to re-enable it, 
  check out pde.properties inside 'lib'.

- tried java 1.4 dp8 but it *does not work*, at least not very well,
  with processing. assertion failures or outright crashes. blech. 
  hopefully apple will get this cleaned up and finished soon, because
  it's already running fine under 1.4 on windows.

[ windows ] 

- the release is now split in two, using 'standard' and 'advanced'
  versions. the standard release includes a working java vm, and is
  all set up and ready to go. the advanced version is for people who
  already have java installed (and don't want to deal with the 20MB
  download), and know what they're doing enough that they can also
  install the serial port code by hand. instructions on installing the
  serial code are in the 'serial' folder inside the advanced release.

- wheel mouse works again

- increased the default memory allocation to 64 MB. 


ABOUT REV 0047 - 5 january 2003

[ happy new year ]

- hopefully january 2003 will be a good month for p5, as i have
  a short bit of time to work on it and there was a beautiful little
  ibook under the p5 xmas tree to help me with the mac releases. 
  i hope to get a few revisions out this month so i can get back 
  my 'real' work.

[ features ] 

- the text editor has once again been replaced. the new one is fancier
  and less buggy. most obvious thing to note is text coloring. 
  the editor is based on the jedit 'syntax' package. jedit is an
  amazing and feature heavy java-based text editor with an online
  community the size of an organized religion as compared to our
  little p5 cult. see http://www.jedit.org for worship times.

- sketchbook can now be more recursive (folders within folders) than
  it used to be. for those inclined to playing with fire (you're using
  alpha software, so this must be you) you can set the root of your
  sketchbook directory to something besides "sketchbook" inside the
  Proce55ing folder. details in the 'readme' doc.

[ bug fixes ]

- a strange crashing after a few weeks of use on the macosx has been
  fixed. it got upset as soon as a .DS_Store file made its way into
  the sketchbook directory. i'd get upset too since those little
  buggers get pooped all over the place as soon as a mac connects to
  anything, but instead some code was written to ignore them. i'm
  trying to learn to ignore them myself. thanks to fdb, brendanberg,
  jes and perhaps others who notified of this one. 

- the undo forever problem has (hopefully) been squashed. in 0046,
  one could undo until the text area went empty, or the previous
  project loaded. if one were to hit undo quickly enough, they might
  have noticed the clock on their wall moving backwards.


ABOUT REV 0046 - 20 november 2002

[ major release, new features ]

- now uses a fancy, swing-based text area. things should behave 
  much better for most platforms, particularly on the mac. 

- undo/redo, cut/copy/paste/select all are all supported.

- added 'rename' function, because 'save as' leaves behind
  too many boogers sometimes. this is now the default when clicking
  on the sketch title, instead of 'save as'.

- better error messages for serial port--actul notification if
  the port is unavailable or not properly installed.

- javax.sound is imported by default, so when running inside the
  editor, it's possible to use these classes to play audio files 
  and control midi devices. doesn't work for exporting to applet.

- on windows, sun's xml classes are included as part of the imports,
  so at least from inside the editor, it's possible to use the built
  in xml support from jdk 1.4.

- support for 3D curves in the graphics api. this means new versions
  of curve(), bezier(), curveVertex() and bezierVertex().

- sketch tweaks: naming for sketches is no longer random, but uses the
  date. also, during a run, the window is now named after the current
  sketch.


[ bug fixes ]

- mouse: pmouseX and pmouseY behave more like people expect 
  (they're set at the end of loop() instead of whenever there is 
  new mouse movement)

- macosx: the status bar now resizes with the rest of the 
  window.. this was a workaround for some apple java weirdness.

- fixed more of the issues that cause the random freezes when
  hitting play

- textarea shouldn't spew so many exceptions anymore

- rectangles were drawn one pixel too large


[ a few of the known issues ]

- this release is not available for mac os 9. there were problems
  just before release, and there was no point in holding up the 
  more important platforms for another week.

- download size for windows is getting enormous. in the future will
  switch to having people download and install java 1.4 separately.

- mouse wheel only works on windows, because jdk 1.4 
  is required for mouse wheel, and osx is behind the times.

- it's possible to undo past where it's truly possible, so if you
  undo too many times, your program might disappear. just redo. 


ABOUT REV 0045 - 20 october 2002

[ internal release only ]

- major tweak to fix some of the random freezing and crashing that
  occurred when hitting the 'run' button.

- changes to sketch menu: no more CVS and .cvsignore entries and
  sketches are only added if they have the correct structure

- shape mode TWO_CORNERS is now called CORNERS


ABOUT REV 0044 - 2 september 2002

[ features ] 

- can now use an external program to edit, such as bbedit on the pc or
  emacs on unix. select 'use exteral editor' and the textarea will
  become un-editable. you can then edit with your favorite text
  editor, and the code will be updated in the window each time you hit
  the 'run' button.

- added ability to set foreground and background colors of the
  editor. editor.program.fgcolor and editor.program.bgcolor can be set
  to your favorite color in pde.properties. also the the background
  color indicating 'external editor' is in use can be set via
  editor.program.bgcolor.external.

- more file i/o and data processing capabilities, see changes under
  api additions

- 'beautify' is now enabled, though it may eat all your code in the
  process. if it does, just go back to the previous version by using
  the history menu, and get to the proce55ing website and let us know
  the change of events.

[ api additions ]

- String[] loadStrings(String filename) 
  returns the lines of a file as entries in an array of strings

- byte[] loadBytes(String filename) 
  retrieves a file's contents and places them into a byte array for
  easy processing

- String[] splitStrings(String what) 
  String[] splitStrings(String what, char splitChar) 
  splits a String into several smaller strings wherever there's a
  space. ie. splitStrings("quick brown fox") becomes an array with
  elements "quick", "brown" and "fox". the 'splitChar' is optional,
  you can have the line broken up by tabs (if you use '\t') or any
  other character.

- int[] splitInts(String what)
  int[] splitInts(String what, char splitChar)
  same as above, but parses the line as integers

- float[] splitFloats(String what)
  float[] splitFloats(String what, char splitChar)
  you can imagine what this one does

[ api changes ]

- getStream is now loadStream

[ bug fixes ]

- arrow keys now work in a hokey way under macosx. this is better than
  not working at all, but still not great. it's also not really my bug
  fix, but a workaround for apple's bug.

- editor window can now be resized to one's content under osx

- sketch windows won't pop up offscreen anymore.. and if a sketch
  window is too large, it will simply center on-screen.

- names with underscores and other illegal characters weren't being
  restrained. this allowed / and : to be used when renaming/saving
  sketches, which caused the app to blow up.

- console window doesn't die as it approaches 1000 lines of text

- default font size for the editor under macosx is smaller


ABOUT REV 0043 - "ALPHA" - 2 august 2002

- this is the official "alpha" release. released for all platforms
  with a completed readme.txt


ABOUT REV 0042 - 2 august 2002

[ finishing up ]

- fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in texture use

- added icon to replace the coffee cup

- 'run' button now stays highlighted properly


ABOUT REV 0041 - 1 august 2002

[ big things ]

- handling of mouse/key events smoothed out and much improved

- added a (wimpy) scrollbar for the console

- fixed problems with #ffcc00 colors

- export was failing with no 'data' dir

- background() now works for applets in draw() mode

- fixed imageMode() with 2d images

- cursor no longer hides in the editor window (hacked around this sun
  java vm bug)

- linux and windows now have their own stdout.txt and stderr.txt
  like the mac, so that stuff is echoed out for easier cut/paste


ABOUT REV 0040 - 1 august 2002

[ oops ]

- fixed a bug that prevented 39 from running at all. argh.


ABOUT REV 0039 - 31 july 2002

[ you feel yourself getting very sleepy ]

- repaired run/present modes.. now much smoother. use ESC to quit out
  of present mode (or stop & close window when in regular mode).

- fixed links to reference and web site from file menu. works on the
  mac now, and maybe even linux.

- build 'release' version of Proce55ing.exe that doesn't scare casey
  and need MFC42.DLL

- tested serial for windows, macos, macosx.. serial working really
  well for windows

- removed 'edit' menu because it's worthless

- fixed run.bat for windows

- many tidbits of testing on multiple platforms


ABOUT REV 0038 - 30 july 2002

[ the excitement doesn't stop ]

- fancy new packaging for all platforms... all four platforms now have
  double-clickable applications, with icons and everything. macos9
  even has a splash screen. linux doesn't have an icon because icons
  only slow unix people down. would like to have splash screen on
  other platforms but probably no time to implement before alpha.

- lots of work in getting macosx and macos9 versions cleaner, stabler,
  and prettier. os9 is still super slow (at least on my poopy
  powerbook) but it runs. 

- serial port code now working (well) under windows

- examples are now included in the sketchbook


ABOUT REV 0037 - 27 july 2002

[ a few great things ] 

- 'history' now implemented, jump back to old versions of your app

- now saves applet window position between runs

- no exception when size() not called!

[ that go great together ]

- slightly different technique for substituting f's 

- comment mangler codec no long mangling so badly

- console converts tabs in stdout/stderr to spaces for indent

- line numbers for errors now slightly more correct

- linefeed weirdness in code base

- the data dir can now have subfolders

- more new make.sh/dist.sh goodness

- wrote to everyone who had signed up for the alpha

- still receiving bounced mail


ABOUT REV 0036 - 27 july 2002

significant hacking coming into deadline for alpha release

[ features and additions ]

- first rev off the press with the more semi-automated build
  system. should be much easier to build all four platforms
  more-or-less simultaneously.

- folded serial into BApplet, though it's not fixed

- built macos9 version

[ bug fixes and tweaks ]

- fixed exception when quitting on linux and mac

- fixed height and background of buttons in the status area (macosx)

- introduced os-specific properties files

- fixed setPixel(i, j, #99cc00)

- mouse no longer being funny when outside a 100x100 box in 
  120x120 window


ABOUT REV 0035 - 23 july 2002

- duplicate/rename replaced with save as

- curves were broken (didn't draw anything)
  now they're not (they draw things)

- curve() now makes more sense and fits all four points provided

- using translate() no longer makes lines turn black. ahem.

- fixed status message color

- added newline before program code when exporting .java files

- removed NullPointerException on startup


ABOUT REV 0034 - 22 july 2002

- fixed the problems with launching applets, implemented frame
  around the applet being run, also implemented presentation mode

- with any luck this one should be a little more stable than some
  of these other ones in the 30s series that i keep releasing without
  any sensible amount of quality control.


ABOUT REV 0033 - 8 july 2002

- duplicate and rename now implemented, more (should be all) of 
  the menus are actually functional. some are hacks (item to
  launch proce55ing.net and the reference) but things should be
  generally more consistent.


ABOUT REV 0032 - 7 july 2002

- another major release that irons out issues of export and 
  the toolbar. a button for a new project is included, and 
  the toolbar items properly open/load/save entries to/from
  the sketchbook. export should be working, as should external 
  files accessed via getImage/getStream/etc. 


ABOUT REV 0031 - 5 july 2002

- this is a major release, representing several victories. 
  most important: sketchbook is finally in there. every piece 
  of work is a 'sketch', a very lightweight project setup. 

- export has not been tested and has a good bit of new code
  so that may be problematic.

- menubar with all available options--note that these relate to
  sketchbook, and that the toolbar buttons may not work as well.
  use menus/key commands where possible(!)

- generally more application-like with prompts for the user
  for saving changes when closing a sketch or quitting.
  editor now keeps track of changes made. window positions and
  the last sketch opened are saved.

- concept of a user name associated with the app, right now
  just set to 'default' but in beta will be able to change
  the name for workshops and general use. 

- current items in sketchbook (serial/dbn) aren't in correct format,
  and won't work if you switch to them


ABOUT REV 0030 - 2 july 2002

- fix bug where comments were being removed from exported files

- new 'color' datatype, the following are now valid:
  color c = color(23, 45, 99);
  color c = #ff00cc;


ABOUT REV 0029 - 1 july 2002

- actually updated pde.jar, export, pde.properties, BApplet.java 
  in sketchbook, removed extra dbn.pde from lib (it's in sketchbk)

- new api: triangle, quad (put rect back too)

- keyPressed() and mousePressed() events

- new functions: degrees(), radians() 

- new color tidbits (though color still ints) final solution
  for get/set pixel debate


ABOUT REV 0028 - 1 july 2002

- serial port should work again (win32comm was missing)

- modified pde.properties slightly for console and header

- added output console the main interface

- old-style c++ int(), float(), char(), byte() all work 
  for casting of datatypes, instead of confusing c syntax

- size now works in draw() mode

- fixed annoying findSelection bug spew on startup

- 0.4f now works, formerly wasn't allowed

- lots of preprocessor tweaking for exceptional cases

- jre now in its own subdirectory, separate from 'lib'


ABOUT REV 0027 - 7 june 2002

- released on the floor of dis2002. welcome to london.

- editor.buttons.bgcolor was having issues

- plane is now quad, PLANE is now QUAD

_ latest iteration of colors and buttons


ABOUT REV 0026 - 7 june 2002

- fixed the situation where i'm a dork and forgot to 
  actually update the pde.jar file, which had rendered the 
  changes in rev 0025 irrelevant


ABOUT REV 0025 - 6 june 2002

- 'rect' is now 'plane'

- QUADS are now PLANES, QUAD_STRIP is PLANE_STRIP

- curve() and bezier() now behave the same way

- made all ui colors/fonts accessible from pde.properties

- fixed long font names for the mac release


ABOUT REV 0024 - 22 april 2002 afternoon

- lighting was broken, but no longer

- turned lights off by default


ABOUT REV 0023 - 22 april 2002 3am

- versions 21 through 23 dealt with getting the beast to work smoothly
  for the numer workshop


ABOUT REV 0020

major release, significant, code-destroying changes

- largeish handful of api changes (see docs for update)

- naming of api for BagelImage and others changed to BImage

- ProcessingApplet is now BApplet

- doesn't work on the mac due to update problem

- new user interface (not all features work yet)

- no longer need to use 'f' with floats
  in fact, don't ever use f with floats b/c you'll get an error


ABOUT REV 0019 - 25 february 2002

noticeable changes:

- many changes to names of functions in api

- default background color is gray, size is 100x100

internal changes:

- single color function, colors properly clamped, MemoryImageSource
  moved into ProcessingApplet

- rect() now affected by transforms more properly

- long list of other tidbits in cvs


ABOUT REV 0018 - 11 february 2002

bug fix:

- i broke fonts in the last release. now they work again. my own fault
  for trying to improve things.

feature: 

- projectSize(x, y, z, width, height, depth) is like projectPoint()
  but allows you to transform an object shape to screen space and puts
  the size into g.projX, g.projY, g.projZ


ABOUT REV 0017 - 23 january 2002

features and tweaks:

- setFont() now takes a font size

- exporting to applets is slightly less buggy

- hopefully lines are only a single pixel thick when they should be,
  in slightly more cases

- added a 'hint' for smoothing of images and fonts. put
  hint(SMOOTH_IMAGES) in your code to enable smoother text and images,
  but at the risk of things running more slowly. use
  unhint(SMOOTH_IMAGES) to disable.

- millis is a variable that always contains the number of milliseconds
  since your applet started as an int. before it was always zero. use
  it wisely.

- loadImage, loadFont, and getStream are behaving better

- no longer the random exception in graphics that would cause your
  programs to hang due to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. haven't
  fixed the bug, but it's at least being caught and worked around.

known issues:

- if you're using 'extends ProcessingApplet' in your code, you'll have
  to use that class name for anything that you export. otherwise incur
  the wrath of a bunch of spew at the dos prompt.

- consistently thin lines are still erratic and not under control

- the line highlighted for any particular error is often a joke

- lots of other things, too numerous to list that make me wonder if
  this will ever be ready to go


ABOUT REV 0016 - 20 january 2002

- disabled (by default) the sketchiness from the previous version. so
  the commportinuse trouble is back, unless you re-enable the hack
  in the pde.properties file and set 'play.external' to true

- no actual code changes in this version, but just upped the rev
  number to avoid confusion


ABOUT REV 0015 - 11 december 2001

known issues:

- this version of processing is even more sketchy than many other
  ones. but maybe it fix two huge issues, so i'm releasing it
  anyways with this caveat. just go back to 14 or another one if this
  gives you too much trouble.


features and tweaks:

- includes a strange hack that fixes the CommPortInUseException that
  had been so annoying, forcing you to restart processing to run your
  apps. the downside is that the fix means that if there's an error in
  your app, you have to check the console (the msdos prompt) for the
  error line, because it won't get highlighted automatically

- switch to the IBM's java virtual machine. it seems stabler than the
  sun one, and sun's stinks because of that nasty screen flickering
  bonanza that starts after you've been running processing for a bit.


ABOUT REV 0014 - 10 december 2001

features and tweaks:

- completely flat, unresized images are now significantly faster. this
  affects any time that you use image(img, x, y) and you haven't yet
  used translate/rotate/scale/etc. 

- thin, one pixel lines are much much faster, provided you aren't
  scaling them larger, by say scale(10) or something like that.

- new version of java compiler (kjc) that hopefully sucks less.

- bezierCurve() and catmullRomCurve() have reappeared


bugs fixed:

- way too many OutOfMemoryErrors and maybe that nasty flickery/jumpy
  thing.

- 3D calls to vertex() weren't making things 3D unless a translate or
  a rotate was used


known issues:

- flickery/jumpy thing after the applet runs for a little while. this
  is a bug in sun's java virtual machine (i can't actually program the
  pyrotechnics you're seeing on your screen) but may have resurfaced
  due to low memory conditions because run.bat was screwed up. so the
  problem may be fixed. hopefully. maybe. hmm. 

- i've tweaked a bunch of stuff in this release but haven't had a lot
  of time to test. things look like they're doing much better. but as
  is the case with any release, you can always go back to a previous
  version if the new one gives you too much trouble.


ABOUT REV 0013

features and tweaks:

- you can set the background color to be used when your applet is
  in full screen mode. in lib/pde.properties change the line
  fullscreen.bgcolor=#0080ff
  to include whatever color you want. the syntax is the same as web
  pages, although you aren't limited to the web palette.

- screenGrab() functionality! get happy.
  add screenGrab() at the end of your loop() function to produce
  a series of numbered tiff-format images that can be imported 
  into a video editing app. or call screenGrab() when the mouse is
  pressed to take quick snapshots. 

- colorcube applet is updated to the current release.
  it is also now included in the sketchbook/examples directory.

- for the technically inclined or curious, the source code for
  ProcessingApplet is included in the sketchbook/standard directory.
  it's not particularly pretty, since it's continually changing, but
  can be useful if you're wondering about how things work.


bugs fixed:

- the fix for rev 12 wasn't actually included in rev 12. grr.
  this implies 1) i'm an idiot, and 2) rev 11 and 12 are the same.

- ellipse was drawing opposite the direction of the origin.

- default program now actually works--replaced colorScale()

- editor was selecting the wrong line for errors. 


ABOUT REV 0012 - 29 november 2001

this was a simple fix for a big problem... programs that included
'extends ProcessingApplet' didn't work and gave a cryptic error
message. other than that, no new features.


ABOUT REV 0011 - 28 november 2001

i've changed (broken) enough things in this new release that i'm
writing down a list of changes. your programs may run a little funny
in rev 11, but it's all for the better in the long run. let me know if
you have trouble getting things to work. and of course, keep a copy of
rev 9 around in case things go wrong.

that said, rev 11 should be a much happier place to work. due to the
harrassment of your classmates, i've completed (simple) font support,
among other things.

[for those who missed rev 10, it only existed for 15 minutes, because a
bug was found as i was preparing to send it out.]



FONTS are working. a simple example:

void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
  setFont(loadFont("fonts/Univers76.vlw.gz"));
  fill(200, 200, 00);
  background(10, 70, 200);
}

void loop() {
  rect(10, 10, 100, 100);
  translate(mouseX, mouseY);
  scale(20, 20);
  text("I'm a little typeface short and stout", 0, 0);
}

the 0, 0 part at the end of 'text' is the x, y location to put it. 
the scale(20, 20) means 20 point font (fonts are 1 pixel high). 
(note that with the scale() in there, the x, y coords for text() will
also be multiplied by 20x.)

bunch of cheezy fonts are included in a 'fonts' directory. not
sure if i'll include these in the future, but at least it's a start.



IMAGES are working. a simple example:

BagelImage b;

void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
  fill(100);
  b = loadImage("max_van_kleek.gif");
}

void loop() {
  image(b, mouseX, mouseY);
}

this drags poor max around the screen with the mouse position. the
image should be in the same directory as run.bat. jpeg images can be
used too.



RANDOM() functions, more random than ever

// get a float between 0 and 40, or [0..40) for math weenies
float a = random(40);

// get a float between -1 and 1
float b = random(-1, 1);

// get an int between 0 and 9
int c = (int) random(10);



PIXELS... you want them

pixels[] is an int array that contains all of the image data from the
screen, in ARGB format (packed into ints). play away.

if you don't know what that means and would like to use the pixel
array directly, let me know.



FIXED WIDTH FONTS

make-your-own-fixed-width-fonts-in-photoshop are supported.
but i'm not gonna bother documenting them unless someone asks.



ALTERCATIONS

+ rect(x, y, width, height) instead of rect(x1, y1, x2, y2)

+ ellipse(x, y, width, height) instead of oval

+ box(size) instead of cube()

+ box(width, height, depth) instead of box(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)

+ sphere(size) stays the same

+ image() instead of imageRect()

+ translate(x, y) in addition to translate(x, y, z)

+ scale(size) and scale(x, y) in addition to scale(x, y, z)

+ rotate(angle) rotates by angle in 2D

+ rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ (angle) each rotate by angle 
  around their respective axes

+ transform( .. 16 floats here .. ) if you think you're matrix math
  genius and wanna play with your own transformations



LESS ANNOYANCE

+ no longer write software backwards! new shapes being drawn actually
replace older shapes, even when using flat, 2D surfaces. 

+ no need to use 'extends KjcProcessingApplet' anymore, just use
'extends ProcessingApplet', and processing will figure out whether
the 'Kjc' part is relevant or not.



PROBABLY NEVER NOTICED

+ colorScale() no longer exists. use colorMode(RGB, ...)
  instead, where ... is whatever you would've put inside colorScale()

+ included run95.bat for people who are using 95/98/ME. you can use
  this .bat if run.bat opens a dos window and closes it quickly
  without starting processing. just put processing at the base of your
  c: drive in a folder called 'processing'.
