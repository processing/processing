# DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THIS FILE!!! 

# These are the default preferences. If you want to modify 
# them directly, use the per-user local version of the file:

# Documents and Settings -> [username] -> Application Data -> 
#    Processing -> preferences.txt (on Windows XP)

# Users -> [username] -> AppData -> Roaming -> 
#    Processing -> preferences.txt (on Windows Vista and 7)

# ~/Library -> Processing -> preferences.txt (on Mac OS X)

# ~/.processing -> preferences.txt (on Linux)

# The exact location of your preferences file can be found at
# the bottom of the Preferences window inside Processing.

# Because AppData and Application Data may be considered 
# hidden or system folders on Windows, you'll have to ensure
# that they're visible in order to get at preferences.txt

# You'll have problems running Processing if you incorrectly 
# modify lines in this file. It will probably not start at all.

# AGAIN, DO NOT ALTER THIS FILE! I'M ONLY YELLING BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!

# instead of \ on windows or : on macos or whatever else

# If you don't want users to have their sketchbook default to 
# "My Documents/Processing" on Windows and "Documents/Processing" on OS X, 
# set this to another path that will be used by default. 
# Note that this path must exist already otherwise it won't see
