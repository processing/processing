KNOWN BUGS FOR THE MOST RECENT RELEASE

this was moved out of the release notes since it's getting too long,
and since only a handful of things change between releases


..................................................................


COMMON PROBLEMS (NOT BUGS)
things that are often perceived as bugs, which means maybe they'll be
changed in the future, but for now, they're not actually 'broken'.


- names of sketches cannot start with a number, or have spaces
  inside. this is mostly because of a restriction on the naming of
  java classes. i suppose if lots of people find this upsetting, we
  could add some extra code to unhinge the resulting class name from
  the sketch name, but it adds complexity, and complexity == bugs. :)

- 'export to application' remains unimplemented, though it's closer,
  and should be ready before beta.

- 'preferences' will get better in a future release

- quicktime for java is still required on windows. it's required on
  macosx too, but it's installed there by default. the requirement
  will be removed in a later release for people who don't want to use
  video, but the fix is more difficult than anticipated, so it will
  probably happen after the initial beta release.

KNOWN BUGS
the real deal, keeping us awake at night


- clipping planes are not yet implemented. meaning that objects may
  sometimes fly into the camera and turn upside down or do other tricks.

- concave polygons still don't work, meaning that lots of irregular
  polygons won't draw properly.

- a lot of println() commands will make the environment really slow or
  even lock up completely. it's because the console can't keep
  up. we're working on a fix.

- macosx doesn't provide an option to 'cancel' when it so politely asks
  if you want to "save changes before quitting?". this is because of
  weirdness in apple's java that we're trying to straighten out.

- lines with stroke weights that aren't 1 are probably broken.

- single pixel lines still have some problems with drawing over things.

- the size of exported applets has jumped in this release. this will
  get smaller again in a future release. we're in the middle of
  transitioning between two different sets of rendering/graphics code.

- curveTangent() is not yet implemented. contributions welcome.

- strokeMiter() and strokeJoin() exist but are not implemented.

- textures warp in strange ways due to perspective problems.

- smooth() is not completely implemented. there will be quirks in how
  it draws (like a weird flat line at the end of a shape, or areas
  that are less than smooth).

- on windows, processing can't be run from a folder that has non-ascii
  characters in its name.

- video examples sometimes crash the whole environment on windows

- jikes is ~9 megabytes in size, which is a bit obnoxious. it doesn't
  hurt anything but we plan to put it on a diet for a future release.

- net needs work, it's currently sending unicode, instead of ascii or
  UTF-8, data. this can cause problems with other programs.

- run.bat hasn't been given love for a while and may not work. at the
  very least, you'll need to modify it to find your copy of quicktime
  for java. 

- sound doesn't always stop when the 'stop' button is hit (i.e. the
  mixer example seems broken). for now, you have to first quit
  processing to stop it. 

- the horizontal scroller for the text area has some weirdness, this
  may not be fixed until after beta, depending on how bad it is.

- using saveFrame() or saveBytes() or some of those things will cause
  trouble inside applets. we'll try to do better error trapping soon
  so that your applet doesn't crash when this happens.

BUGS THAT WE PROBABLY CAN'T FIX
these are things that are out of our control


- "create font" crashes sometimes on windows, bringing down the whole
  environment. this seems to be a jdk bug, because it's not a java
  exception, but a full crash.
