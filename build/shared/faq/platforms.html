Supported Platforms
      </b><br><br>
The processing development environment is tested most heavily on:
<OL>
<LI>Mac OS X 10.4
<LI>Windows XP
<LI>Fedora Core (Linux)
</OL>
Windows is by far the superior platform for running Java
applications. It's not because we like Windows the best but that's
just how it is. Java on Mac OS X is steadily improving (especially
when compared to Apple's previous efforts), but it's still far slower
than Windows and even the older Java that ran on Mac OS Classic.
We think OS X will be a great bet for the future, and Apple is
putting all their feeble weight behind it, hopefully it will evolve
somewhere. Java on the Intel Macs seems to significantly improve
performance. Hopefully improvements in stability and keeping the
releases up to date are not far behind. Unfortunately Apple seems to
have a somewhat arrogant attitude about Java and wants everyone to
code their applications using things like Cocoa, perhaps missing the
point of their current marketshare.
<br> <br>
Windows 95/98/ME is a piece of crap, but since lots of people (are
often forced to) use it, we'll do our best to support it. Windows 95 is
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/win95.xml">not supported</a>.
Releases seem to often have trouble with 98/ME, so if possible, we
<em>strongly</em> recommend using Windows 2000 or XP. We won't be
testing on 95/98/ME or supporting it any more than we absolutely must.
<br> <br>
For the Linux version, you guys can support yourselves. If you're
enough of a hacker weenie to get a linux box set up, you oughta know
what's going on. For lack of time, we won't be testing extensively
under linux, but would be really happy to hear about any bugs or
issues you might run into. Actually, we don't get happy that you're
having issues, but if you're going to have issues, we're happy that
you tell us about them, so we can fix them.

      Windows
      </b><br><br>
Windows XP is used as one of the primary development platforms, 
so the release will likely work best there.

<!--
<br> <br> 
Windows 95/98/ME seem to have some trouble, but we think it's just with
the .exe that we use, so hopefully that'll get fixed in the
      future. You can try using the 'run.bat' file instead, and see if
      that works better.
-->

<br> <br>
The release is split into versions with and without Java. The non-Java
      version is only recommended for people who know what they're
      doing and have Java 1.4 installed. If you have trouble getting
      Processing to run properly, one of the first things you should
      try is downloading the version that includes Java, rather than
      the one without.

Mac OS X
      </b><br><br>
The most current release is tested on Mac OS X 10.4.x. We only test 
on 10.2.8 or 10.3.9 if there's a specific issue raised. We still
      intend to support 10.3.9 for a while (but not earlier 10.3.x
      release) and will only support 10.2.8 if it's
something we can fix without too much trouble. Your mileage may
vary if you're running something else. Actually, your mileage
will vary no matter what, because who knows what this software
is gonna do. You're playing with free, beta-quality software. 
Get psyched!
<br> <br>
<UL>
<LI>As of January 2006, we're starting to support Mac OS X 10.4, which
will be the primary development platform.
<LI>Using Java 1.5 (J2SE 5.0) is <A HREF="#java">strongly
discouraged</A>, as I suspect that it causes even more headaches on OS
X than it does on Windows. 
<LI>On Mac OS X 10.3, be sure to use Software Update to update to the most recent version of Java 1.4. Early releases had several problems (i.e. "Present" mode being broken) In addition, the Mac OS X 10.3.9 update causes Processing to crash on startup, or might cause Safari to crash when running Java applets. 
Apple has fixed the issue with 
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301382">this
update</a> which is also available from the Software Update Control
Panel. Bottom line, just keep your machine up to date and you should
be all set.
<LI>Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) is the minimum version that will run the Processing environment. If you want to run Processing itself on Mac OS X 10.2, you must install Java 1.4 via Software Update, and in fact, install absolutely everything available to get you up to 10.2.8, and all the security fixes. Revision 85 did not run properly on 10.2, but this has been fixed for 86. "Present" mode does not work on 10.2 because of apparent bugs in Apple's implementation of Java's full screen mode. 

<LI>Mac OS X 10.1 and 10.0 won't run the Processing environment, but should run applets that have been created with it. Make sure that Java is as up-to-date as possible (via Software Update). 

<LI>Mac OS 9 was a big headache, and we badly wanted to support it (since many people still use it), but it had to be discontinued for lack of time to work on it. As of revision 85, applets exported from Processing won't work on Mac OS 9 either, but that should return with a coming release of Processing.
</UL>
Notes about Processing on Intel Macs:
<UL>
<LI>With the release of the affordable Mac Mini for Intel, we were
able to purchase one of these cute little fellers and start testing
Processing releases with it. The machine arrived exactly 24 hours from
when Stever left the stage, and we're working hard to make sure that
Processing for OS X on Intel is available way before Adobe has a
chance to charge you another $1200 for the 
Intel-native Creative Suite 3.
<LI>While older releases will run on the
Mactel machines, starting with revision 0104, the Processing
application itself is a Universal Binary. Release 0110 is the first to
support the OPENGL renderer on the Intel Macs. 
<LI>Java, thankfully, is already native on the new Intel Macs, so the
improvement that comes from the faster bus/processor is a big help,
and the ways in which the Intel chips aren't faster than PPC (Altivec,
heavy media stuff) should have little effect on Java/Processing (yes,
contradictory, since we're doing graphics things, right? but I don't
have the impression that Java was optimized heavily to use Altivec and
media hooey that's lost on the Mactels). 
<LI>The serial library still has not been ported to a Universal Binary (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=311">Bug 311</A>).
I spent some time building rxtx to be a universal binary, but who
knows what sort of endian issues lurk underneath and I haven't had
time to test the thing since getting an Intel Mac.
</UL>

      <b>Linux</b><br>
      <br>
The Processing application is just a shell script, you can use this
as a guide to getting Processing to run with your specific configuration,
because who knows what sort of setup you have. this release was tested
on a Fedora Core 3, and Sun's Java Runtime Environment 1.4.2 is
included with the download. Replacing (or making a symlink to) the
contents of the &lsquo;java&rsquo; folder will let you tie in a
preferred Java VM for your machine.
<br> <br>
Getting Processing to run on Linux can be tricky, mostly because of Jikes. 
Some information on getting it to work can be found 
<a href="bugs.html#wontstart">here</a> under the Linux section. Similar to 
the Java folder, you can symlink a proper jikes in place of the distributed
version and you should be all set. However make sure that you're using 
Jikes 1.22, otherwise things may not work properly.
<br> <br>
If anyone out there knows how to properly build a version of Jikes that's 
compatible across all (or at least a wide range of) distros, please 
<a href="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Collaboration">let us know</a>. We're not Linux gurus so we don't know all the tricks.
<br> <br>
Using Fedora Core 4, I had to install compat-libstdc++-33 and xorg-x11-deprecated-libs in order to get things to run properly with the current distribution. Let's hear it for library dependencies!

      Because Processing is written in Java, it should run on any platform

      Irix, AmigaOS, BeOS... whatever, you should download the Linux
      version, and replace the &ldquo;java&rdquo; folder and jikes application
      with versions that support your platform. Then mess with the

Java Versions (1.1, 1.3, 1.4...)
</b><br> <br>
      There are several versions of Java, each with a different story. The versions 
      from 1.2 to 1.4 are also referred to with names like "Java 2 SDK 1.2" or 
      "J2SE 1.4" (Java 2 Standard Edition 1.4). J2SE is different from the trimmed-down 
      J2ME ("Micro Edition") which runs on mobile devices, and J2EE ("Enterprise 
      Edition") which contains more "enterprise" related bloat. In a moment of 
      further anti-user marketing genius, Sun recently decided to call the latest 
      release "Java 5.0" when promoting, but it's Java 1.5 to developers. Awesome! <UL> 
      <LI>Java 1.0 &mdash; a long, long time ago in 1995&hellip;
<LI>Java 1.1 &mdash; this was the first truly usable version of
Java. It's the last version of Java that was supported by Microsoft,
but has since been discontinued because of a lawsuit by Sun. Informal
estimates show that about 40% of web users that are using Java are 
still using Java 1.1. As of beta, Processing does not support 1.1 (it
requires 1.3) but we hope that this is only a temporary change,
because 1.1 support is obviously important.
<LI>Java 1.2 &mdash; was a mess, and was mercifully replaced by 1.3.
<LI>Java 1.3 &mdash; took all the features added in 1.2 and made them
usable. This is the current minimum required installation for
applets exported from Processing beta. Java 1.3 (and 1.4) is installed
on all Mac OS X machines. Windows users must download from 
<a href="http://java.com">java.com</a>. Because the Java plug-in on
Windows urges people to upgrade to 1.4 or 1.5, very few people appear
to be using 1.3 on the web any more. 
<LI>Java 1.4 &mdash; this is required for running the
Processing environment itself, and the one that receives the most
testing from us. It is the version of Java that is included with the
Windows download of Processing.
Java 1.4 is also installed by default on Mac OS X. 
Windows users must download from <a
href="http://java.com">java.com</a>.
It's used by about a 30%
of the people with Java installed.
Most Linux users will have Java 1.4 or later if it is installed.
<LI>Java 1.5 &mdash; the very latest version of Java. We don't support it and recommend that you avoid using it, as we don't test with it and it appears that it may be the slowest (certainly most bloated) release of Java yet. For instance, if you have Java 1.5 installed but are using the Processing download that includes Java, you may be surprised to see that things run more slowly when run in a browser than when run from inside Processing itself. It is also not possible to use any of the new syntax introduced in Java 1.5 within Processing, even if you have 1.5 installed (the preprocessor and compiler used by Processing don't understand the 1.5 syntax). Unfortunately, 1.5 still accounts for about 30% of the people (almost entirely Windows users) who have Java installed.
For Mac OS X 10.4, it was (at least initially) released as a separate
download, and will not be available on anything earlier than 10.4. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=175">Bug 175</A>)
<LI>Java 1.6 &mdash; I dread the day that this beast, known as
"Tiger", will leap from his cage in Santa Clara. I fear for the way
this Tiger will claw away at my time and productivity and leave me a
carcass of RSI and frustration. Sun in their infinite awesomeness has
decided that they've really been having trouble stuffing the JDK
releases full of enough bloat and confusing the market to the full
extent their capable, so they've
accelerated the release schedule for Java 1.6 to arrive much sooner
than the gap between Java 1.4 and 1.5. I'm sorry, I mean the time
between the release of Java 2 Standard Edition and Java 2 Standard
Edition 5.0. They were originally targeting <EM>nine months</EM>,
though it doesn't look like they're gonna make it. The 68 MB footprint
of the Java 1.5 runtime just doesn't cut the mustard anymore, nor do
the 12,931 class files in the runtime jar file. Plus, the new syntax
features of Java 1.5 just don't feel like it's quite as confusing as
C++ yet, so I'm sure we can get a little further out on snorting the
syntactic sugar. I'm starting a betting pool on how bloated and buggy
this thing will be, the loser has to moon either Scott McNealy or James
Gosling, chosen at the discretion of the winners. Or if they add
#define to the syntax, that means we all lose and have to switch to C#
and Visual Studio.
