Supported Platforms
      </b><br><br>
The processing development environment is tested most heavily on:
<OL>
<LI>Mac OS X 10.3
<LI>Windows XP
<LI>Fedora Core (Linux)
</OL>
Windows is by far the superior platform for running java
applications. It's not because we like Windows the best but that's
just how it is. Java on Mac OS X is steadily improving (especially
when compared to apple's previous efforts), but it's still clunky and
behind. We think OS X will be a great bet for the future, and Apple is
putting all their feeble weight behind it, hopefully it will evolve
somewhere.
<br> <br>
Developing the version for Mac OS 9 was a big headache, and we badly 
wanted to support it (since many people still use it), but it had to
be discontinued for lack of time to work on it.
<br> <br>
Windows 95/98/ME is a piece of crap, but since lots of people (are
often forced to) use it, we'll do our best to support it. Early alpha
versions seem to be having trouble with 95/98/ME, so if possible, we
<em>strongly</em> recommend using Windows 2000 or XP. 
<br> <br>
For the Linux version, you guys can support yourselves. If you're
enough of a hacker weenie to get a linux box set up, you oughta know
what's going on. For lack of time, we won't be testing extensively
under linux, but would be really happy to hear about any bugs or
issues you might run into. Actually, we don't get happy that you're
having issues, but if you're going to have issues, we're happy that
you tell us about them, so we can fix them.

      Windows
      </b><br><br>
Windows XP is used as the primary development platforms, 
so the release will likely work best there.
<br> <br> 
Windows 95/98/ME seem to have some trouble, but we think it's just with
the .exe that we use, so hopefully that'll get fixed in the
      future. You can try using the 'run.bat' file instead, and see if
      that works better.
<br> <br>
The release is now split into a version that does and does not include
      Java. The non-Java version is only recommended for people who
      know what they're doing and have Java 1.4 installed.

Mac OS X
      </b><br><br>
The most current release has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.3.8.
Your mileage may vary if you're running something else. Actually, your
mileage will vary no matter what, because who knows what this software
is gonna do. You're playing with free, beta-quality software. 
Get psyched!
<br> <br>
Mac OS X 10.3.9 was released just as we were preparing beta. On many
      machines (including mine), the update causes Safari to crash
      when running Java applets. Apple has fixed the issue with <a
      href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301382">this
      update</a> which is now available from the Software Update
      Control Panel. A previous solution was to reinstall <a
      href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/securityupdate2005002macosx1034orlater.html">Security
      Update 2005-002</a>, however it's not clear how these two
      solutions relate. More info is on the Apple update page.
<br> <br>
Minimum Requirements... To run Processing requires at least Mac OS X
      10.2 (Jaguar). Running applets exported from Processing should
      work on earlier versions of Mac OS X, so long as Java is as
      up-to-date as possible (via Software Update). If you want to run
      Processing itself on Mac OS X 10.2, you need to install Java
      1.4 via Software Update. For what it's worth, we don't test
      Processing under Mac OS X 10.2, and don't recommend it if you
      can avoid it. And if you're running 10.4, Processing is the 
      least of your worries. More information can be found at Apple's
      <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/faq/">Java FAQ</a>.

The Processing application is just a shell script, you can use this
as a guide to getting Processing to run with your specific configuration,
because who knows what sort of setup you have. this release was tested
on a Fedora Core 3, and Sun's Java Runtime Environment 1.4.2 is
included with the download. Replacing (or making a symlink to) the
contents of the &lsquo;java&rsquo; folder will let you tie in a
preferred Java VM for your machine.

      Because Processing is written in Java, it should run on any platform
      that supports Java 1.4. If you'd like to get it running on BSD,
      Irix, AmigaOS, BeOS... whatever, you should download the Linux
      version, and replace the &ldquo;java&rdquo; folder and jikes application
      with versions that support your platform. Then mess with the

Java Versions (1.1, 1.3, 1.4...)
</b><br> <br>
      There are several versions of Java, each with a different story. The versions 
      from 1.2 to 1.4 are also referred to with names like "Java 2 SDK 1.2" or 
      "J2SE 1.4" (Java 2 Standard Edition 1.4). J2SE is different from the trimmed-down 
      J2ME ("Micro Edition") which runs on mobile devices, and J2EE ("Enterprise 
      Edition") which contains more "enterprise" related bloat. In a moment of 
      further anti-user marketing genius, Sun recently decided to call the latest 
      release "Java 5.0" when promoting, but it's Java 1.5 to developers. Awesome! <UL> 
      <LI>Java 1.0 &mdash; a long, long time ago in 1995&hellip;
<LI>Java 1.1 &mdash; this was the first truly usable version of
Java. It's the last version of Java that was supported by Microsoft,
but has since been discontinued because of a lawsuit by Sun. Informal
estimates show that about 40% of web users that are using Java are 
still using Java 1.1. As of beta, Processing does not support 1.1 (it
requires 1.3) but we hope that this is only a temporary change,
because 1.1 support is obviously important.
<LI>Java 1.2 &mdash; was a mess, and was mercifully replaced by 1.3.
<LI>Java 1.3 &mdash; took all the features added in 1.2 and made them
usable. This is the current minimum required installation for
applets exported from Processing beta. Java 1.3 (and 1.4) is installed
on all Mac OS X machines. Windows users must download from 
<a href="http://java.com">java.com</a>. Because the Java plug-in on
Windows urges people to upgrade to 1.4 or 1.5, very few people appear
to be using 1.3 on the web any more. 
<LI>Java 1.4 &mdash; this is required for running the
Processing environment itself, and the one that receives the most
testing from us. It is the version of Java that is included with the
Windows download of Processing.
Java 1.4 is also installed by default on Mac OS X. 
Windows users must download from <a
href="http://java.com">java.com</a>.
It's used by about a 30%
of the people with Java installed.
Most Linux users will have Java 1.4 or later if it is installed.
<LI>Java 1.5 &mdash; the very latest version of Java. We don't
recommend using it if it can be avoided, as we don't test with it and
it appears that it may be the slowest release of Java yet. It's
currently not available for Mac OS X. But it still accounts for about
a 30% of the people that have Java installed.
