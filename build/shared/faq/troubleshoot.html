I've found a bug! 
      </b><br><br>
<em>I know you're excited, but please avoid the urge to just email
      us!</em> especially sending mail to Ben or Casey directly. This
      includes sending us "Instant Messages" on the discourse section
      of the site. While you may prefer the privacy of a personal
      message, it's much quicker for
      you to write to the board, where you'll find all sorts of
      helpful people who are also often at all hours of the night. If you
      email us directly, we'll either not respond or just ask you to
      use the discourse board anyway.
<br> <br>
<em>We spend a lot of
      our time helping people with Processing, so reading and
      following these instructions means that you respect our time and
      don't want to waste it.</em>
<br> <br>
First, read the FAQ. Start with digging through this page and maybe
      the <A HREF="platforms.html">platforms</A> page too in case it's
      something specific to your operating system. 
<br> <br>
Second, search the <a href="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">bug
database</a> to see if your problem has already been reported. 
Most often, this will contain background on the bug, a workaround, 
or hopefully a bit about its status. The bug database is unfortunately
      incomplete so it doesn't cover everything, but it will get
      better with time.
<br> <br>
If you don't find your bug, enter it as a new bug in
the database, which we use to keep track of things. If you're having
      trouble or find it confusing (or the word "database" gives you
      the willies), please post on the
      discourse board so that we can get you straightened out.
<br> <br>
When reporting please include information about
<OL>
<LI> the revision number (i.e. 0085)
<LI> what operating system you're using, and on what kind of hardware
<LI> a copy of the smallest possible piece of code that will
   produce the error you're having trouble with
<LI> details of the error, either the red spew that you see in the
console, or the last few lines from the files stdout.txt or stderr.txt 
from the 'lib' folder. 
</OL>
For stranger errors during compile time, you can also look inside the
build folder which contains an intermediate (translated into
java) version of your code. The build folder is in the same location
as preferences.txt: <br>
<UL>
<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; build
<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; 
Processing &rarr; build
<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; build
</UL>
The more details you can post, the better, because it helps us figure
out what's going on. Useful things when reporting:
<UL>
<LI> We want the minimum amount of code that will still replicate the
  bug. The worst that can happen is we get a report with a subject
  saying "problem!" along with a three page program. 
  Sure, everyone likes a puzzle, but simpler code will receive a 
  faster response. 
<LI> Occasionally we may need you to pack up a copy of your sketch folder 
  or something similar so that we can try and replicate the weirdness 
  on our own machine. Rest assured, we have no interest in messing with
  your fancy creations or stealing your ideas. The Processing team is
  a pair of straight-laced boys who hail from the midwestern U.S. who 
  were brought up better than that. and as we often lack enough time to
  build our own projects, we have even less time to spend figuring out
  other peoples' projects to rip them off.

      Processing won't start! Nothing happens when I click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;!
</b> <br> <br>
Windows
<UL>
<LI>If you're using the "without Java" download, try downloading the version that includes Java. Chances are, your machine has Java 1.5 installed, which is <A HREF="platforms#java">not supported</A> and causes lots of headaches. For instance, it won't play nice with some graphics cards and causes the Processing window to come up mostly blank.
<LI> Processing seems to have trouble starting when run from a user 
account that contains non-ascii characters. For instance, if your name 
contains Japanese characters or umlauts, it's likely to have trouble. 
Sometimes using run.bat instead will fix this. Another fix is to
create a user account that uses only ascii characters. In the meantime, 
we're looking for a fix. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49">Bug 49</A>)

<LI>If you have lots of garbage in your CLASSPATH environment
  variable, that might cause trouble starting up a sketch. You might
  get "Couldn't find package xxx.xxx" errors. Clean things up by avoiding
  spaces and quotes. This is because of Windows' awesome
  hokiness and its not-as-distant-as-it-should-be ancestor DOS. In the
  future, we'd like to detect errors like this before they cause
  trouble. That issue is being tracked at <A
  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=112">Bug 112</A>.
<LI>You might also try using run.bat to start processing. Lots
  of people seem to have a better time with this method.
<LI>Some graphics cards have conflicts with Java applications and
therefore Processing, which can cause the application to hang or
freeze. Under one scenario, disabling anti-aliasing on the card will
get rid of these problems (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=232">Bug 232</A>).
<LI>If you're still having trouble, try disabling any overly
  protective virus scanning software. It might be holding things up,
  especially when libraries have been imported.
</UL>
Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>First be sure that you're not trying to run Processing from the disk image. As with most programs, Processing needs to be copied to the Applications folder in order for it to run properly.
<LI>If it's still not working, open Console.app, found in Applications &rarr; Utilities &rarr; Console and see if there are any messages. If you don't know what they mean, post them to the discourse board where someone can help you out.
<LI>Using developer releases of Java is strongly discouraged. These can often cause problems and we can't possibly support them.
<LI>If you're running on Mac OS X 10.2, read the <a href="platforms.html#mac">platforms</a> section regarding things that may be broken.
<LI>Sometimes you might see the following error: <br>
<TT>dyld: /Applications/processing/jikes version mismatch for library:<br>/sw/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version of user: <br>
5.0.0 greater than library's version: 3.0.0)</TT> <br>
It seems that this happens when an older version of <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</A> is installed. In this case, you should either update or uninstall Fink. (thanks to Ryan Govostes for tracking this down)
</UL>
Linux
<UL>
<LI>If you get an error reading <TT>jikes: error while loading 
shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: 
No such file or directory</TT>,
It's because Processing requires libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 for jikes. 
You should either install it or, since it's old, install the rpm/package 
for compat-libstdc++ before Processing will run. Or find/rebuild a different 
version of jikes that's compatible with your distro. Jikes is available 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128803">here</a>, and it's an easy ./configure, make, and then copy src/jikes to the 
processing-XXXX folder and you should be all set. (<A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=47">Bug 47</A>)
<br> <br>
<LI>Or if you encounter a problem like this one: <TT>jikes: relocation
error: /opt/processing-0087/./jikes: undefined symbol:
__dynamic_cast_2</TT>, then that also means that jikes is incompatible
with your distro. (Also <A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=47">Bug 47</A>)
</UL>
Any Platform
<UL>
<LI> 
Errors inside code that is outside of setup() or draw() may just
hang/freeze Processing. For instance, with this code, if "blah.vlw" is
not in the "data" folder, it may just hang:
<PRE>  PFont font = loadFont("blah.vlw");

  void setup {
    // your awesome code
  }</PRE>
In general, a better practice is to use loadFont() (and
loadImage and the rest) inside of a function like setup().

Export and Browser Troubles
</b> <br> <br>
Sketches (applets) often have trouble once exported that will cause
errors in a browser. <br> <br>
To figure out what your problem is, you should first check the Java
(not JavaScript!) console. On Windows, right-click the coffee cup at
the right of the task bar, and select "Open Console". On Mac OS X, go
to Applications &rarr; Utilities &rarr; Console.app and see what the last
few error messages were.
<BR> <BR>
The most common cause is a security issue. For details on how to avoid
this, see <A HREF="export.html#signing">this section</A> of the FAQ. 
Java applets aren't allowed to do things like the following:
<UL>
<LI>Applets cannot open or write to files on the local machine. So
things like saveFrame() will cause an error when run from an
applet. To read files, make sure that you use "Add File..." to add the
file to your sketch (or place it in the data folder yourself) so that
it will be included when exported. Then, only use functions like
loadStrings(), loadImage(), openStream(), etc. to read data from your file.
<LI>Applets may not connect to servers other than the one from which
they came. If you need to redirect things from another server, you can
write a short script that will do it, understanding the possible
security consequences for your own machine.
<LI>Applets are also not allowed to do things like capture video or
audio. You don't want a malicious applet that turns on your webcam and
starts sending things back to their server.
<LI>
</UL>
Other issues:
<UL>
<LI>Another common problem is placing images or files into the sketch
folder by hand, rather than placing them in the data folder (or using
"Add File..." to do so automatically). This will work from the
PDE, but on export, the files won't be in included with your sketch
because they're not in the data folder.
<LI>Watch out for issues with capitalization! Windows and Mac OS don't
care about capitalization, so "blah.JPG" looks just the same as
"blah.jpg". However, since most servers run on Unix, capitalization
becomes a huge problem, because it must be exact. We've added some
checks to try and catch this (at least for images) but they're not
perfect. This can especially be a problem when the .JPG extension is
not even visible (the default on Windows), so you don't know whether
it's upper or lower case.
<LI>Your browser may be using an old version of an
applet. Unfortunately it's often difficult to get your browser to
flush its cache. You
may need to quit all instances of the browser, use alt-reload (or ctrl
or shift or option, who knows) to get the new version to show
up. On Windows, clicking the Java coffee cup at the right of the task
bar can bring up a control panel that will let you flush the Java
cache too. This is different across all platforms, but if someone
wants to write a good explanation for any platform they're familiar
with, please post on the <A
HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/">discourse</A> area of the site
and we'll add it to the FAQ.
</UL>
Some libraries simply don't work with the web (at least not for now):
<UL>
<LI><strike>You cannot use the OpenGL library from the web. (<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=166">Bug 166</A>)</strike> As of revision 0113, it's possible for applets that use the OPENGL renderer setting to run from the web.
<LI><STRIKE>The video library (both Capture and Movie) cannot be used on the
web</STRIKE> As of release 0115, it's possible to play back movies via the web,
however you still cannot capture video without a signed applet (see above).

      <b>
Out Of Memory Errors
</b> <br> <br>
There are two types of programs in Processing. Some are run from
inside the environment, but whenever you import a library, include a
code folder, or use "Present" to view your sketch, it will be run
as a separate Java program, which we sometimes call running "externally".
<br> <br>
To increase the amount of memory available to those programs, open
your preferences.txt file and edit the run.options line to include
something like:
<PRE>-Xms128m -Xmx1024m</PRE>
This will increase the amount of RAM to 128 megabytes of stack, and
1024 megabytes of heap (the latter being effectively usable RAM).
This will eventually be a setting that's added to the preferences
window (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=233">Bug 233</A>).
<br> <br>
Depending on your OS and available RAM, there are limits on how much
memory you can ask for. On Windows with 1G of RAM, it seems to be in
the neighborhood of 1.5 GB. Mac OS X seems to be somewhat similar, but
you mileage will vary with different versions of Java (1.3, 1.4,
1.5). Unfortunately this does place an upper bound on things that is
outside our control. You might look into the contributed Illustrator
or SVG vector export libraries that can be found on the libraries page
as another alternative for creating large format images.
<br> <br>
The preferences.txt file is stored in different locations on each
platform:
<UL>
<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; 
Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; preferences.txt
</UL>
To increase the amount of memory for Processing itself and for
sketches that are not running externally: 
<UL>
<LI>On Windows, try adjusting the parameters in the file 'run.bat' and
use that to run instead of Processing.exe. Short instructions can be
found inside that file. It appears that the maximum amount of RAM that
can be used on Windows is around 1.4 GB.
<br> <br>
<LI>On Mac OS X, right-click on Processing, select Show Package
Contents, then edit "Info.plist" inside "Contents". Change these
lines:
<PRE>&lt;key&gt;VMOptions&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;-Xms128M -Xmx256M&lt;/string&gt;</PRE>
to set to something higher than 128M and 256M (128 and 256 megabytes
of ram) as you need to (and at your own risk).
<br> <br>
<LI>On Linux, adjust the Processing shell script as needed.

      <b>
Why don't these Strings equal? 
</b> <br> <br>
Comparing a string (quoted text) is different in Processing (Java) than it is in
ActionScript, which often confuses people. For instance, while this
might make sense:
<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  if (lines[i] == "hello") { 
    println("hello found on line: " + i); // you'll never see this
  }
}</PRE>
You'll never see the message, even if "hello" is in the list. 
This is because a String is an <em>object</em>
in Java, comparing them with == will only compare whether the two
things are pointing at the same memory, not their actual
contents. Instead, use equals() or one of the other String methods:
<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  if (<B>lines[i].equals("hello")</B>) {
    println("hello found on line: " + i); // happiness
  }
}</PRE>

      <b>
Why does 2 / 5 = 0 instead of 0.4?
</b> <br> <br>
The result of dividing two integers will always be another integer:
<PRE>int a = 2;
int b = 5;
int result = a / b;
// result is zero</PRE>
While somewhat confusing at first, this is later useful for more
advanced programming. <BR> <BR>
To get fractions, use a 'float' instead: 
<PRE>float a = 2.0;
float b = 5.0;
float result = a / b;
// result is 0.4</PRE>
It is not enough to just divide two integers and set them to a float:
<PRE>float y = 2 / 5;</PRE>
In this case, integer 2 is divided by 5, which is zero, and then zero
is assigned to a float. The number doesn't become a float until the
lefthand side of the = sign. On the other hand, this:
<PRE>float y = 2.0 / 5;</PRE>
will work just fine. In this case, Java sees that 2.0 is a float, so
it also converts the 5 to a float so that they can be divided, which
makes it identical to:
<PRE>float y = 2.0 / 5.0;</PRE>
and because floats are being used on the righthand side, the result
will be a float, even before it gets to the lefthand side.

Common Issues (not bugs)
</b> <br> <br>
Things that are often perceived as bugs, but aren't actually 'broken'.

<UL>
<LI>If your code has methods (it's not just in static mode) or needs
to run over time, it must have a draw() method, otherwise nothing will
happen. 

<LI>Any code that accesses the pixels[] array should be placed inside <TT>beginPixels()</TT> and <TT>endPixels()</TT> (called loadPixels and updatePixels in versions 0115 and earlier, and not required prior to 0085). Strictly speaking, this isn't necessary for P2D and P3D, but is required for the OPENGL and JAVA2D renderer settings. It's best to simply get in the habit of using begin/end in your programs. A complete description can be found in the reference for the <A HREF="http://processing.org/reference/pixels.html">pixels[]</A> array.

<LI>PSound has been removed as of release 0112. Getting sound to work with Java is a total headache, and therefore something better left to a <A HREF="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/">library</A>. The Sonia and Ess libraries will both provide better audio support. We had hoped to provide a simple means to play audio clips and whatnot, but Sun's audio classes are too buggy across different platforms and different versions of Java. A buggy mess like that requires lots of code (and lots of testing across all our platforms), and we didn't want to muck up the core with that business. 

<LI>Unless you know what you're doing, you should not have a method 
in your sketch that's called run() (with no parameters, at least). 
This will break your sketch. Unfortunately, we can't explicitly disallow it, 
because some advanced programmers need to write their own run(). 

<LI><EM>Why doesn't saveFrame (or saveStrings or saveBytes) 
write things to the data folder?</EM>
   All saveXxxx() functions use the path to the sketch folder, rather than
   its data folder. Once exported, the data folder will be found inside the
   jar file of the exported application or applet. In this case, it's not
   possible to save data into the jar file, because it will often be running
   from a server, or marked in-use if running from a local file system.
   With this in mind, saving to the data path doesn't make sense anyway.
   If you know you're running locally, and want to save to the data folder,
   use <TT>saveXxxx("data/blah.dat")</TT>.

<LI>Objects with alpha (lines or shapes with an alpha fill or stroke,
images with alpha, all fonts) are displayed in P3D and OpenGL based on
their drawing order. This creates some annoying effects like making
things opaque if they're drawn out of order with objects above or
beneath them. This is simply how most 3D rendering works, but is
something that we'd like to hide from users in the future. 
As of revision 0114, the situation can be improved by adding 
<TT>hint(ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT)</TT> to setup(). However, the implementation
is far from perfect. It may improve things or it may not, better support
will arrive in a future release.
(<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=176">Bug 176</A>)

<LI> Names of sketches cannot start with a number, or have spaces
  inside. This is mostly because of a restriction on the naming of
  java classes. I suppose if lots of people find this upsetting, we
  could add some extra code to unhinge the resulting class name from
  the sketch name, but it adds complexity, and complexity == bugs. :)

<LI>Mind the capitalization of built-in functions. If a method or variable 
name is two words, usually the first word is lowercase and the first letter
of the second word will be capitalized. For instance: keyPressed, movieEvent, mouseX, etc. If you have a function called mousepressed(), it won't be called when mouse events occur, because it needs the capital P on 'pressed'.

<LI> If you get a "ClassCastException" when trying to run your code 
  in a browser, you're probably trying to run non-Java 1.1 compliant 
  code. This means any classes that didn't exist in java 1.1. Or, 
  if if you're exporting as applet, variables that are 'final int' 
  need to be 'static final int', otherwise they'll have trouble on 
  a maching that only has Java 1.1 installed (i.e. running Microsoft's 
  Java on Windows). You should also avoid using "final" variables 
  <em>inside</em> of methods, since those aren't supported by 
  Microsoft's VM (and that's the one most widely installed).

<LI>On Mac OS X, the error message: 
<tt>## Component Manager: attempting to find symbols in a component
  alias of type (regR/carP/x!bt)</tt> 
is not something from processing, it is a bug in Roxio Toast 5.2's Video
  CD Support extension. To suppress the messages, move "Toast Video CD
  Support.qtx" out of /Library/QuickTime (at least until you need to
  do Video CD work).

<LI>On Windows, sometimes your programs will run in a window that has a 
  Java coffee cup icon, instead of the usual Processing icon. This 
  simply means that the application is being run outside of Processing
  as an external application. This happens when extra libraries, 
  multiple source code files (more than one tab), or extra code files
  in the 'code' folder are employed.

<LI>A Processing sketch will attempt to use as much CPU as is available, 
unless framerate() is called. On Windows, this can sometimes cause audio
hiccups when an MP3 player is running at the same time, or another 
application is trying to do something simultaneously. To fix the audio
issue, add a delay(5) or delay(10) to your code, which will give five 
or ten milliseconds to other applications so they can breathe. For other
applications, you may have to set the framerate() lower, or use a longer
delay().

<LI>mouseX and mouseY always even (or always odd) numbers? By default,
Windows 2000 (and XP?) seems to skip every other pixel on the screen,
causing weirdness for some drawing applications done with Processing.
If you're seeing this, you can fix it by visiting Control Panels
&rarr; Mouse &rarr; Pointer Options &rarr; Enhance pointer precision.
(This was actually tracked down by someone else in the community,
whose name I have misplaced. If it was you, please drop me a line so
you can be properly cited. This kind of help is huge for us, since
we're such a small group!)

<LI>You may find that pmouseX and pmouseY have different values 
inside draw() and inside events like mousePressed() and mouseMoved().
This is because they're used for different roles, so don't mix them!
Inside draw(), pmouseX and pmouseY update only once per frame (once per trip
through your draw() method). 
Inside mouse events, they update each time the event is called. 
If they weren't separated, then the mouse would be read only once 
per frame, making response choppy. 
If the mouse variables were always updated multiple times per frame, 
using <NOBR><TT>line(pmouseX, pmouseY, mouseX, mouseY)</TT></NOBR> inside 
draw() would have lots of gaps, because pmouseX may have changed 
several times in between the calls to line(). Use pmouseX/Y inside draw()
if you want values relative to the previous frame. Use pmouseX/Y inside the
mouse functions if you want continuous response.
<LI>If your sketch is based on "Java mode", where you explicitly say
that the class extends PApplet, then the preprocessor assumes that you
know what you're doing. You'll have to make sure that your code is named
properly. This means that if you have "public class PooTime extends PApplet" 
at the beginning of your sketch, you bet your a-- the tab will need to be
named PooTime. If not, your code isn't gonna run. 
I mean, c'mon. you know what you're doing, right?
<LI>Don't name your sketch the same thing as a library or other class
that's used in your sketch. For instance, your sketch shouldn't be named
"Server" if you've imported the net library, because it already has a 
class named Server. You can be more creative than that.
<LI>When exporting to an application, the same deal applies with Java
mode and knowing what you're doing. See the notes on 
<A HREF="export.html#application">export to application</A>.

Problems with Video (Quicktime for Java)
</b> <br> <br>
Getting video to work can be kind of a cluster, particularly on
Windows. We use QuickTime for Java, which is sometimes difficult to
install or can be flakey. Someday in the future perhaps we can
circumvent this mess.
<br> <br>
The QuickTime 7 upgrade released April 29, 2005 (and now included with
iTunes 6) introduces its own unique set of problems. See caveats and fun
below for your platform.
<br> <br>
The message "This version of QuickTime for Java has expired" is an Apple bug,
and is fixed in the version of QuickTime that is included with iTunes
6.0.1 (or later), or, as of 20 October 2005, is available separate
from iTunes <A
HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone.html">here</A>.
<br> <br>
You can find more discussion about video and problems that people have
had over in the <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=VideoCamera">Video & Movies</A> section of the discourse board. And if you find a bug, please use the <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">bugs database</A>.
<br> <br>
Windows
<UL>
<LI>In order for camera input to work, you'll need to install a
QuickTime-compatible video digitizer (VDIG). Unfortunately, most
cameras on Windows don't support QuickTime right off the bat, but
we've had some luck with <a
href="http://www.vdig.com/WinVDIG/">WinVDIG</A>. Unfortunately, WinVDIG
1.0.5 seems to be quite broken (either doesn't work at all, or video
can't be resized), so you should stick with 
<A HREF="http://www.vdig.com/WinVDIG/WinVDIG_101.exe">WinVDIG
1.0.1</A>. 
<LI>Use the capture application included with the WinVDIG install to make sure that things are working properly (this helps us isolate WinVDIG vs. QuickTime for Java vs. Processing bugs).
<LI>If you've already installed WinVDIG 1.0.5, do an uninstall, and be sure to say "Yes To All" (or the equivalent for your language) when it asks whether you want to de-install the DLLs. 
<LI>If you're completely stuck on the WinVDIG problems, some have found happiness with this solution from pandaman: "I deleted the files vsVDIG from system32/quicktime AND program files/quicktime and deleted VSdump from system32- uninstalled vdig - reinstalled vdig 1.01 and things seem to be working now". It always makes us scared to go deleting things in System32, much less Program Files. But depending on your level of frustration, the possibility of hurting your Windows install may even sound enticing. Be sure to follow that line of instructions <EM>carefuly</EM>. I spent half an hour trying to reinstall WinVDIG on a student's machine because I missed some of it.
<LI>If you want to avoid QuickTime 7, use the <A
HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652forwindows.html">QuickTime
6.5.2</A> installer that's buried on Apple's site. Uninstall QuickTime
7 before installing 6.5 (see below). You will also have to use a
version of iTunes that's compatible with QuickTime 6 (anything earlier
than iTunes 6).
<LI>If you're installing QuickTime 6.5, you must make sure that
"QuickTime for Java" is included. During the
installation, use the "Custom" install, scroll down, and make sure the
checkbox next to "QuickTime for Java" is marked. You will also need to
follow this process if you have already installed QuickTime 6, and did
not use the "Custom" or "Full" install. To remedy this, use the
QuickTime Updater from the QuickTime folder that's added to the Start
menu.
<LI>For QuickTime 7 (iTunes 6 and later), you'll need to use release
0093 (or later) of Processing. QuickTime 7 causes 0092 and earlier to
break because Apple decided to move the location of several installed
files.
<LI>Better yet, you should use release 0102 (or later) of
Processing, which also fixes a number of QuickTime-related issues.
<LI>If you're still having trouble, sometimes a full uninstall/reinstall 
of Quicktime will do the trick. This may take a good bit of
work. First try using Add/Remove Programs to uninstall. At some point
you might get an "Error 1714" saying that "The older version of
QuickTime cannot be removed." The solution from Apple is to delete
C:\WINDOWS\TEMP, and then clean remnants of QuickTime from the
registry as outlined in <A
HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;290301">this</A>
Microsoft Support document. More discussion of installer-related
issues can be seen at <A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=171">Bug 171</A>.
<LI>Video sometimes likes to crash the application completely on
  Windows. This seems to be due to problems with QuickTime for Java
  (since we shouldn't be able to write code that crashes using
  Java.. heh right), so these situations are probably outside of our
  control.
<LI>pause() and framerate() aren't working with the video library.
(<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=370">Bug 370</A>)
</UL>

Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>If you're having problems since the QuickTime 7 update, one option
is to reinstall QuickTime 6. Apple has provided a QuickTime 6.5.2
reinstallers for <a
href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652reinstallerforquicktime701.html">QuickTime 7.0.1</a> and <a
href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652reinstallerforquicktime70.html">QuickTime
7.0</A> that you can use to return to your previous configuration. If
you're using QuickTime 7.0.3 or 7.0.4, you'll have to first downgrade
to 7.0.1, using the QuickTime 7.0.1 reinstaller for <A
HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime701reinstallerforquicktime703.html">QuickTime
7.0.3</A> or <A
HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime701reinstallerforquicktime704.html">QuickTime 7.0.4</A>.
<LI>On Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar, or Jagwyre if you like black turtlenecks),
QuickTime for Java was missing from the initial release of QuickTime
6.4. An upgrade to QuickTime 6.4 that includes QuickTime for Java is
available from software update. We don't recommend using 10.2 (we
don't have time to support it), so if you can move to Panther or
later, it's highly recommended.
<LI>If you get the following error:
<tt>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
  com/apple/mrj/macos/carbon/CarbonLock</tt>
then it means you need to update and/or reinstall QuickTime. There
  was some monkey business about QuickTime for Java updates being out
of sync with the Apple's Java updates, and this is one of the leftovers
of that scenario. Blame Apple. Blame Canada.
</UL>

Linux (or any platform besides Mac and Windows)
<UL>
<LI>The video library is only supported on Windows and Mac OS, because it relies on QuickTime for Java. There has been discussion of using other libraries (such as JMF) to bring support to Linux, search <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse">discourse</A> for more information.
</UL>

All Platforms
<UL>
<LI>Video performance is not particularly great. The library is simply not built (and Java is not currently capable) of moving around 640x480 video on most machines, much less doing analysis on the video. The library was intended as a way to get pixels and manipulate them (either small pixel buffers interactively, or large ones for non real-time use). There are better tools for real-time, large screen analysis. It is my estimate that a 2x performance increase can probably be obtained by making better use of the QuickTime for Java library, but this still may not be enough to do analysis of 640x480 pixels at 30 frames per second, so it remains a lower priority. As always <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/">contributions are welcome</A>, in case you're a video hacker who wants to help improve the library. (<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=40">Bug 40</A>)
<LI><STRIKE>Projects that use video cannot (currently?) be exported to the
web. (<A HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=44">Bug 44</A>)</STRIKE> As of release 0116, video playback runs just fine from the web, but video capture requires a signed applet (for security reasons). See the applet applet troubleshooting section for information about signed applets.
<LI>QuickTime movies are treated as nothing but pixel data in Processing. This means that none of the interaction features (fancy "click here to start movie" buttons and the like) are supported, and that other features such as QTVR won't work either.

Using the Serial Port
</b> <br> <br>
All Platforms
<UL>
<LI>If you're using a program to check to see if the serial port is working, then it won't be available to Processing. That means that if you're using HyperTerminal or whatever to see if your serial device is working, then you need to quit out of that application before using that port with Processing.
<LI>Serial.list() will only list the ports that are currently
available. So if you have a program that's using the serial port that
you want to use for your Processing sketch, it's not going to be
available, or even listed.
<LI>If you get an error reading something like this:<BR> <BR>
<TT>WARNING:  RXTX Version mismatch<BR>
Jar version = RXTX-2.0-4<BR>
native lib Version = RXTX-2.1-7pre17<BR>
 <BR>

<BR>
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library /Applications/processing-0090/libraries/serial/library/librxtxSerial.jnilib already loaded in another classloader</TT><BR><BR>
then you probably have another copy of RXTX installed somewhere. This
is a messy thing to straighten out, because it could be anywhere in
your PATH or CLASSPATH. Search your drive for RXTXcomm.jar or simply
comm.jar. Files that might cause trouble are libSerial.jnilib 
(on Mac OS X), libSerial.dll (Windows), jcl.jar, and
javax.comm.properties. (additional notes from stendahl)
</UL>
Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>
We use <a href="http://rxtx.org">rxtx</A> (formerly version 2.1_6, as of 0111 using version 2.1_7) to handle
serial I/O, which is included with the Processing release. If this is
the first time you're using rxtx, you'll need to make your way to the
"libraries" folder, find "serial", and inside, and run
macosx_setup.command (double-click it and follow the instructions).
This will make sure that things are properly set up (a few permissions
need to be changed). 
<LI>For Intel Macs, you'll need to use Processing release 0111 or later, this is the first version to have a Universal Binary for RXTX. 
<LI>If you ran the setup script on an earlier version of Processing, 
you'll need to re-run it (once) with release 0111 and later.
<LI>If you're getting a "serial port is already in
use by another application" it's possible that you haven't run the
setup script. On my machine, I installed the keyspan driver for my
usb-serial converter, ran the script, and then rebooted in order for
things to work (a reboot does the body good). 
<LI>In the past, I've used a keyspan 28X dual port adapter, 
and Serial.list() returns things like
<tt>/dev/cu.USA28X21P1.1</tt>. You'll probably have something
similar. Don't mind the frightening names.
<LI>Tom Igoe was kind enough to note that you'll be in a world of hurt
if you disconnect your serial adapter while a sketch is
running&mdash;it'll prolly freeze the machine and require a forced
reboot. This scenario may seem unlikely, but you might run into it if
your adapter is plugged into a USB keyboard, and you have the
keyboard plugged into a monitor/keyboard switcher. You know, those cheap
KVMs that everyone likes to talk about in relation to the Mac Minis? 
The ones that actually cost ~$150 and up?
<LI>The OS X 10.4 (Tiger) installer wipes out your permissions and groups
on /var/spool/uucp, so you'll have to run the setup command
again. However, running it returns:
<BR> <BR>
<TT>check_group_uucp(): error testing lock file    creation Error
details: Permission deniedcheck_lock_status: No permission to create
lock file. </TT> <BR> <BR>
Tom Igoe's extremely technical solution: &ldquo;After you have run the
macosx_setup.command, Shut down the machine and restart. <BR> <BR>
&ldquo;Don't logout then log back in.  Don't just restart.  Shut down and restart.  I don't care that you've got a record uptime you're trying to preserve. SHUT DOWN AND RESTART! Don't be an idiot like I was.  This will free up the old lock files, which apparently carry over from the previous systems, and your serial devices will be happy.
<BR> <BR> 
&ldquo;And on that note, Tiger and Processing are playing happily together with a serial port, like kittens with a ball of string.&rdquo;
</UL>
Linux
<UL>
<LI>Linux also uses rxtx-2.1_7 (just like Mac OS X). If you're 
having trouble getting things to run, i.e. the port menu stays grayed 
out or you get error message spew to the console when starting the 
application saying "Permission denied" and "No permission to create 
lock file", this is because you probably need 
to add yourself to both the uucp or lock groups so that processing 
can write to /var/lock so it doesn't get in a fight with other 
applications talking on the serial port. 
<LI>Alan Kilian contributes this description:
<OL>
<LI> I did an ls -l /dev/ttyS0 and saw that the group was set to uucp.
<LI> Then I edited /etc/groups, I found the uucp group, and I added my 
   login ID to the uucp line.
<LI> I logged out, and logged back in again.
<LI> The "groups" command now showed I was in group uucp, and when I 
   started processing, the serial port menu item was not greyed-out.
</OL>
It's important that you're in both groups, and that you completely
log out and log back in again.
<LI>Running processing as root will often get rid of the errors, but
that's obviously not a good solution for a million reasons (among 
them: beta code that runs as root and handles files? yeah great...)

OpenGL Issues
</b> <br> <br>
<UL>
<LI><EM>Try updating your drivers</A>. 
If you're getting a blank screen with sketch that uses OpenGL, 
or the sketch is hanging or starting very slowly, you likely need to
update your drivers. Release 0110 and later use a newer version of
<A HREF="http://jogl.dev.java.net">JOGL</A>, which requires a software
update for some video cards. On Windows, updated drivers are available
from your machine's vendor, Windows Update, or the manufacturer of
your graphics card. On Mac OS X, use Software Update to make sure your
system is up to date. For instance, OS X 10.4.2 has problems with 
0110+ that are fixed in later releases of 10.4.x.

<LI>We don't recommend running other OpenGL programs while running
  Processing in OpenGL mode. GL tends takes charge of things so
  results will be unexpected (windows from the other app showing
  through to the Processing window, etc.)

<LI>OpenGL is really memory hungry because of how tetxures work. In
OpenGL mode, your images as the next power of two larger in either
direction. This means an image that's 40x190 pixels will be stored as
a 64x256 pixel x 4 bytes per pixel array (along with the original
image storage being width x height x 4). This is probably something we
can optimize in the future, however no attempt will be made until the
surrounding code is debugged. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150">Bug 150</A>)

<LI>OpenGL sketches cannot be exported to run in a browser. The export
probably won't give an error, but they won't run properly. It's not
clear whether this is something that we can fix for the future.

<LI>OpenGL requires Java 1.4 or later. 

<LI>If you're getting a blank screen or strange graphics on Windows, 
try messing with your graphics card settings (or even with a different
graphics card). There are lots of options that can cause trouble (if
you run into such a situation, please post to the board on how you got
it fixed).

<LI>If you're getting this error on Windows: 
<tt>"net.java.games.jogl.GLException: Unable to enumerate pixel formats 
  of window using wglGetPixelFormatAttribivARB: 0"</tt>
and your machine has built in "Intel" graphics (this is the case for 
  many Dell machines, for instance) you may just need an updated version 
  of your driver, which can be found 
<a href="http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df/Detail_Desc.asp?sType=prev&agr=N&ProductID=865&DwnldID=7919">here</a>. 
Of course, read the page closely and make sure that you in fact have
this graphics chipset on your machine before installing. Thanks to
Daniel Shiffman for finding this fix.

<LI><STRIKE>On Mac OS X, I don't think there's much we can do about the
  following error: <tt>Error: view not ready, cannot lock focus at 
  "/Users/kbr/JavaNet/jogl/src/native/jogl/
   MacOSXWindowSystemInterface.m:createContext:51"</tt>
  that shows up sometimes on Run. Just hit Run again and things oughta
  work. This may be our bug, but who knows.</STRIKE> "Cannot lock
  focus" bug on OS X is fixed for Processing release 93, thanks to
  toxi for tracking it down as fixed with a new JOGL release.

<LI>On Windows, if you're getting a lot of OpenGL crashing, blue
screens, or other mess, your driver might be bad (really!) 
For instance, if you're using a Dell, use the driver they provide 
(<a href="http://support.dell.com">support.dell.com</a>) instead of what
might be a more recent driver obtained directly from nvidia.com.

Things that we probably can't fix
</b> <br> <br> 
Some things are out of our control, or not actually bugs...
<br> <br>

All Platforms
<UL>
<LI>A long sketch menu that goes off the edge of the screen? Doesn't
  scroll properly? There's not much we can do. This is a java issue which
  happens on most platforms. To get around it, you can organize your
  sketches into subfolders which will appear as submenus (be sure to
  quit before reorganizing, and then restart when finished). 
  (<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=391">Bug 391</A>)
<LI>If you're seeing a <TT>sun.dc.pr.PRException</TT>, it's because
  you're trying to draw something that's waaaaay off screen (like an x
  coordinate of -100,000 or something nutty like that). (<A
  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=104">Bug 104</A>)
</UL>

Windows
<UL>
<LI>The system clock sometimes goes weird, especially when
  using framerate() or delay(). This is a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4500388">long-standing bug</a> with the
  Windows version of the Java VM.
  According to someone on the sun site: This bug has been fixed in 
  bug no 4500388 and one requires a PRODUCT FLAG to use the fix.
  This flag and fix are available in 1.3.1_4, 1.4.0_2, 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.
  But for Java to actually use the fix: <br>
  Open your Java Plug-in Control Panel in the section 'Java Runtime 
  Parameters' just enter: -XX:+ForceTimeHighResolution
<LI>Create Font sometimes crashes on Windows, bringing down the whole
  environment. This seems to be a Java bug, because it's not a Java
  exception, but a full crash. (<A
  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=99">Bug 99</A>).
<LI>An error starting with <tt>"hs_err_pid10XX.txt"</tt> 
sometimes shows up. This is something within the Sun's Java VM that
we can't fix. It's not clear what the problem is, but it seems to have
shown up with java 1.4.
</UL>
Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>
An error that reads something like 
<TT>2005-05-19 14:20:44.209 java[875] _initWithWindowNumber: error
creating graphics ctxt object for ctxt:72059, window:26969</TT> is a
known bug in Apple's Java implementation. (<A
HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=53">Bug 53</A>)
<LI>
Sometimes something like the following will come up: <TT> ***
malloc[438]: Deallocation of a pointer not malloced: 0xffffffff; This
could be a double free(), or free() called with the middle of an
allocated block; Try setting environment variable MallocHelp to see
tools to help debug </TT> it seems to be a bug in Apple's OS X
Java. It doesn't appear to hurt anything but there also doesn't appear
to be anything we can do to fix it. (<A
HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=52">Bug 52</A>)
</UL>
Linux
<UL>
<LI>The following message (or messages like it) on startup: 
<tt>Warning: Cannot convert string
"-b&h-lucida-medium-r-normal-sans-*-140-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1" to type
FontStruct</tt>. This is just a Java issue, but doesn't seem to 
affect things.

And of course, if these and others give you a burr in the
saddle, <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org">join us</A> and help!
<UL>
<LI>Java 1.1 support has been (temporarily) removed from this
release. We hope to bring it back, but it will take some time and we
didn't want to hold up beta any longer. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=125">Bug 125</A>)
<LI>The stop button sometimes doesn't stop things properly (especially
when using libraries). Closing the window to shut things down usually
works fine, though even that might lock up sometimes. Make sure you
save your sketches before you run, in case you have to force-quit. If
this happens to you, please post information about it at <A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=126">Bug 126</A>.
<STRIKE><LI> &ldquo;Export to Application&rdquo; remains unimplemented, 
though we're hoping to have it complete soon. (<A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=60">Bug
60</A>)</STRIKE> Export to Application works in 0097.
<LI>Pixel operations (get(), set(), blend(), loadPixels(), updatePixels(), 
filter(), etc. there are others) are fairly broken when using OpenGL. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=91">Bug 91</A>)
<LI>The size of exported applets is larger than we would like, but
we'll get things smaller and more optimize again. Having separated the
2D and 3D libraries, eventually we won't have to include the 3D code
when using 2D. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=127">Bug 127</A>).
<LI><STRIKE>println() can be super slow and often locks things
up</STRIKE> println() issues fixed for Processing release 93.
<LI><STRIKE>Dragging the applet window around will often make
Processing lock up</STRIKE> Fixed in a recent release.
<LI>2D graphics might be a bit flickery sometimes, try setting the
framerate() to get things under control (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=122">Bug 122</A>)
<LI>strokeWeight() is disabled in P3D and OPENGL. Not really a bug
per se (how do you define a stroke in 3D?), but something we'd like to
fix someday. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=123">Bug 123</A>)
<LI>The placement of applets that are 100x100 is sometimes weird. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=128">Bug 128</A>)
<LI><STRIKE>Sometimes things lock up when there are errors in code,
for instance, when using libraries like OpenGL, video, or
net.</STRIKE> (fixed in the early 90s releases, please re-file a bug
if you run into it)
<LI><STRIKE>Errors sometimes don't come through, or are
InvocationTargetExceptions, particularly on the Mac.</STRIKE> (if this
hasn't been fixed please re-file a new bug)
<LI>int() and float() don't always work, use ((int) blah) or ((float)
blah) instead for the time being. or toInt(blah) and toFloat(blah). (<A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4">Bug 4</A>)
<LI>The beloved(?) "History" function from previous versions is
missing. In the meantime, "Archive Sketch" might be useful. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71">Bug 71</A>)
<LI>Need to complete the "Tools" menu, which will be a way for people
to develop their own editor plug-ins. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=124">Bug 124</A>)
<LI>When you have too many tabs, things get ugly (<A
HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54">Bug 54</A>)
<LI>Save changes before quitting needs a "Cancel" button. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=32">Bug 32</A>)
<LI>Error messages after you hit Run are often too long to read or too
weird to understand
(<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=57">Bug 57</A>)
<LI><STRIKE>updatePixels() seems to stink on the Mac. It can sometimes
cause the screen to not update properly, or for video to contain weird
bands of mixed frames.</STRIKE> Fixed in release 91.
<LI>Lots of little UI things like proper focus or key shortcuts
