To learn the Processing language, we recommend you try a few of the examples,

<A HREF="">reference</A>. 
<br> <br>
When using the examples (or trying someone else's code), 
if you run across a function that you're not familiar with, 
highlight the word, right-click (ctrl-click on the mac), 
and select "Find in Reference" to open the reference page
for that keyword. This can be helpful for understanding how
programs work.

The Processing development environment is released as open source

released under an LGPL license, which means they can be used 
      as a library and included in your project without you having to open up 
      your code (though we encourage people to share anyway). But if
      you make changes to core, you have to submit back to us.

Processing also relies on other open projects, namely:
<UL>
<LI>the older <A

distributed under a BSD-style license as part of the

We need help! Having shared all the code and made it available for

What's with the version numbers?

This is not 1.0 software.. It's buggy and may kill people. That's part
of why we used to make everyone sign up to download, so that we know that you 
care enough to bother and have more of an inkling of what you're 
getting into.
<br> <br>
At least until the final 1.0 version, we'll be using four digit
numbers for the release. Revision 0085 was the first "beta" release, 
which means that all the features are in, but not all the bugs
are out. There remain several known issues with the beta release 
that will need to be sorted out before we're comfortable calling 
a release an actual final 1.0.
<br> <br>
      The numbered releases aren't always heavily tested, so don't be surprised 
      if/when something breaks. Check the <A HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/">bugs</A> 
      section of the site and report the problem if it's new, and in the meantime, 
      you can go back to the previous numbered release until there's a fix. </td>

      <b>Why is it called &ldquo;Processing&rdquo;?</b><br>
      <br>
      At their core, computers are processing machines. They modify, move, and 
      combine symbols at a low level to construct higher level representations. 
      Our software allows people to control these actions and representations 
      through writing their own programs. The project also focuses on
      the &ldquo;process&rdquo; 
      of creation rather than end results. The design of the software supports 
      and encourages sketching and the website presents fragments of projects 
      and exposes the concepts behind finished software. 
      <br> <br>
&ldquo;Proce55ing&rdquo; is the spelling we originally used for the url. Even 
though it's a combination of numbers and letters, it was simply
pronounced &ldquo;processing.&rdquo; We saved our pennies and had a can
drive so now we've since acquired the processing.org domain name. 
As a result we are no longer using the name &ldquo;Proce55ing.&rdquo;
When we see it with the 55's it annoys us and we want to punch people 
in the face. Or punch ourselves in the face for using it 
in the first place. Actually, we try not to be that emotional about it
      but we're trying to kill off the previous naming. However, to
      make it more confusing, we sometimes still use &ldquo;p5&rdquo;
      (not p55) as a shortened version of the name.

What is the sketchbook? What do you mean by sketches?
      </b><br><br>
We think most &ldquo;integrated development environments&rdquo; 
(Microsoft Visual Studio, Codewarrior, Eclipse, etc.) tend to be
overkill for the type of audience we're targeting with Processing. For
this reason, we've introduced the 'sketchbook' which is a more lightweight 
way to organize projects. As trained designers, we'd like the process 
of coding to be a lot more like sketching. The sketchbook setup, and
the idea of just sitting down and writing code (without having
to write two pages to set up a graphics context, thread, etc) is
a small step towards that goal. 
<br> <br>
The idea of just writing a short piece of code that runs very easily
(via a little run button) is a direct descendant of John Maeda's work
in <A HREF="http://dbn.media.mit.edu">Design By Numbers</A>, and 
our experiences maintaining it. 
(Yes, other languages and environments have done this first,
but in our case, the concept is drawn from DBN).

Why Java? Or why such a Java-esque programming language?
      </b><br><br>
We didn't set out to make the ultimate language for visual
programming, we set out to make something that was:
<OL>
<LI> a sketchbook for our own work, simplifying the majority 
   of tasks that we undertake, 
<LI> a teaching environment for that kind of process, and
<LI> a point of transition to more complicated or difficult 
languages like full-blown Java or C++ (a gateway drug to 
more geekier and more difficult things)
</OL>
At the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and
simplicity of use. i.e. if we didn't care about speed, Python, Ruby
or many other scripting languages would make far more sense
(especially for the simplicity and education aspect of it). 
If we didn't care about transition to more advanced languages, 
we'd get rid of the crummy C-style (well, algol, really) syntax. 
etc etc.
<br> <br>
Java makes a nice starting point for a sketching language because it's
far more forgiving than C++ and also allows users to export sketches for
distribution via the web. 
<br> <br>
Processing is not intended as the ultimate environment/language (in
fact, the language is just Java, but with a new graphics and 
utility API along with some simplifications). Fundamentally, 
Processing just assembles our experience in building things, 
and trying to simplifies the parts that we felt should be easier.

Dude, Where's the Timeline? This Sucks&hellip; / Awesome! A Flash Killer! 
</b><br> <br>
We're not targeting Flash. If we wanted to make a Flash killer, we'd
have set out to do that and our stated purpose would have been more
specific (and we'd have more on the site about "Processing vs. Flash"
in the competitive shootout sense... right now we just have
information about how the syntax differs so that people can make the
transition).
<br> <br>
We could have saved a lot of time if we just wanted to build a better
Flash. And in the end, as two people, do you really think we can or
should bother competing with a company as large as Macromedia?
Macrodobe? Does anyone really want a better Flash? 
 <br> <br>
There are things that are always going to be better in Flash,
and other types of work that will always be better in Processing. But
fundamentally (and this cannot be emphasized enough), there is no
all-or-nothing game&hellip; We're talking about tools. Do people refuse
to use pencils because pens exist? No, you just use them for different
things, and for specific reasons. If Processing works for you, then
use it. If not, don't. It's easy! It's free! You're not being forced
to do anything.
 <br> <br>
As we have heard, Flash 8 will be better at doing some of the pixel
editing/image stuff you can do in Processing, but there are still lots
of things we're covering that's not focused on moving pixels (OpenGL
acceleration, easy serial port access, video input) and other things
that are incomplete in beta but just around the corner ("Export to
Application" and more).

Why Is Processing Connecting to the Network?
      </b><br><br>
After you double-click Processing, it will check the site for
      updates. This is helpful so that we can keep people
      aware of the frequent updates to Processing. 
<br> <br>
In so doing, it also sends a random number that identifies yours as a
      unique machine (but sends no personal information to us). 
This really helps us get a general idea of how many people are using the
      software, which is really important for things like
      writing grants so that we can keep Processing free.
<br> <br>
If the network connection causes you trouble, it can be shut off
inside the Preferences window.
