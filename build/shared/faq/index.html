      The software is free to download.
      If you are interested in testing the BETA version of the software, 
      visit the <a href="http://processing.org/download/">download</a> 
      page and follow the instructions. 
<br> <br>
We think it's important to have Processing freely available, rather
than selling it for a million dollars under some godawful yearly
contract update scheme. To that end, we encourage people to spread
the word and refer them to the 
<A HREF="http://processing.org">processing.org</A> site.

To learn the Processing language, we recommend you try a few of the examples, 
read some of the <A HREF="">tutorials</A> and check out the 
<A HREF="">reference</A>. 
<br> <br>
When using the examples (or trying someone else's code), 
if you run across a function that you're not familiar with, 
highlight the word, right-click (ctrl-click on the mac), 
and select "Find in Reference" to open the reference page
for that keyword. This can be helpful for understanding how
programs work.

      We plan for this project to be open source under the GPL.

      as a library and included in your project without you having to open up 
      your code (though we encourage people to share anyway), unless
      you make changes to core, which you then have to submit back to

      at <A
      HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</A>.

Processing also relies on other open projects, namely the older version
of the <A HREF="http://www.savarese.org/oro/">ORO Matcher</A>,
the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jikes/">Jikes</A> compiler,

We like it when people include a "Built with Processing" note with a
link back to the site, since it helps create interest and brings in
more people to the project. We don't/can't/shouldn't require it, but
it makes us happy because the project is free and this is one way you
can help give back to us.
<br> <br>
You can also remove the source code from web pages that you export,
but in the spirit of the Processing project overall, we include it by
default so as to encourage sharing and learning from one another.
<br> <br>
You can distribute your sketches all you want, and commercial projects
should be just fine too, however we place no warranty on the software
(see the download page for the license shennanigans).

This is not 1.0 software.. It's buggy and may kill people. That's part
of why we used to make everyone sign up to download, so that we know that you 
care enough to bother and have more of an inkling of what you're 
getting into.
<br> <br>
At least until the final 1.0 version, we'll be using four digit
numbers for the release. Revision 0085 was the first "beta" release, 
which means that all the features are in, but not all the bugs
are out. There remain several known issues with the beta release 
that will need to be sorted out before we're comfortable calling 
a release an actual final 1.0.
<br> <br>
The numbered releases aren't always heavily tested, so don't be 
surprised if/when something breaks.. 
Check the <A HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/">bugs</A> section of the site) and 
report the problem if it's new, and in the meantime, you can 
go back to the previous numbered release until there's a fix.

      <b>Why is it called &ldquo;Processing&rdquo;?</b><br>
      <br>
      At their core, computers are processing machines. They modify, move, and 
      combine symbols at a low level to construct higher level representations. 
      Our software allows people to control these actions and representations 
      through writing their own programs. The project also focuses on
      the &ldquo;process&rdquo; 
      of creation rather than end results. The design of the software supports 
      and encourages sketching and the website presents fragments of projects 
      and exposes the concepts behind finished software. 
      <br> <br>
&ldquo;Proce55ing&rdquo; is the spelling we originally used for the url. Even 
though it's a combination of numbers and letters, it was simply
pronounced &ldquo;processing.&rdquo; We saved our pennies and had a can
drive so now we've since acquired the processing.org domain name. 
As a result we are no longer using the name &ldquo;Proce55ing.&rdquo;
When we see it with the 55's it annoys us and we want to punch people 
in the face. Or punch ourselves in the face for using it 
in the first place. Actually, we don't care that much but we're trying 
to kill off the previous naming. However, to make it more confusing, 
we sometimes still use &ldquo;p5&rdquo; (not p55) as a shortened
version of the name.

What is the sketchbook? What do you mean by sketches?
      </b><br><br>
We think most &ldquo;integrated development environments&rdquo; 
(Microsoft Visual Studio, Codewarrior, Eclipse, etc.) tend to be
overkill for the type of audience we're targeting with Processing. For
this reason, we've introduced the 'sketchbook' which is a more lightweight 
way to organize projects. As trained designers, we'd like the process 
of coding to be a lot more like sketching. The sketchbook setup, and
the idea of just sitting down and writing code (without having
to write two pages to set up a graphics context, thread, etc) is
a small step towards that goal. 
<br> <br>
The idea of just writing a short piece of code that runs very easily
(via a little run button) is a direct descendant of John Maeda's work
in <A HREF="http://dbn.media.mit.edu">Design By Numbers</A>, and 
our experiences maintaining it. 
(Yes, other languages and environments have done this first,
but in our case, the concept is drawn from DBN).

Why Java? Or why such a Java-esque programming language?
      </b><br><br>
We didn't set out to make the ultimate language for visual
programming, we set out to make something that was:
<OL>
<LI> a sketchbook for our own work, simplifying the majority 
   of tasks that we undertake, 
<LI> a teaching environment for that kind of process, and
<LI> a point of transition to more complicated or difficult 
languages like full-blown Java or C++ (a gateway drug to 
more geekier and more difficult things)
</OL>
At the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and
simplicity of use. i.e. if we didn't care about speed, Python, Ruby
or many other scripting languages would make far more sense
(especially for the simplicity and education aspect of it). 
If we didn't care about transition to more advanced languages, 
we'd get rid of the crummy C-style (well, algol, really) syntax. 
etc etc.
<br> <br>
Java is also far more forgiving than C++ and allows users to
exported sketches for distribution via the web. 
<br> <br>
Processing is not intended as the ultimate environment/language (in
fact, the language is just Java, but with a new graphics and 
utility API along with some simplifications). Fundamentally, 
Processing just assembles our experience in building things, 
and trying to simplifies the parts that we felt should be easier.
