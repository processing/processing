I've found a bug! 
      </b><br><br>
Haven't we all?
<br> <br>
<em>Please avoid the urge to just email us!</em> especially sending mail 
to Ben or Casey directly. While you may prefer the privacy of an
email, it's much quicker for you to ask the whole gang, who are super 
helpful. Visit the <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/">discussion 
board</A> to report problems, ask questions, or post suggestions.
If you email us, we'll probably just ask you to use the bboard anyway.
<br> <br>
First, search the <a href="http://processing.org/bugs/">bug
database</a> to see if your problem has already been reported. 
Most often, this will contain background on the bug, a workaround, 
or an estimated target for a fix.
<br> <br>
If you don't find your bug, you can either enter it as a new bug in
the database, or you can post to the bugs section of the <a
href="http://processing.org/discourse/">discussion board</a>.
<br> <br>
When reporting this "bug" please include information about
<OL>
<LI> the revision number (i.e. 0085)
<LI> what operating system you're using, and on what kind of hardware
<LI> a copy of the smallest possible piece of code that will
   produce the error you're having trouble with
<LI> details of the error, either the red spew that you see in the
console, or the last few lines from the files stdout.txt or stderr.txt 
from the 'lib' folder. 
</OL>
For stranger errors during compile time, you can also look inside the
build folder which contains an intermediate (translated into
java) version of your code. The build folder is in the same location
as preferences.txt: <br>
<UL>
<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; build
<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; 
Processing &rarr; build
<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; build
</UL>
The more details you can post, the better, because it helps us figure
out what's going on. Useful things when reporting:
<UL>
<LI> We want the minimum amount of code that will still replicate the
  bug. The worst that can happen is we get a report that says
  "problem!" along with a three page program. Sure, everyone likes a
  puzzle, but simpler code will receive a faster response. 
<LI> Occasionally we may need you to pack up a copy of your sketch folder 
  or something similar so that we can try and replicate the weirdness 
  on our own machine. Rest assured, we have no interest in messing with
  your fancy creations or stealing your ideas. The Processing team is
  a pair of straight-laced boys who hail from the midwestern U.S. who 
  were brought up better than that. and as we often lack enough time to
  build our own projects, we have even less time to spend figuring out
  other peoples' projects to rip them off.

      Processing won't start! Nothing happens when I click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;!
</b> <br> <br>
Windows
<UL>
<LI> Processing seems to have trouble starting when run from a user 
account that contains non-ascii characters. For instance, if your name 
contains Japanese characters or umlauts, it's likely to have trouble. 
Sometimes using run.bat instead will fix this, but in the meantime, 
we're looking for a fix.
<LI> In general, Processing probably won't work if you install it inside
  a folder with non-ascii characters in its name. For instance, if the
  name of your user folder includes Japanese characters, 
or it has an umlaut or cedilla or anything else fancy, you're gonna
  have trouble. The same sometimes happens when Processing is on the 
desktop, or somewhere inside that folder. The fix
  to place processing inside the root level of your C:\ drive (or
  whatever drive you use) and it'll be ok again. This will be fixed in
  the future.
<LI>If you have lots of garbage in your CLASSPATH environment
  variable, that might cause trouble starting up a sketch. You might
  get "Couldn't find package xxx.xxx" errors. Clean things up (avoid
  spaces and quotes)
<LI>In general, perhaps avoid having spaces in the folder name
  that contains Processing. This is because of Windows' awesome
  hokiness and its not-as-distant-as-it-should-be ancestor DOS.
<LI>If you're still having trouble, try disabling any overly
  protective virus scanning software. It might be holding things up.
<LI>You might also try using run.bat to start processing. Lots
  of people seem to have a better time with this method.
</UL>
Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>If you're running on Mac OS X 10.2, read the <a href="platforms.html#mac">platforms</a> section regarding things that may be broken.
<LI>Sometimes you might see the following error: <br>
<TT>dyld: /Applications/processing/jikes version mismatch for library:<br>/sw/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version of user: <br>
5.0.0 greater than library's version: 3.0.0)</TT> <br>
It seems that this happens when an older version of <a
  href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</A> is installed. In this
  case, you should either update or uninstall Fink. (thanks to ryan govostes for tracking this down)
</UL>
Linux
<UL>
<LI>If you get an error reading <TT>jikes: error while loading 
shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: 
No such file or directory</TT>,
It's because Processing requires libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 for jikes. 
You should either install it or, since it's old, install the rpm/package 
for compat-libstdc++ before Processing will run. Or find/rebuild a different 
version of jikes that's compatible with your distro. Jikes is available 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128803">here</a>, and it's an easy ./configure, make, and then copy src/jikes to the 
processing-XXXX folder and you should be all set.
<br> <br>
<LI>Or if you encounter a problem like this one: <TT>jikes: relocation error: /opt/processing-0087/./jikes: undefined symbol: __dynamic_cast_2</A>, then that also means that jikes is incompatible with your distro. 
</UL>
Any Platform...
<UL>
<LI> 
Errors inside code that is outside of setup() or draw() may just
hang/freeze processing if "blah.vlw" is not in the "data" folder. 
For instance this code:
<PRE>  PFont font = loadFont("blah.vlw");

  void setup {
    // your awesome code
  }</PRE>
In general, a better practice is to use loadFont() (and
loadImage and the rest) inside of a function like setup().

Out Of Memory Errors
</b> <br> <br>
There are two types of programs in Processing. Some are run from
inside the environment, but whenever you import a library, include a
code folder, or use "Present" to view your sketch, it will be run
as a separate Java program, which we sometimes call running "externally".
<br> <br>
To increase the amount of memory available to those programs, open
your preferences.txt file and edit the run.options line to include
something like:
<PRE>-Xms128m -Xmx1024m</PRE>
This will increase the amount of RAM to 128 megabytes of stack, and
1024 megabytes of heap (the latter being effectively usable RAM).
<br> <br>
The preferences.txt file is stored in different locations on each
platform:
<UL>
<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; 
Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; preferences.txt
</UL>
To increase the amount of memory for Processing itself and for
sketches that are not running externally: 
<UL>
<LI>On Windows, try adjusting the parameters in the file 'run.bat' and
use that to run instead of Processing.exe. Short instructions can be
found inside that file. It appears that the maximum amount of RAM that
can be used on Windows is around 1.4 GB.
<br> <br>
<LI>On Mac OS X, right-click on Processing, select Show Package
Contents, then edit "Info.plist" inside "Contents". Change these
lines:
<PRE>&lt;key&gt;VMOptions&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;-Xms128M -Xmx256M&lt;/string&gt;</PRE>
to set to something higher than 128M and 256M (128 and 256 megabytes
of ram) as you need to (and at your own risk).
<br> <br>
<LI>On Linux, adjust the Processing shell script as needed.

Common Issues (not bugs)
</b> <br> <br>
Things that are often perceived as bugs, which means maybe they'll be
changed in the future, but for now, they're not actually 'broken'.

<UL>
<LI> Names of sketches cannot start with a number, or have spaces
  inside. this is mostly because of a restriction on the naming of
  java classes. I suppose if lots of people find this upsetting, we
  could add some extra code to unhinge the resulting class name from
  the sketch name, but it adds complexity, and complexity == bugs. :)

<LI>Mind the capitalization of built-in functions. If a method or variable 
name is two words, usually the first word is lowercase and the first letter
of the second word will be capitalized. For instance: keyPressed, movieEvent, mouseX, etc. If you have a function called mousepressed(), it won't be called when mouse events occur, because it needs the capital P on 'pressed'.

<LI> If you get a "ClassCastException" when trying to run your code 
  in a browser, you're probably trying to run non-Java 1.1 compliant 
  code. This means any classes that didn't exist in java 1.1. Or, 
  if if you're exporting as applet, variables that are 'final int' 
  need to be 'static final int', otherwise they'll have trouble on 
  a maching that only has Java 1.1 installed (i.e. running Microsoft's 
  Java on Windows). You should also avoid using "final" variables 
  <em>inside</em> of methods, since those aren't supported by 
  Microsoft's VM (and that's the one most widely installed).

<LI> &ldquo;Export to Application&rdquo; remains unimplemented, 
though we're hoping to have it complete soon.

<LI>On Mac OS X, the error message: 
<tt>## Component Manager: attempting to find symbols in a component
  alias of type (regR/carP/x!bt)</tt> 
is not something from processing, it is a bug in Roxio Toast 5.2's Video
  CD Support extension. To suppress the messages, move "Toast Video CD
  Support.qtx" out of /Library/QuickTime (at least until you need to
  do Video CD work).

<LI>On Windows, sometimes your programs will run in a window that has a 
  Java coffee cup icon, instead of the usual Processing icon. This 
  simply means that the application is being run outside of Processing
  as an external application. This happens when extra libraries, 
  multiple source code files (more than one tab), or extra code files
  in the 'code' folder are employed.

<LI>mouseX and mouseY always even (or always odd) numbers? By default,
Windows 2000 (and XP?) seems to skip every other pixel on the screen,
causing weirdness for some drawing applications done with Processing.
If you're seeing this, you can fix it by visiting Control Panels
&rarr; Mouse &rarr; Pointer Options &rarr; Enhance pointer precision.
(This was actually tracked down by someone else in the community,
whose name I have misplaced. if it was you, please drop me a line so
you can be properly cited. This kind of help is huge for us, since
we're such a small group!)

<LI>Comparing a string is different in Processing (Java) than it is in
ActionScript. For instance, while this might make sense:
<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  if (lines[i] == "hello") { 
    println("hello found on line: " + i); // you'll never see this
  }
}</PRE>
You'll never see the message. Because a String is an <em>object</em>
in Java, comparing them with == will only compare whether the two
things are pointing at the same memory, not their actual
contents. Instead, use "equals" or one of the other String methods:
<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  if (<B>lines[i].equals("hello")</B>) {
    println("hello found on line: " + i); // happiness
  }
}</PRE>

Problems with Video (Quicktime for Java)
</b> <br> <br>
The QuickTime 7 upgrade released April 29, 2005 has not been tested with the video library. If you're working on a critical project that uses video, you might want to avoid this update, as some previous QuickTime updates have broken compatability with QuickTime for Java. On Mac OS X, Apple has provided a QuickTime 6.5.2 <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652reinstallerformac.html">reinstaller</a> that you can use to return to your previous configuration.
<br> <br>
Windows
<UL>
<LI>You must make sure that "QuickTime for Java" is installed. To
install it, you need to download it from <a
href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">apple.com/quicktime/download</A>. If you install the version "with iTunes", there's a second
  step. After the installation, go to Start Menu &rarr; QuickTime &rarr;
  QuickTime Updater. When it runs, use the "Custom" install, scroll
  down, and click the checkbox next to "QuickTime for Java" and then
  install. If you install the version of QuickTime without iTunes,
  you'll also need to use the "Custom" install, as outlined above. You
  will also need to follow this process if you have already installed
  QuickTime, and did not use the "Custom" or "Full" install.

<LI>In order for camera input to work, you'll need to install a
QuickTime-compatible video digitizer (VDIG). Unfortunately, most
cameras on Windows don't support QuickTime right off the bat, but
we've had reasonable luck with <a
href="http://www.vdig.com/WinVDIG/">WinVDIG</A>.

        <LI>If you're still having trouble, sometimes a full uninstall/reinstall 
          of Quicktime will do the trick. 
        <LI>If you're having trouble with video examples crashing
  processing or locking up your system, you should try placing the
  processing folder into the root level of your C:\ drive, or at least
  inside a set of folders that have no spaces in the name. We haven't
  determined if this is a QuickTime for Java or Processing bug yet,
  but it's been a problem for lots of people.

<LI>Video sometimes likes to crash the application completely on
  Windows. This seems to be due to problems with QuickTime for Java
  (since we shouldn't be able to write code that crashes using
  Java.. heh right), so these situations are probably outside of our
  control.
</UL>

Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>On Mac OS X 10.2 (jaguar, or jagwyre if you like black turtlenecks),
QuickTime for Java was missing from the initial release of QuickTime
6.4 on the mac. An upgrade to QuickTime 6.4 that includes qtjava is
available from software update. Better yet, ou can also upgrade to Mac
OS X 10.3 (panther) which doesn't have this problem.
<LI>If you get the following error:
<tt>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
  com/apple/mrj/macos/carbon/CarbonLock</tt>
then it means you need to update and/or reinstall QuickTime. There
  was some monkey business about QuickTime for Java updates being out
of sync with the Apple's Java updates, and this is one of the leftovers
of that scenario. Blame Apple. Blame Canada.

Using the Serial Port
</b> <br> <br>
All Platforms
<UL>
<LI>If you're using a program to check to see if the serial port is working, then it won't be available to Processing. That means that if you're using HyperTerminal or whatever to see if your serial device is working, then you need to quit out of that application before using that port with Processing.
<LI>Serial.list() will only list the ports that are currently available. So if you have a program that's using the serial port that you want to use for your Processing sketch, it's not going to be available, or even listed.
</UL>
Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>
We use <a href="http://rxtx.org">rxtx</A> (version 2.1_6) to handle
serial I/O, which is included with the Processing release. If this is
the first time you're using rxtx, you'll need to make your way to the
"libraries" folder, find "serial", and inside, and run
macosx_setup.command (double-click it and follow the instructions).
This will make sure that things are properly set up (a few permissions
need to be changed). 
<LI>If you're getting a "serial port is already in
use by another application" it's possible that you haven't run this
script. On my machine, I installed the keyspan driver for my
usb-serial converter, ran the script, and then rebooted in order for
things to work (a reboot does the body good). In the past, i've used a
keyspan 28X dual port adapter, and Serial.list() returns things like
<tt>/dev/cu.USA28X21P1.1</tt>. You'll probably have something
similar. Don't mind the frightening names.
<LI>Tom Igoe was kind enough to note that you'll be in a world of hurt
if you disconnect your serial adapter while a sketch is
running&mdash;it'll prolly freeze the machine and require a forced
reboot. This scenario may seem unlikely,(while this may seem nutty, you might run into it if
your adapter is plugged into your usb keyboard, and you have the
keyboard plugged into a monitor/keyboard switcher).
</UL>
Linux
<UL>
<LI>Linux also uses rxtx-2.1_6 (just like Mac OS X). If you're 
having trouble getting things to run, i.e. the port menu stays grayed 
out or you get error message spew to the console when starting the 
application saying "Permission denied" and "No permission to create 
lock file", this is because you probably need 
to add yourself to both the uucp or lock groups so that processing 
can write to /var/lock so it doesn't get in a fight with other 
applications talking on the serial port. 
<LI>Alan Kilian contributes this description:
<OL>
<LI> I did an ls -l /dev/ttyS0 and saw that the group was set to uucp.
<LI> Then I edited /etc/groups, I found the uucp group, and I added my 
   login ID to the uucp line.
<LI> I logged out, and logged back in again.
<LI> The "groups" command now showed I was in group uucp, and when I 
   started processing, the serial port menu item was not greyed-out.
</OL>
It's important that you're in both groups, and that you completely
log out and log back in again.
<LI>Running processing as root will often get rid of the errors, but
that's obviously not a good solution for a million reasons (among 
them: beta code that runs as root and handles files? yeah great...)

OpenGL Issues
</b> <br> <br>
<UL>
<LI>We don't recommend running other OpenGL programs while running
  Processing in OpenGL mode. GL tends takes charge of things so
  results will be unexpected (windows from the other app showing
  through to the Processing window, etc.)

<LI>Objects with alpha (lines or shapes with an alpha fill or stroke, images with alpha, all fonts) are displayed in OpenGL based on their drawing order. This creates some annoying effects like making things opaque if they're drawn out of order with objects above or beneath them. This is simply how OpenGL works, but is something that we'd like to develop a workaround for in the future. Currently, you should just try to draw things back-to-front as best as possible.

<LI>OpenGL sketches cannot be exported to run in a browser. The export won't
give an error, but they won't run properly. It's not clear whether this
is something that we can fix for the future.

<LI>OpenGL requires Java 1.4 or later. 

<LI>If you're getting this error on Windows: 
<tt>"net.java.games.jogl.GLException: Unable to enumerate pixel formats 
  of window using wglGetPixelFormatAttribivARB: 0"</tt>
and your machine has built in "Intel" graphics (this is the case for 
  many dell machines, for instance) you may just need an updated version 
  of your driver, which can be found 
<a href="http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df/Detail_Desc.asp?sType=prev&agr=N&ProductID=865&DwnldID=7919">here</a>. 
Of course, read the page closely and make sure that you in fact have
this graphics chipset on your machine before installing. <em>Thanks to
Daniel Shiffman for finding this fix!</em>

<LI>On Mac OS X, I don't think there's much we can do about the
  following error: <tt>Error: view not ready, cannot lock focus at 
  "/Users/kbr/JavaNet/jogl/src/native/jogl/
   MacOSXWindowSystemInterface.m:createContext:51"</tt>
  that shows up sometimes on Run. Just hit Run again and things oughta
  work. This may be our bug, but who knows.

<LI> On Windows, if you're getting a lot of OpenGL crashing, blue
screens, or other mess, your driver might be bad. For instance, if
you're using a Dell, use the driver they provide (<a
href="http://support.dell.com">support.dell.com</a>) instead of what
might be a more recent driver obtained directly from nvidia.com.

<LI>To get access to the GL object, you can use the following:
<PRE>GL gl = ((PGraphicsGL)g).gl;</PRE>
This will give you the <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/">jogl</a> 
object that talks directly to OpenGL and will let you make OpenGL 
calls directly. Note, however, that <em>this is not supported</em>, 
in the sense that if you get weird problems with a GL-based sketch
that uses this method, you're on your own. Processing is not intended
as a nice wrapper on top of OpenGL. Instead, we're using 
OpenGL graphics for one implementation of the Processing Core API. 

<LI>OpenGL lines aren't fully implemented, and strokeWeight() doesn't 
work properly.

Things that we probably can't fix
</b> <br> <br> 
Some things are out of our control, or not actually bugs...
<UL>

<LI>A long sketch menu that goes off the edge of the screen? Doesn't
  scroll properly? There's not much we can do. This is a java issue which
  happens on most platforms. To get around it, you can organize your
  sketches into subfolders which will appear as submenus (be sure to
  quit before reorganizing, and then restart when finished). 

<LI>If you're seeing a <TT>sun.dc.pr.PRException</TT>, it's because you're trying to draw something that's waaaaay off screen (like an x coordinate of -100,000 or something nutty like that).
<LI>On Windows, the system clock seems to go weird, especially when
  using framerate() or delay(). this is a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4500388">long-standing bug</a> with the
  window version of the Java VM.
  According to someone on the sun site: This bug has been fixed in 
  bug no 4500388 and one requires a PRODUCT FLAG to use the fix.
  This flag and fix are available in 1.3.1_4, 1.4.0_2, 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.
  But for Java to actually use the fix: <br>
  Open your Java Plug-in Control Panel in the section 'Java Runtime 
  Parameters' just enter: -XX:+ForceTimeHighResolution

<LI>On Windows, an error starting with <tt>"hs_err_pid10XX.txt"</tt> 
sometimes shows up. This is something within the Sun's Java VM that
we can't fix. It's not clear what the problem is, but it seems to have
shown up with java 1.4.

<LI>On Linux, the following message (or messages like it) on startup: <tt>
Warning: Cannot convert string
"-b&h-lucida-medium-r-normal-sans-*-140-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1" to type
FontStruct</tt>. This is just a Java issue, but doesn't seem to 
really affect things.

<LI>Create Font sometimes crashes on Windows, bringing down the whole
  environment. This seems to be a Java bug, because it's not a Java
  exception, but a full crash.

Known Bugs
      </b><br><br>
<em>This section is incomplete, but will contain links to the bug
      database's Greatest Hits collection.</em>
<br> <br>
Some highlights to get started:
<UL>
<LI>Java 1.1 support has been (temporarily) removed from this
release. We hope to bring it back, but it will take some time and we
didn't want to hold up beta any longer.
<LI>The stop button often doesn't stop things (like when using
libraries). Closing the window to shut things down usually works fine, 
though even that might lock up sometimes. Make sure you save your 
sketches before you run, in case you have to force-quit.
<LI>The set() functions are fairly broken when using OpenGL.
<LI>The size of exported applets is larger than we would like, but
we'll get things smaller and more optimize again. Having separated the
2D and 3D libraries, eventually we won't have to include the 3D code
when using 2D. 
<LI>println() is can be super slow and often locks things up
<LI>Dragging the applet window around will often make Processing lock up
<LI>2D graphics might be a bit flickery sometimes, try setting the
framerate() to get things under control
<LI>strokeWeight() doesn't work with P3D or OPENGL
<LI>The placement of applets that are 100x100 is sometimes weird
<LI>Sometimes things lock up when there are errors in code,
for instance, when using libraries like OpenGL, video, or net.
<LI>Errors are sometimes cryptic or don't even come through,
particularly on the Mac. 
<LI>int() and float() don't always work
<LI>pause() and framerate() aren't working with the video library
<LI>The beloved(?) "History" function from previous versions is
missing. In the meantime, "Archive Sketch" might be useful. 
<LI>Need to complete the "Tools" menu, which will be a way for people
to develop their own editor plug-ins.
<LI>"Export to Application" is not yet complete
<LI>When you have too many tabs, things get ugly
<LI>Save changes before quitting needs a "Cancel" button
<LI>Error messages are often too long or too weird
<LI>tint() is not affected textures but will in the future
<LI>updatePixels() seems to stink on the Mac. It can sometimes cause the 
screen to not update properly, or for video to contain weird bands of
mixed frames.
<LI>Lots of little UI things like proper focus or key shortcuts
