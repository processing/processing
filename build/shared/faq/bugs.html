I've found a bug! 
      </b><br><br>
<em>I know you're excited, but please avoid the urge to just email
      us!</em> especially sending mail to Ben or Casey directly. This
      includes sending us "Instant Messages" on the discourse section
      of the site. While you may prefer the privacy of a personal
      message, it's much quicker for
      you to write to the board, where you'll find all sorts of
      helpful people who are also often at all hours of the night. If you
      email us directly, we'll either not respond or just ask you to
      use the discourse board anyway.
<br> <br>
<em>We spend a lot of
      our time helping people with Processing, so reading and
      following these instructions means that you respect our time and
      don't want to waste it.</em>
<br> <br>
First, read the FAQ. Start with digging through this page and maybe
      the <A HREF="platforms.html">platforms</A> page too in case it's
      something specific to your operating system. 
<br> <br>
Second, search the <a href="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">bug
database</a> to see if your problem has already been reported. 
Most often, this will contain background on the bug, a workaround, 
or hopefully a bit about its status. The bug database is unfortunately
      incomplete so it doesn't cover everything, but it will get
      better with time.
<br> <br>
If you don't find your bug, enter it as a new bug in
the database, which we use to keep track of things. If you're having
      trouble or find it confusing (or the word "database" gives you
      the willies), please post on the
      discourse board so that we can get you straightened out.
<br> <br>
When reporting please include information about
<OL>
<LI> the revision number (i.e. 0085)
<LI> what operating system you're using, and on what kind of hardware
<LI> a copy of the smallest possible piece of code that will
   produce the error you're having trouble with
<LI> details of the error, either the red spew that you see in the
console, or the last few lines from the files stdout.txt or stderr.txt 
from the 'lib' folder. 
</OL>
For stranger errors during compile time, you can also look inside the
build folder which contains an intermediate (translated into
java) version of your code. The build folder is in the same location
as preferences.txt: <br>
<UL>
<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; build
<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; 
Processing &rarr; build
<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; build
</UL>
The more details you can post, the better, because it helps us figure
out what's going on. Useful things when reporting:
<UL>
<LI> We want the minimum amount of code that will still replicate the
  bug. The worst that can happen is we get a report with a subject
  saying "problem!" along with a three page program. 
  Sure, everyone likes a puzzle, but simpler code will receive a 
  faster response. 
<LI> Occasionally we may need you to pack up a copy of your sketch folder 
  or something similar so that we can try and replicate the weirdness 
  on our own machine. Rest assured, we have no interest in messing with
  your fancy creations or stealing your ideas. The Processing team is
  a pair of straight-laced boys who hail from the midwestern U.S. who 
  were brought up better than that. and as we often lack enough time to
  build our own projects, we have even less time to spend figuring out
  other peoples' projects to rip them off.

      Processing won't start! Nothing happens when I click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;!
</b> <br> <br>
Windows
<UL>
<LI>If you're using the "without Java" download, try downloading the version that includes Java. Chances are, your machine has Java 1.5 installed, which is <A HREF="platforms#java">not supported</A> and causes lots of headaches. For instance, it won't play nice with some graphics cards and causes the Processing window to come up mostly blank.
<LI> Processing seems to have trouble starting when run from a user 
account that contains non-ascii characters. For instance, if your name 
contains Japanese characters or umlauts, it's likely to have trouble. 
Sometimes using run.bat instead will fix this. Another fix is to
create a user account that uses only ascii characters. In the meantime, 
we're looking for a fix. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49">Bug 49</A>)
<!-- <LI> In general, Processing probably won't work if you install it inside
  a folder with non-ascii characters in its name. For instance, if the
  name of your user folder includes Japanese characters, 
or it has an umlaut or cedilla or anything else fancy, you're gonna
  have trouble. The same sometimes happens when Processing is on the 
desktop, or somewhere inside that folder. The fix
  to place processing inside the root level of your C:\ drive (or
  whatever drive you use) and it'll be ok again. This will be fixed in
  the future.
-->
<LI>If you have lots of garbage in your CLASSPATH environment
  variable, that might cause trouble starting up a sketch. You might
  get "Couldn't find package xxx.xxx" errors. Clean things up by avoiding
  spaces and quotes. This is because of Windows' awesome
  hokiness and its not-as-distant-as-it-should-be ancestor DOS. In the
  future, we'd like to detect errors like this before they cause
  trouble. That issue is being tracked at <A
  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=112">Bug 112</A>.
<LI>You might also try using run.bat to start processing. Lots
  of people seem to have a better time with this method.
<LI>Some graphics cards have conflicts with Java applications and
therefore Processing, which can cause the application to hang or
freeze. Under one scenario, disabling anti-aliasing on the card will
get rid of these problems (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=232">Bug 232</A>).
<LI>If you're still having trouble, try disabling any overly
  protective virus scanning software. It might be holding things up,
  especially when libraries have been imported.
</UL>
Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>If you're running on Mac OS X 10.2, read the <a href="platforms.html#mac">platforms</a> section regarding things that may be broken.
<LI>Sometimes you might see the following error: <br>
<TT>dyld: /Applications/processing/jikes version mismatch for library:<br>/sw/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version of user: <br>
5.0.0 greater than library's version: 3.0.0)</TT> <br>
It seems that this happens when an older version of <a
  href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</A> is installed. In this
  case, you should either update or uninstall Fink. (thanks to ryan govostes for tracking this down)
</UL>
Linux
<UL>
<LI>If you get an error reading <TT>jikes: error while loading 
shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: 
No such file or directory</TT>,
It's because Processing requires libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 for jikes. 
You should either install it or, since it's old, install the rpm/package 
for compat-libstdc++ before Processing will run. Or find/rebuild a different 
version of jikes that's compatible with your distro. Jikes is available 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128803">here</a>, and it's an easy ./configure, make, and then copy src/jikes to the 
processing-XXXX folder and you should be all set. (<A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=47">Bug 47</A>)
<br> <br>
<LI>Or if you encounter a problem like this one: <TT>jikes: relocation
error: /opt/processing-0087/./jikes: undefined symbol:
__dynamic_cast_2</TT>, then that also means that jikes is incompatible
with your distro. (Also <A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=47">Bug 47</A>)
</UL>
Any Platform
<UL>
<LI> 
Errors inside code that is outside of setup() or draw() may just
hang/freeze Processing. For instance, with this code, if "blah.vlw" is
not in the "data" folder, it may just hang:
<PRE>  PFont font = loadFont("blah.vlw");

  void setup {
    // your awesome code
  }</PRE>
In general, a better practice is to use loadFont() (and
loadImage and the rest) inside of a function like setup().

Export and Browser Troubles
</b> <br> <br>
Sketches (applets) often have trouble once exported that will cause
errors in a browser. <br> <br>
To figure out what your problem is, you should first check the Java
(not JavaScript!) console. On Windows, right-click the coffee cup at
the right of the task bar, and select "Open Console". On Mac OS X, go
to Applications &rarr; Utilities &rarr; Console and see what the last
few error messages were.
<BR> <BR>
The most common cause is a security issue. Java applets aren't allowed
to do things like the following:
<UL>
<LI>Applets cannot open or write to files on the local machine. So
things like saveFrame() will cause an error when run from an
applet. To read files, make sure that you use "Add File..." to add the
file to your sketch (or place it in the data folder yourself) so that
it will be included when exported. Then, only use functions like
loadStrings(), loadImage(), openStream(), etc. to read data from your file.
<LI>Applets may only connect to servers other than the one from which
they came. If you need to redirect things from another server, you can
write a short script that will do it, understanding the possible
security consequences for your own machine.
<LI>They're also not allowed to do things like capture video or
audio. You don't want a malicious applet that turns on your webcam and
starts sending things back to their server.
</UL>
Other common problems:
<UL>
<LI>Another common problem is placing images or files into the sketch
folder by hand, rather than placing them in the data folder (or using
"Add File..." to do so automatically). This will work from the
PDE, but on export, the files won't be in included with your sketch
because they're not in the data folder.
<LI>Watch out for issues with capitalization! Windows and Mac OS don't
care about capitalization, so "blah.JPG" looks just the same as
"blah.jpg". However, since most servers run on Unix, capitalization
becomes a huge problem, because it must be exact. We've added some
checks to try and catch this (at least for images) but they're not
perfect. This can especially be a problem when the .JPG extension is
not even visible (the default on Windows), so you don't know whether
it's upper or lower case.
<LI>Your browser may be using an old version of an
applet. Unfortunately it's often difficult to get your browser to
flush its cache. You
may need to quit all instances of the browser, use alt-reload (or ctrl
or shift or option, who knows) to get the new version to show
up. On Windows, clicking the Java coffee cup at the right of the task
bar can bring up a control panel that will let you flush the Java
cache too. This is different across all platforms, but if someone
wants to write a good explanation for any platform they're familiar
with, please post on the <A
HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/">discourse</A> area of the site
and we'll add it to the FAQ.
</UL>
Some libraries simply don't work with the web (at least not for now):
<UL>
<LI>You cannot use the OpenGL library from the web. (<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=166">Bug 166</A>)
<LI>The video library (both Capture and Movie) cannot be used on the
web

Issues with "Export to Application"
</b> <br> <br>
The "Export to Application" is implemented as of release 0097 but has
not been heavily tested. If you find problems, 
<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">file a bug</A>.
<UL>
<LI>Just like when exporting as an applet, the "application.xxxx"
folders will be removed completely on export.
<LI>It is important that you don't have a method named main() in your
sketch, unless you know what you're doing (writing your own
main). Otherwise this will fool the preprocessor into thinking you
have a clue, when in fact you don't.
<LI>If running in "Java" mode, where your code starts "public class
blah extends PApplet", you'll need to write your own main() method in
order for Export to Application to work. It should look something like this:
<PRE>
static public void main(String args[]) {
  PApplet.main(new String[] { "YourClassName" });
}
</PRE>
Not doing this, or using your own main can cause problems internally
with variables not being properly set up. If you opt not to use
PApplet.main(), make sure you read the source code for it so that you
understand how it works, and don't whine if it breaks.
<LI>To make an exported application run in "present" mode, you'll have 
to write your own main(). It needs to look something like this:
<PRE>
static public void main(String args[]) {
  PApplet.main(new String[] { "--display", "YourClassName" });
}
</PRE>
Other advanced options can be read in the 
<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/reference/core/javadoc/processing/core/PApplet.html#main(java.lang.String[])">developer's reference</A> for main(). In a future release, this will be part of an export options dialog.
<LI>The "Movie" and "Capture" examples do not yet work properly, this
will be fixed shortly. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=230">Bug 230</A>)
<LI>Exporting sketches that use the video library may be broken, it's
not clear the extent of this issue (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=231">Bug
231</A>), but it will be repaired for a future release. 
<LI>Export to Application will create sketches for Windows, Mac OS X,
and Linux. Someday we might implement a dialog box that lets you
select which one you actually want, but for now, enjoy the bounty.
<LI>When exporting for Mac OS X from Windows, be sure to read through
the readme.txt file in the application.macosx folder&mdash;your
application likely won't work on Mac OS X without a minor
modification.
<LI>The Mac OS X export is a nice .app bundle like a regular OS X
application. You can change the icon or edit its settings by using
"Show Package Contents" and editing Info.plist or replacing
sketch.icns with something more exciting.
<LI>Windows is a shell .exe that calls the code and requires the "lib"
folder along with it be kept intact. Someday we might make Windows be
a nice single .exe file, but this requires more time to implement, and
more specifically, make work consistently with the libraries. If
you're finicky about this, use a Java EXE generator such as <A
HREF="http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/">JSmooth</A> or <A
HREF="http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/">launch4j</A>.
<LI>To set the icon used on the title bar for Windows, use the
following code: (submitted by dxtx)
<PRE>
ImageIcon titlebaricon = new ImageIcon(loadBytes("myicon.gif"));
frame.setIconImage(titlebaricon.getImage());
</PRE>
Note that within the PDE, the icon will only show up when a code 
folder is in use or a library has been imported. However, it should
show up on all occasions when exported to an application.
<LI>Linux is just a shell script, which can probably be used on most
Unix platforms (there's almost nothing to it). 
<LI>When distributing your application, the "source" folder can be
removed from the export if you'd like, but other files (such as the
lib folder and any .dll files or whatever) should be left intact
otherwise the application may not work properly.
<LI>If you just want an executable jar file, export as an
applet. Executable jar files will most likely not work with
libraries because the path information will not be properly set, and
the additional library jars won't be referenced. 
<LI>Library writers can now specify what files to export for each
platform, see the updated libraries/howto.txt for more information.
<LI>Your current memory settings will be exported with the
application. If you've set outrageous memory requirements, you might
want to undo that before exporting for others, or edit the exported
files by hand (Contents/Resources/Info.plist on Mac OS X and
lib/args.txt on Windows).
<LI>If you want to replace (or add) titlebar text, just do this in
setup():
<PRE>
frame.setTitle("This is in the titlebar!"); </PRE>
(thanks dxtx for pointing this out)
<LI>Holding down shift while clicking "Export" on the toolbar will
export to application instead of an applet.
<LI>Users must still have Java installed to use your exported
application. You can also copy the "java" folder from Processing to
the same folder as your app so that users needn't install their own
Java (this is the same as the "standard" version of processing), or
you want to ensure that a certain version of the VM is used. For the
time being, the error message when Java is installed may be
nonexistant or cryptic. 
<LI>Someday we'll also add features like icon files and whatnot. Or at
least a default icon for the exported stuff. Or maybe even a splash
screen while the VM is loading. Again, if you want more control, use
your own application generator (see above for Windows, or use the Java
package maker whatchamacallit on Mac OS X).

      <b>
Out Of Memory Errors
</b> <br> <br>
There are two types of programs in Processing. Some are run from
inside the environment, but whenever you import a library, include a
code folder, or use "Present" to view your sketch, it will be run
as a separate Java program, which we sometimes call running "externally".
<br> <br>
To increase the amount of memory available to those programs, open
your preferences.txt file and edit the run.options line to include
something like:
<PRE>-Xms128m -Xmx1024m</PRE>
This will increase the amount of RAM to 128 megabytes of stack, and
1024 megabytes of heap (the latter being effectively usable RAM).
This will eventually be a setting that's added to the preferences
window (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=233">Bug 233</A>).
<br> <br>
Depending on your OS and available RAM, there are limits on how much
memory you can ask for. On Windows with 1G of RAM, it seems to be in
the neighborhood of 1.5 GB. Mac OS X seems to be somewhat similar, but
you mileage will vary with different versions of Java (1.3, 1.4,
1.5). Unfortunately this does place an upper bound on things that is
outside our control. You might look into the contributed Illustrator
or SVG vector export libraries that can be found on the libraries page
as another alternative for creating large format images.
<br> <br>
The preferences.txt file is stored in different locations on each
platform:
<UL>
<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; 
Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; preferences.txt
</UL>
To increase the amount of memory for Processing itself and for
sketches that are not running externally: 
<UL>
<LI>On Windows, try adjusting the parameters in the file 'run.bat' and
use that to run instead of Processing.exe. Short instructions can be
found inside that file. It appears that the maximum amount of RAM that
can be used on Windows is around 1.4 GB.
<br> <br>
<LI>On Mac OS X, right-click on Processing, select Show Package
Contents, then edit "Info.plist" inside "Contents". Change these
lines:
<PRE>&lt;key&gt;VMOptions&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;-Xms128M -Xmx256M&lt;/string&gt;</PRE>
to set to something higher than 128M and 256M (128 and 256 megabytes
of ram) as you need to (and at your own risk).
<br> <br>
<LI>On Linux, adjust the Processing shell script as needed.

Why don't these Strings equal? 
</b> <br> <br>
Comparing a string (quoted text) is different in Processing (Java) than it is in
ActionScript, which often confuses people. For instance, while this
might make sense:
<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  if (lines[i] == "hello") { 
    println("hello found on line: " + i); // you'll never see this
  }
}</PRE>
You'll never see the message, even if "hello" is in the list. 
This is because a String is an <em>object</em>
in Java, comparing them with == will only compare whether the two
things are pointing at the same memory, not their actual
contents. Instead, use equals() or one of the other String methods:
<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  if (<B>lines[i].equals("hello")</B>) {
    println("hello found on line: " + i); // happiness
  }

Why does 2 / 5 = 0 instead of 0.4?
</b> <br> <br>
The result of dividing two integers will always be another integer:
<PRE>int a = 2;
int b = 5;
int result = a / b;
// result is zero</PRE>
While somewhat confusing at first, this is later useful for more
advanced programming. <BR> <BR>
To get fractions, use a 'float' instead: 
<PRE>float a = 2.0;
float b = 5.0;
float result = a / b;
// result is 0.4</PRE>
It is not enough to just divide two integers and set them to a float:
<PRE>float y = 2 / 5;</PRE>
In this case, integer 2 is divided by 5, which is zero, and then zero
is assigned to a float. The number doesn't become a float until the
lefthand side of the = sign. On the other hand, this:
<PRE>float y = 2.0 / 5;</PRE>
will work just fine. In this case, Java sees that 2.0 is a float, so
it also converts the 5 to a float so that they can be divided, which
makes it identical to:
<PRE>float y = 2.0 / 5.0;</PRE>
and because floats are being used on the righthand side, the result
will be a float, even before it gets to the lefthand side.

Common Issues (not bugs)
</b> <br> <br>
Things that are often perceived as bugs, but aren't actually 'broken'.

<UL>
<LI>If your code has methods (it's not just in static mode) or needs
to run over time, it must have a draw() method, otherwise nothing will
happen. 
<LI>Objects with alpha (lines or shapes with an alpha fill or stroke,
images with alpha, all fonts) are displayed in P3D and OpenGL based on
their drawing order. This creates some annoying effects like making
things opaque if they're drawn out of order with objects above or
beneath them. This is simply how most 3D rendering works, but is
something that we'd like to develop a workaround for in the
future. Currently, you should just try to draw things back-to-front as
best as possible. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=176">Bug 176</A>)

<LI> Names of sketches cannot start with a number, or have spaces
  inside. This is mostly because of a restriction on the naming of
  java classes. I suppose if lots of people find this upsetting, we
  could add some extra code to unhinge the resulting class name from
  the sketch name, but it adds complexity, and complexity == bugs. :)

<LI>Mind the capitalization of built-in functions. If a method or variable 
name is two words, usually the first word is lowercase and the first letter
of the second word will be capitalized. For instance: keyPressed, movieEvent, mouseX, etc. If you have a function called mousepressed(), it won't be called when mouse events occur, because it needs the capital P on 'pressed'.

<LI> If you get a "ClassCastException" when trying to run your code 
  in a browser, you're probably trying to run non-Java 1.1 compliant 
  code. This means any classes that didn't exist in java 1.1. Or, 
  if if you're exporting as applet, variables that are 'final int' 
  need to be 'static final int', otherwise they'll have trouble on 
  a maching that only has Java 1.1 installed (i.e. running Microsoft's 
  Java on Windows). You should also avoid using "final" variables 
  <em>inside</em> of methods, since those aren't supported by 
  Microsoft's VM (and that's the one most widely installed).

<LI>On Mac OS X, the error message: 
<tt>## Component Manager: attempting to find symbols in a component
  alias of type (regR/carP/x!bt)</tt> 
is not something from processing, it is a bug in Roxio Toast 5.2's Video
  CD Support extension. To suppress the messages, move "Toast Video CD
  Support.qtx" out of /Library/QuickTime (at least until you need to
  do Video CD work).

<LI>On Windows, sometimes your programs will run in a window that has a 
  Java coffee cup icon, instead of the usual Processing icon. This 
  simply means that the application is being run outside of Processing
  as an external application. This happens when extra libraries, 
  multiple source code files (more than one tab), or extra code files
  in the 'code' folder are employed.

<LI>mouseX and mouseY always even (or always odd) numbers? By default,
Windows 2000 (and XP?) seems to skip every other pixel on the screen,
causing weirdness for some drawing applications done with Processing.
If you're seeing this, you can fix it by visiting Control Panels
&rarr; Mouse &rarr; Pointer Options &rarr; Enhance pointer precision.
(This was actually tracked down by someone else in the community,
whose name I have misplaced. if it was you, please drop me a line so
you can be properly cited. This kind of help is huge for us, since
we're such a small group!)

Problems with Video (Quicktime for Java)
</b> <br> <br>
Getting video to work can be kind of a cluster, particularly on
Windows. We use QuickTime for Java, which is sometimes difficult to
install or can be flakey. Someday in the future perhaps we can
circumvent this mess.
<br> <br>
The QuickTime 7 upgrade released April 29, 2005 (and now included with
iTunes 6) introduces its own unique set of problems. See below for
more caveats and fun that are specific to your platform.
<br> <br>
The message "This version of QuickTime for Java has expired" is an Apple bug,
and is fixed in the version of QuickTime that is included with iTunes
6.0.1 (or later), or, as of 20 October 2005, is available separate
from iTunes <A
HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone.html">here</A>.
<br> <br>
You can find more discussion about video and problems that people have
had over in the <A
HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=VideoCamera">Video
& Movies</A> section of the discourse board. And if you find a bug,
please use the <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">bugs database</A>.
<br> <br>
Windows
<UL>
<LI>In order for camera input to work, you'll need to install a
QuickTime-compatible video digitizer (VDIG). Unfortunately, most
cameras on Windows don't support QuickTime right off the bat, but
we've had reasonable luck with <a
href="http://www.vdig.com/WinVDIG/">WinVDIG</A>. 
<A HREF="http://www.vdig.com/WinVDIG/WinVDIG_101.exe">WinVDIG
1.0.1</A> is for QuickTime 6, and <A
HREF="http://www.vdig.com/WinVDIG/WinVDIG_105.exe">WinVDIG 1.0.5</A>
(or any later release on the site) is for QuickTime 7. Use the capture
application included with the WinVDIG install to make sure that things
are working properly (this helps us isolate WinVDIG vs. QuickTime for
Java vs. Processing bugs).
<LI>If you want to avoid QuickTime 7, use the <A
HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652forwindows.html">QuickTime
6.5.2</A> installer that's buried on Apple's site. Uninstall QuickTime
7 before installing 6.5 (see below). You will also have to use a
version of iTunes that's compatible with QuickTime 6 (anything earlier
than iTunes 6).
<LI>If you're installing QuickTime 6.5, you must make sure that
"QuickTime for Java" is included. During the
installation, use the "Custom" install, scroll down, and make sure the
checkbox next to "QuickTime for Java" is marked. You will also need to
follow this process if you have already installed QuickTime 6, and did
not use the "Custom" or "Full" install. To remedy this, use the
QuickTime Updater from the QuickTime folder that's added to the Start
menu.
<LI>For QuickTime 7 (iTunes 6 and later), you'll need to use release
0093 (or later) of Processing. QuickTime 7 causes 0092 and earlier to
break because Apple decided to move the location of several installed
files.
<LI>Better yet, you should use release 0102 (or later) of
Processing, which also fixes a number of QuickTime-related issues.
<LI>If you're still having trouble, sometimes a full uninstall/reinstall 
of Quicktime will do the trick. This may take a good bit of
work. First try using Add/Remove Programs to uninstall. At some point
you might get an "Error 1714" saying that "The older version of
QuickTime cannot be removed." The solution from Apple is to delete
C:\WINDOWS\TEMP, and then clean remnants of QuickTime from the
registry as outlined in <A
HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;290301">this</A>
Microsoft Support document. More discussion of installer-related
issues can be seen at <A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=171">Bug 171</A>.

<!--
        <LI>If you're having trouble with video examples crashing
  processing or locking up your system, you should try placing the
  processing folder into the root level of your C:\ drive, or at least
  inside a set of folders that have no spaces in the name. We haven't
  determined if this is a QuickTime for Java or Processing bug yet,
  but it's been a problem for lots of people.
-->

<LI>Video sometimes likes to crash the application completely on
  Windows. This seems to be due to problems with QuickTime for Java
  (since we shouldn't be able to write code that crashes using
  Java.. heh right), so these situations are probably outside of our
  control.
</UL>

Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>If you're having problems since the QuickTime 7 update, one option
is to reinstall QuickTime 6. Apple has provided a QuickTime 6.5.2
reinstallers for <a
href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652reinstallerforquicktime701.html">QuickTime 7.0.1</a> and <a
href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime652reinstallerforquicktime70.html">QuickTime
7.0</A> that you can use to return to your previous configuration. If
you're using QuickTime 7.0.3 or 7.0.4, you'll have to first downgrade
to 7.0.1, using the QuickTime 7.0.1 reinstaller for <A
HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime701reinstallerforquicktime703.html">QuickTime
7.0.3</A> or <A
HREF="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/quicktime701reinstallerforquicktime704.html">QuickTime 7.0.4</A>.
<LI>On Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar, or Jagwyre if you like black turtlenecks),
QuickTime for Java was missing from the initial release of QuickTime
6.4. An upgrade to QuickTime 6.4 that includes QuickTime for Java is
available from software update. We don't recommend using 10.2 (we
don't have time to support it), so if you can move to Panther or
later, it's highly recommended.
<LI>If you get the following error:
<tt>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
  com/apple/mrj/macos/carbon/CarbonLock</tt>
then it means you need to update and/or reinstall QuickTime. There
  was some monkey business about QuickTime for Java updates being out
of sync with the Apple's Java updates, and this is one of the leftovers
of that scenario. Blame Apple. Blame Canada.
</UL>

Linux (or any other platform)
<UL>
<LI>The video library is only supported on Windows and Mac OS, because it relies on QuickTime for Java. There has been discussion of using other libraries (such as JMF) to bring support to Linux, search <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse">discourse</A> for more information.
</UL>

Windows and Mac OS
<UL>
<LI>Video performance is not particularly great. The library is simply not built (and Java is not currently capable) of moving around 640x480 video on most machines, much less doing analysis on the video. The library was intended as a way to get pixels and manipulate them (either small pixel buffers interactively, or large ones for non real-time use). There are better tools for real-time, large screen analysis. It is my estimate that a 2x performance increase can probably be obtained by making better use of the QuickTime for Java library, but this still won't be enough to do analysis of 640x480 pixels at 30 frames per second, so it remains a lower priority. As always <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/">contributions are welcome</A>, in case you're a video hacker who wants to help improve the library. (<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=40">Bug 40</A>)
<LI>Projects that use video cannot (currently?) be exported to the
web. (<A HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=44">Bug 44</A>)

Using the Serial Port
</b> <br> <br>
All Platforms
<UL>
<LI>If you're using a program to check to see if the serial port is working, then it won't be available to Processing. That means that if you're using HyperTerminal or whatever to see if your serial device is working, then you need to quit out of that application before using that port with Processing.
<LI>Serial.list() will only list the ports that are currently
available. So if you have a program that's using the serial port that
you want to use for your Processing sketch, it's not going to be
available, or even listed.
<LI>If you get an error reading something like this:<BR> <BR>
<TT>WARNING:  RXTX Version mismatch<BR>
Jar version = RXTX-2.0-4<BR>
native lib Version = RXTX-2.1-7pre17<BR>

<BR>
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library /Applications/processing-0090/libraries/serial/library/librxtxSerial.jnilib already loaded in another classloader</TT><BR><BR>
then you probably have another copy of RXTX installed somewhere. This
is a messy thing to straighten out, because it could be anywhere in
your PATH or CLASSPATH. Search your drive for RXTXcomm.jar or simply
comm.jar. Files that might cause trouble are libSerial.jnilib 
(on Mac OS X), libSerial.dll (Windows), jcl.jar, and
javax.comm.properties. (contributed by stendahl)
</UL>
Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>
We use <a href="http://rxtx.org">rxtx</A> (version 2.1_6) to handle
serial I/O, which is included with the Processing release. If this is
the first time you're using rxtx, you'll need to make your way to the
"libraries" folder, find "serial", and inside, and run
macosx_setup.command (double-click it and follow the instructions).
This will make sure that things are properly set up (a few permissions
need to be changed). 
<LI>If you're getting a "serial port is already in
use by another application" it's possible that you haven't run this
script. On my machine, I installed the keyspan driver for my
usb-serial converter, ran the script, and then rebooted in order for
things to work (a reboot does the body good). In the past, I've used a
keyspan 28X dual port adapter, and Serial.list() returns things like
<tt>/dev/cu.USA28X21P1.1</tt>. You'll probably have something
similar. Don't mind the frightening names.
<LI>Tom Igoe was kind enough to note that you'll be in a world of hurt
if you disconnect your serial adapter while a sketch is
running&mdash;it'll prolly freeze the machine and require a forced
reboot. This scenario may seem unlikely, but you might run into it if
your adapter is plugged into a USB keyboard, and you have the
keyboard plugged into a monitor/keyboard switcher.
<LI>The OS X 10.4 (Tiger) installer wipes out your permissions and groups
on /var/spool/uucp, so you'll have to run the setup command
again. However, running it returns:
<BR> <BR>
<TT>check_group_uucp(): error testing lock file    creation Error
details: Permission deniedcheck_lock_status: No permission to create
lock file. </TT> <BR> <BR>
Tom Igoe's extremely technical solution: &ldquo;After you have run the
macosx_setup.command, Shut down the machine and restart. <BR> <BR>
&ldquo;Don't logout then log back in.  Don't just restart.  Shut down and restart.  I don't care that you've got a record uptime you're trying to preserve. SHUT DOWN AND RESTART! Don't be an idiot like I was.  This will free up the old lock files, which apparently carry over from the previous systems, and your serial devices will be happy.
<BR> <BR> 
&ldquo;And on that note, Tiger and Processing are playing happily together with a serial port, like kittens with a ball of string.&rdquo;
</UL>
Linux
<UL>
<LI>Linux also uses rxtx-2.1_6 (just like Mac OS X). If you're 
having trouble getting things to run, i.e. the port menu stays grayed 
out or you get error message spew to the console when starting the 
application saying "Permission denied" and "No permission to create 
lock file", this is because you probably need 
to add yourself to both the uucp or lock groups so that processing 
can write to /var/lock so it doesn't get in a fight with other 
applications talking on the serial port. 
<LI>Alan Kilian contributes this description:
<OL>
<LI> I did an ls -l /dev/ttyS0 and saw that the group was set to uucp.
<LI> Then I edited /etc/groups, I found the uucp group, and I added my 
   login ID to the uucp line.
<LI> I logged out, and logged back in again.
<LI> The "groups" command now showed I was in group uucp, and when I 
   started processing, the serial port menu item was not greyed-out.
</OL>
It's important that you're in both groups, and that you completely
log out and log back in again.
<LI>Running processing as root will often get rid of the errors, but
that's obviously not a good solution for a million reasons (among 
them: beta code that runs as root and handles files? yeah great...)

When Drawing in 2D

<UL>
<LI>The default renderer as of beta uses Java 2D. It's more accurate
than the renderer used in alpha, but is super slow for handling
pixels. At least until we get a chance to get the old 2D renderer
working in a similar fashion, you can use size(w, h, P3D)
instead of size(w, h) which will be faster for general pixel flipping
madness.

This will let you do Java 2D stuff directly, but is not supported in
any way shape or form. Which just means "have fun, but don't complain

  through to the Processing window, etc.)

<LI>OpenGL is really memory hungry because of how tetxures work. In
OpenGL mode, your images as the next power of two larger in either
direction. This means an image that's 40x190 pixels will be stored as
a 64x256 pixel x 4 bytes per pixel array (along with the original
image storage being width x height x 4). This is probably something we
can optimize in the future, however no attempt will be made until the
surrounding code is debugged. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150">Bug 150</A>)

<LI>OpenGL sketches cannot be exported to run in a browser. The export
probably won't give an error, but they won't run properly. It's not
clear whether this is something that we can fix for the future.

<LI>OpenGL requires Java 1.4 or later. 

<LI>If you're getting a blank screen or strange graphics on Windows, 
try messing with your graphics card settings (or even with a different
graphics card). There are lots of options that can cause trouble (if
you run into such a situation, please post to the board on how you got
it fixed).

<LI>If you're getting this error on Windows: 
<tt>"net.java.games.jogl.GLException: Unable to enumerate pixel formats 
  of window using wglGetPixelFormatAttribivARB: 0"</tt>
and your machine has built in "Intel" graphics (this is the case for 
  many Dell machines, for instance) you may just need an updated version 
  of your driver, which can be found 
<a href="http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df/Detail_Desc.asp?sType=prev&agr=N&ProductID=865&DwnldID=7919">here</a>. 
Of course, read the page closely and make sure that you in fact have
this graphics chipset on your machine before installing. Thanks to
Daniel Shiffman for finding this fix.

<LI><STRIKE>On Mac OS X, I don't think there's much we can do about the
  following error: <tt>Error: view not ready, cannot lock focus at 
  "/Users/kbr/JavaNet/jogl/src/native/jogl/
   MacOSXWindowSystemInterface.m:createContext:51"</tt>
  that shows up sometimes on Run. Just hit Run again and things oughta
  work. This may be our bug, but who knows.</STRIKE> "Cannot lock
  focus" bug on OS X is fixed for Processing release 93, thanks to
  toxi for tracking it down as fixed with a new JOGL release.

<LI> On Windows, if you're getting a lot of OpenGL crashing, blue
screens, or other mess, your driver might be bad. For instance, if
you're using a Dell, use the driver they provide (<a
href="http://support.dell.com">support.dell.com</a>) instead of what
might be a more recent driver obtained directly from nvidia.com.

<LI>To get access to the GL object, you can use the following:
<PRE>GL gl = ((PGraphicsGL)g).gl;</PRE>
This will give you the <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/">jogl</a> 
object that talks directly to OpenGL and will let you make OpenGL 
calls directly. Note, however, that <em>this is not supported</em>, 
in the sense that if you get weird problems with a GL-based sketch
that uses this method, you're on your own. Processing is not intended
as a nice wrapper on top of OpenGL. Instead, we're using 
OpenGL graphics for one implementation of the Processing Core
API. <BR> 
Because most of the work in drawing is handled by Processing, most
OpenGL calls will not work, because the model and perspective matrices
won't be set up properly. Therefore, using the GL object will mostly
only be useful for tweaking obscure OpenGL parameters.

Things that we probably can't fix
</b> <br> <br> 
Some things are out of our control, or not actually bugs...
<br> <br>

All Platforms
<UL>
<LI>A long sketch menu that goes off the edge of the screen? Doesn't
  scroll properly? There's not much we can do. This is a java issue which
  happens on most platforms. To get around it, you can organize your
  sketches into subfolders which will appear as submenus (be sure to
  quit before reorganizing, and then restart when finished). 
<LI>If you're seeing a <TT>sun.dc.pr.PRException</TT>, it's because
  you're trying to draw something that's waaaaay off screen (like an x
  coordinate of -100,000 or something nutty like that). (<A
  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=104">Bug 104</A>)
</UL>

Windows
<UL>
<LI>The system clock sometimes goes weird, especially when
  using framerate() or delay(). This is a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4500388">long-standing bug</a> with the
  Windows version of the Java VM.
  According to someone on the sun site: This bug has been fixed in 
  bug no 4500388 and one requires a PRODUCT FLAG to use the fix.
  This flag and fix are available in 1.3.1_4, 1.4.0_2, 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.
  But for Java to actually use the fix: <br>
  Open your Java Plug-in Control Panel in the section 'Java Runtime 
  Parameters' just enter: -XX:+ForceTimeHighResolution
<LI>Create Font sometimes crashes on Windows, bringing down the whole
  environment. This seems to be a Java bug, because it's not a Java
  exception, but a full crash. (<A
  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=99">Bug 99</A>).
<LI>An error starting with <tt>"hs_err_pid10XX.txt"</tt> 
sometimes shows up. This is something within the Sun's Java VM that
we can't fix. It's not clear what the problem is, but it seems to have
shown up with java 1.4.
</UL>
Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>
An error that reads something like 
<TT>2005-05-19 14:20:44.209 java[875] _initWithWindowNumber: error
creating graphics ctxt object for ctxt:72059, window:26969</TT> is a
known bug in Apple's Java implementation. (<A
HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=53">Bug 53</A>)
<LI>
Sometimes something like the following will come up: <TT> ***
malloc[438]: Deallocation of a pointer not malloced: 0xffffffff; This
could be a double free(), or free() called with the middle of an
allocated block; Try setting environment variable MallocHelp to see
tools to help debug </TT> it seems to be a bug in Apple's OS X
Java. It doesn't appear to hurt anything but there also doesn't appear
to be anything we can do to fix it. (<A
HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=52">Bug 52</A>)
</UL>
Linux
<UL>
<LI>The following message (or messages like it) on startup: 
<tt>Warning: Cannot convert string
"-b&h-lucida-medium-r-normal-sans-*-140-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1" to type
FontStruct</tt>. This is just a Java issue, but doesn't seem to 
affect things.

<UL>
<LI>Java 1.1 support has been (temporarily) removed from this
release. We hope to bring it back, but it will take some time and we
didn't want to hold up beta any longer. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=125">Bug 125</A>)
<LI>The stop button sometimes doesn't stop things properly (especially
when using libraries). Closing the window to shut things down usually
works fine, though even that might lock up sometimes. Make sure you
save your sketches before you run, in case you have to force-quit. If
this happens to you, please post information about it at <A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=126">Bug 126</A>.
<STRIKE><LI> &ldquo;Export to Application&rdquo; remains unimplemented, 
though we're hoping to have it complete soon. (<A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=60">Bug
60</A>)</STRIKE> Export to Application works in 0097.
<LI>The get(), set(), blend(), loadPixels() and updatePixels() 
functions are fairly broken when using OpenGL. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=91">Bug 91</A>)
<LI>The size of exported applets is larger than we would like, but
we'll get things smaller and more optimize again. Having separated the
2D and 3D libraries, eventually we won't have to include the 3D code
when using 2D. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=127">Bug 127</A>).
<LI><STRIKE>println() can be super slow and often locks things
up</STRIKE> println() issues fixed for Processing release 93.
<LI><STRIKE>Dragging the applet window around will often make
Processing lock up</STRIKE> Fixed in a recent release.
<LI>2D graphics might be a bit flickery sometimes, try setting the
framerate() to get things under control (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=122">Bug 122</A>)
<LI>strokeWeight() is disabled in P3D and OPENGL. Not really a bug
per se (how do you define a stroke in 3D?), but something we'd like to
fix someday. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=123">Bug 123</A>)
<LI>The placement of applets that are 100x100 is sometimes weird. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=128">Bug 128</A>)
<LI><STRIKE>Sometimes things lock up when there are errors in code,
for instance, when using libraries like OpenGL, video, or
net.</STRIKE> (fixed in the early 90s releases, please re-file a bug
if you run into it)
<LI><STRIKE>Errors sometimes don't come through, or are
InvocationTargetExceptions, particularly on the Mac.</STRIKE> (if this
hasn't been fixed please re-file a new bug)
<LI>int() and float() don't always work, use ((int) blah) or ((float)
blah) instead for the time being. or toInt(blah) and toFloat(blah). (<A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4">Bug 4</A>)
<LI>pause() and framerate() aren't working with the video library
<LI>The beloved(?) "History" function from previous versions is
missing. In the meantime, "Archive Sketch" might be useful. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71">Bug 71</A>)
<LI>Need to complete the "Tools" menu, which will be a way for people
to develop their own editor plug-ins. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=124">Bug 124</A>)
<LI>When you have too many tabs, things get ugly (<A
HREF="http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54">Bug 54</A>)
<LI>Save changes before quitting needs a "Cancel" button. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=32">Bug 32</A>)
<LI>Error messages after you hit Run are often too long to read or too
weird to understand
(<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=57">Bug 57</A>)
<LI><STRIKE>updatePixels() seems to stink on the Mac. It can sometimes
cause the screen to not update properly, or for video to contain weird
bands of mixed frames.</STRIKE> Fixed in release 91.
<LI>Lots of little UI things like proper focus or key shortcuts
