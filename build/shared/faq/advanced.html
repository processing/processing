How do I make really large images, or export my images?
</b> <br> <br>
There are several options for creating really large images with
Processing. These fall into two categories, vector and bitmap.
<BR> <BR>
<EM>Creating Vector Images for 2D Graphics</EM>
<UL>
<LI>Vector images, along the lines of an Adobe Illustrator file, have
the benefit that they can be scaled to any size and output at very
high resolution. 
<LI>As of release of 0100 of Processing, it's
possible to create PDF files instead of (or in addition to) drawing to
the screen. The documentation on the site has not yet been updated,
this information will eventually be integrated into the reference when 
we get the time.
<BR> <BR>
In the meantime, a series of examples. The first draws a single frame 
to a PDF file and quits. Note that no window will open, this helps when 
you're trying to create massive PDF images that are far larger than the 
screen size. 

<PRE>

  import processing.pdf.*;

  void setup() {
    size(400, 400, PDF, "filename.pdf");
  }

  void draw() {
    // draw something good here

    // if this is a single frame, get out
    println("finished.");
    exit();
  }

</PRE>

It's also possible to write every frame as a new page:

<PRE>

  import processing.pdf.*;

  void setup() {
    size(400, 400, PDF, "filename.pdf");
  }

  void draw() {
    // draw something good here

    PGraphicsPDF pdf = (PGraphicsPDF) g;  // get the renderer
    pdf.nextPage();  // tell it to go to the next page

    // when finished drawing, quit and save the file
    if (frame == 100) exit();
  }

</PRE>

To draw to the screen while also saving a PDF, use the beginRecord()
and endRecord() functions. This is slower, but is useful when you 
need to see what you're working on as it saves.

<PRE>

  import processing.pdf.*;

  boolean record;

  void setup() {
    size(400, 400);
  }

  void draw() {
    if (record) {
      // note that #### will be replaced with the frame number. fancy!
      beginRecord(PDF, "frame-####.pdf"); 
    }

    // draw something good here

    if (record) {
      endRecord();
    }
  }

  // use a keypress so a million files aren't created
  void mousePressed() {
    record = true;
  }

</PRE>

The following example records absolutely everything that happens while 
a sketch is running. Hitting the 'q' key will quit the sketch. The sketch
calls exit(), which is necessary to make sure that the file is properly
written when complete.

<PRE>

  import processing.pdf.*;

  void setup() {
    size(400, 400);
    beginRecord(PDF, "everything.pdf");
  }

  void draw() {
    // be sure not to call background, otherwise your file
    // will just accumulate lots of mess, only to become invisible
   
    // draw something good here
  }

  void keyPressed() {
    if (key == 'q') {
      endRecord();
      exit();
    }
  }

</PRE>

It's also possible to pause/resume recording along the way. The following
example toggles recording on/off each time you hit the 'r' key. Pressing
the 'q' key will quit the sketch.

<PRE>

  import processing.pdf.*;

  boolean recording;
  PGraphicsPDF pdf;

  void setup() {
    size(400, 400);
    pdf = createGraphics(PDF, "pause-resume.pdf");
  }

  void draw() {
    // be sure not to call background, otherwise your file
    // will just accumulate lots of mess, only to become invisible
   
    // draw something good here
  }

  void keyPressed() {
    if (key == 'r') {
      if (recording) {
        endRecord();
        println("Recording stopped.");
        recording = false;
      } else {
        beginRecord(pdf);
        println("Recording started.");
        recording = true;
      }
    } else if (key == q') {
      if (recording) {
        endRecord();
      }
      exit();
    } 
  }

</PRE>

Super advanced bonus round: To write a PDF file using only the createGraphics() command, rather than as part of a sketch, it's necessary to call dispose() on the PGraphicsPDF object. This is the same as calling exit(), but it won't quit the sketch.

<PRE>

  import processing.pdf.*;

  PGraphicsPDF pdf = createGraphics(300, 300, PDF, "output.pdf");
  pdf.background(128, 0, 0);
  pdf.line(50, 50, 250, 250);
  pdf.dispose();

</PRE>

<LI>There are also contributed libraries for exporting images to SVG
and Adobe Illustrator format, check the <A
HREF="http://processing.org/libraries/">libraries</A> section of the
site for more information.
</UL>

<EM>Creating Vector Images from 3D Graphics</EM>

<UL>
<LI>To create vectors from 3D data, use the beginRaw() and endRaw() commands. These commands will grab the shape data just before it is rendered to the screen. At this stage, your entire scene is nothing but a long list of lines and triangles. This means that a shape created with sphere() method will be made up of hundreds of triangles, rather than a single object.
<LI>When using beginRaw() and endRaw(), it's possible to write to either a 2D or 3D renderer. For instance, beginRaw() with the PDF library will write the geometry as flattened triangles and lines. Using the DXF library instead will save the file as 3D data.
<LI>The use of the DXF library is just like the PDF library, and is described <A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/reference/everything/javadoc/processing/dxf/RawDXF.html">here</A> in the developer's reference. 
<LI>To do the same thing with PDF, use the following:
<PRE>

  import processing.pdf.*;

  boolean record;

  void setup() {
    size(500, 500, P3D);
  }

  // hit 'r' to record a single frame
  void keyPressed() {
    if (key == 'r') record = true;
  }

  void draw() {
    if (record) {
      beginRaw(PDF, "output.pdf");
    }

    // do all your drawing here

    if (record) {
      endRaw();
      record = false;
    }
  }

</PRE>
<LI>If the results when drawing from P3D or OPENGL to PDF look bizarre, it's probably because the polygons are not sorted. To attempt sorting of 3D shapes before they're written to a file, use hint(ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT). This method is still not particularly good, but will help in some situations. See <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=176">Bug #176</A> for status of the implementation.
</UL>

<EM>Creating Bitmap Images</EM>
<UL>
<LI>The basic way to create bitmap images is to use the <A
HREF="http://processing.org/reference/saveFrame_.html">saveFrame()</A>
function. 
<LI>If you want to create a really large scene and write that, first
make sure that you've <A HREF="bugs.html#memory">allocated a lot of memory</A>.
<LI>If you want to create images that are larger than the screen, you
should create your own PGraphics object, draw to that, and use <A
HREF="http://processing.org/reference/save_.html">save()</A>. For now,
it's best to use <A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/reference/everything/javadoc/processing/core/PGraphics3.html">P3D</A> in this scenario. P2D is currently disabled, and the JAVA2D default will give mixed results. So for instance:
<PRE>

PGraphics big;

void setup() {
  big = createGraphics(3000, 3000, P3D);

  big.beginDraw();
  big.background(128);
  big.line(20, 1800, 1800, 900);
  // etc..
  big.endDraw();

  // make sure the file is written to the sketch folder
  String path = savePath("big.tif");
  big.save(path);
}

</PRE>
And again, be sure to allocate lots of memory before trying this. Read the
memory section carefully, it can be confusing.
<LI>It's important to always wrap drawing to createGraphics() with beginDraw() and endDraw() (beginFrame() and endFrame() prior to revision 0115). The reason is that the renderer needs to know when drawing has stopped, so that it can update itself internally. This also handles calling the defaults() method, for people familiar with that.
<LI>It's not possible to use createGraphics() with OPENGL, because it doesn't allow offscreen use. 
<LI>With Processing 0115 and later, it's possible to write images in formats other than the default .tga and .tiff. The exact formats and background information can be found in the developer's reference for <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/reference/core/javadoc/processing/core/PImage.html#save(java.lang.String)">PImage.save()</A>.

How do I move the mouse cursor to another location?

If you want to control the position of the mouse cursor, rather than just reading it, you'll need to Java's AWT Robot class. The API reference for this class can be found

      <b>
Using the (default) Java2D renderer
</b> <br> <br>
<UL>
<LI>Pixel operations too slow? As of release 0085 (the first beta), the default renderer uses Java2D. It's more accurate than the renderer used in alpha (handles stroke caps and joins, better polygon tessellation), 
but is super slow for handling pixels. At least until we get a chance 
to get the old 2D renderer working in a similar fashion, 
you can use <TT>size(w, h, P3D)</TT>
instead of <TT>size(w, h)</TT> which will be faster for general pixel flipping
madness.
<LI>To get access to the Java 2D "Graphics2D" object for the default
renderer, use:
<PRE>Graphics2D g2 = ((PGraphics2)g).g2;</PRE>
This will let you do Java 2D stuff directly, but is not supported in
any way shape or form. Which just means "have fun, but don't complain
if it breaks."

Using the OpenGL renderer
</b> <br> <br>
<UL>
<LI>To get access to the GL object, you can use the following:
<PRE>GL gl = ((PGraphicsGL)g).gl;</PRE>
This will give you the <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/">jogl</a> 
object that talks directly to OpenGL and will let you make OpenGL 
calls directly. Note, however, that <em>this is not supported</em>, 
in the sense that if you get weird problems with a GL-based sketch
that uses this method, you're on your own. Processing is not intended
as a nice wrapper on top of OpenGL. Instead, we're using OpenGL 
graphics for one implementation of the Processing Core API.
<BR>
Because most of the work in drawing is handled by Processing, most
OpenGL calls will not work, because the model and perspective matrices
won't be set up properly. Therefore, using the GL object will mostly
only be useful for tweaking obscure OpenGL parameters.
<LI>Another option for talking directly to OpenGL in release 0116 and 
later is to use the beginGL() and endGL() methods. These were added 
against my better judgement, and handle setting up the camera matrices.
Lighting and other features still will not work. An example:
<PRE>

import javax.media.opengl.*;

void setup() {
  size(400, 400, OPENGL);
}

void draw() {
  PGraphicsGL pgl = (PGraphicsGL) g;
  GL gl = pgl.beginGL();
  // do some things with gl.xxx functions here
  pgl.endGL();
}

</PRE>
Generally, this should be only considered a last-ditch way to get 
at a particular GL-specific feature. 
It makes your code completely incompatible with everything else 
(such as future versions of Processing, or other 3D renderers) 
and will confuse the hell outta people when you post
your code to the web. Again, if this works for you great, but if not, 
we're not gonna field questions about it on the board.
Man, how I'm gonna regret this.
