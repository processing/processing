Exporting Applets
</b> <br> <br>
<UL>
<LI>To customize the HTML that's included when an applet is exported, 
copy the applet.html file from Processing &rarr; lib &rarr; export to 
the root of your sketch folder. Because the applet folder is rewritten 
on each export, using applet.html will allow you to customize the template
and have it rewrite properly each time.
<LI>When exporting an applet, a description can be included on the default 
HTML page that's created. Processing will include everything from 
the first instance of /** to a closing */ as a javadoc comment. 
So you can add this to your sketch:
<PRE>
  /**
   * You can't rock Processing like I can rock Processing.
   */
</PRE>
  and that text would automatically be embedded in the exported html 
  page. Like a javadoc comment, the text can (and should) be any valid
  html since it will be embedded directly in the page. Asterisks
at the left of each line will be removed.

How do I avoid applet security restrictions?
</b> <br> <br>
Applets running inside a web browser have several security restrictions, in order to protect web users. For instance, an applet cannot read files from the local disk or connect to servers other than the server from which it came. To avoid these restrictions, it's possible to "sign" an applet. In a signed applet, a dialog box will appear to ask the user whether they trust you as the provider of the applet, and if it's ok for the applet to perform actions that might be a security risk. More information can be found in
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/">Sun's documentation</A>. 
<!--<br> <br>
Making a Tool that would allow users to export a signed applet directly from the Tools menu would make a nice project. Hint, hint.-->

Fun with "Export to Application"
</b> <br> <br>
The "Export to Application" is implemented as of release 0097. 
If you find problems, <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">file a bug</A>.
<UL>
<LI>Just like when exporting as an applet, the "application.xxxx"
folders will be removed completely on export.
<LI>It is important that you don't have a method named main() in your
sketch, unless you know what you're doing (writing your own
main). Otherwise this will fool the preprocessor into thinking you
have a clue, when in fact you don't.
<LI>If running in "Java" mode, where your code starts "public class
blah extends PApplet", you'll need to write your own main() method in
order for Export to Application to work. It should look something like this:
<PRE>
static public void main(String args[]) {
  PApplet.main(new String[] { "YourClassName" });
}
</PRE>
Not doing this, or using your own main can cause problems internally
with variables not being properly set up. If you opt not to use
PApplet.main(), make sure you read the source code for it so that you
understand how it works, and don't whine if it breaks.
<LI>To make an exported application run in "present" mode, you'll have 
to write your own main(). It needs to look something like this:
<PRE>
static public void main(String args[]) {
  PApplet.main(new String[] { "--display", "YourClassName" });
}
</PRE>
Other advanced options (like how to hide the stop button) can be read in the 
<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/reference/core/javadoc/processing/core/PApplet.html#main(java.lang.String[])">developer's reference</A> for main(). In a future release, this will be part of an export options dialog.
<LI>The "Movie" and "Capture" examples do not yet work properly, this
will be fixed shortly. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=230">Bug 230</A>)
<LI>Exporting sketches that use the video library may be broken, it's
not clear the extent of this issue (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=231">Bug
231</A>), but it will be repaired for a future release. 
<LI>Export to Application will create sketches for Windows, Mac OS X,
and Linux. Someday we might implement a dialog box that lets you
select which one you actually want, but for now, enjoy the bounty.
<LI>When exporting for Mac OS X from Windows, be sure to read through
the readme.txt file in the application.macosx folder&mdash;your
application likely won't work on Mac OS X without a minor
modification.
<LI>The Mac OS X export is a nice .app bundle like a regular OS X
application. You can change the icon or edit its settings by using
"Show Package Contents" and editing Info.plist or replacing
sketch.icns with something more exciting.
<LI>Windows is a shell .exe that calls the code and requires the "lib"
folder along with it be kept intact. Someday we might make Windows be
a nice single .exe file, but this requires more time to implement, and
more specifically, make work consistently with the libraries. If
you're finicky about this, use a Java EXE generator such as <A
HREF="http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/">JSmooth</A> or <A
HREF="http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/">launch4j</A>.
<LI>To set the icon used on the title bar for Windows, use the
following code: (submitted by dxtx)
<PRE>
ImageIcon titlebaricon = new ImageIcon(loadBytes("myicon.gif"));
frame.setIconImage(titlebaricon.getImage());
</PRE>
Note that within the PDE, the icon will only show up when a code 
folder is in use or a library has been imported. However, it should
show up on all occasions when exported to an application.
<LI>Linux is just a shell script, which can probably be used on most
Unix platforms (there's almost nothing to it). 
<LI>When distributing your application, the "source" folder can be
removed from the export if you'd like, but other files (such as the
lib folder and any .dll files or whatever) should be left intact
otherwise the application may not work properly.
<LI>If you just want an executable jar file, export as an
applet. Executable jar files will most likely not work with
libraries because the path information will not be properly set, and
the additional library jars won't be referenced. 
<LI>Library writers can now specify what files to export for each
platform, see the updated libraries/howto.txt for more information.
<LI>Your current memory settings will be exported with the
application. If you've set outrageous memory requirements, you might
want to undo that before exporting for others, or edit the exported
files by hand (Contents/Resources/Info.plist on Mac OS X and
lib/args.txt on Windows).
<LI>If you want to replace (or add) titlebar text, just do this in
setup():
<PRE>
frame.setTitle("This is in the titlebar!"); </PRE>
(thanks dxtx for pointing this out)
<LI>Holding down shift while clicking "Export" on the toolbar will
export to application instead of an applet.
<LI>Users must still have Java installed to use your exported
application. You can also copy the "java" folder from Processing to
the same folder as your app so that users needn't install their own
Java (this is the same as the "standard" version of processing), or
you want to ensure that a certain version of the VM is used. For the
time being, the error message when Java is installed may be
nonexistant or cryptic. 
<LI>Someday we'll also add features like icon files and whatnot. Or at
least a default icon for the exported stuff. Or maybe even a splash
screen while the VM is loading. Again, if you want more control, use
your own application generator (see above for Windows, or use the Java
package maker whatchamacallit on Mac OS X).

Features of "Present" mode
</b> <br> <br>
<UL>
<LI>The ESC key will quit a sketch, even in Present mode. To prevent this 
from happening, intercept the ESC on keyPressed() so that it isn't passed
through to PApplet. Like so:
<PRE>

void keyPressed() {
  if (key == ESC) {
    key = 0;  // fools! don't let them escape!
  }
}

</PRE>
<LI>You can hide the stop button with the --hide-stop command line option 
to PApplet. More details are above in the "Export to Application" section. 
From inside the Processing environment, you can't hide the stop button 
(unless your sketch window obscures it anyway) easily, so better to export
as an application.
