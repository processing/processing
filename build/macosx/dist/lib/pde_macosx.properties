# the usual 12 point from other platforms is too big on osx

# monospaced on java 1.3 was monaco, but on 1.4 it has changed
# to courier, which actually matches other platforms better.
# (and removes the 12 point being too large issue)
#editor.program.font = Monospaced,plain,10
#editor.console.font = Monospaced,plain,10

# ...but monaco is nicer on macosx, so use that explicitly
editor.program.font = Monaco,plain,10
editor.console.font = Monaco,plain,10
