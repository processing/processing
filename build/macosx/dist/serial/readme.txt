README / WARNING! MILDLY DANGEROUS

this is a package of the installer for rxtx, which enables serial port
support under Mac OS X. more details can be found at http://rxtx.org/

the installer, and the necessary steps to get things working aren't
necessarily pretty.. we hope to fix this in a future release of
processing, but for the time being, this is the best we can offer.
