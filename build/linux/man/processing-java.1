.PP
.RB "The " --build ", " --run ", " --present ", or " --export
must be the final parameter passed to Processing.
Arguments passed following one of those four will be passed through to the
sketch itself, and therefore available to the sketch via the 'args' field.
To pass options understood by PApplet.main(), write a custom main() method
so that the preprocessor does not add one.
