  echo It appears that the version of Jikes distributed with Processing
  echo cannot properly run on this system.
  echo 
  echo Possible solutions:
  echo
  echo + If you already have Jikes installed on your system, you may
  echo   just need to remove the version that is included with Processing.
  echo
  echo + You probably just need to track down a version of Jikes that will 
  echo   work with your distribution.
  echo 
  echo + You may need to install the rpm/package for compat-libstdc++
  echo   This is what it takes to get things running on most versions
  echo   of RedHat Linux or Fedora Core.
  echo 
  echo + If all else fails, or if you just like building stuff yourself,
  echo   you can download the source for Jikes from SourceForge:
  echo   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128803
  echo   And it just takes a simple ./configure and make, followed by
  echo   copying src/jikes to the processing-XXXX folder and you should 
  echo   be all set. 
  echo
  echo If you get stuck, ask questions online from the helpful folks via 
  echo the Processing discussion board: http://processing.org/discourse/
  echo
  echo Good luck!
