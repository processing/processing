  echo "It appears that the version of Jikes distributed with Processing
cannot properly run on this system.
 
Possible solutions:
 
+ If you already have Jikes installed on your system, you may
  just need to remove the version that is included with Processing.
 
+ You probably just need to track down a version of Jikes that will
  work with your distribution.
 
+ You may need to install the rpm/package for compat-libstdc++
  This is what it takes to get things running on most versions
  of RedHat Linux or Fedora Core.
 
+ If all else fails, or if you just like building stuff yourself,
  you can download the source for Jikes from SourceForge:
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128803
  And it just takes a simple ./configure and make, followed by
  copying src/jikes to the processing-XXXX folder and you should
  be all set.
 
If you get stuck, ask questions online from the helpful folks via
the Processing discussion board: http://processing.org/discourse/
 
Good luck!"
