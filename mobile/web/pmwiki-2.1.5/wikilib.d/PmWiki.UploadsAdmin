text=(:title Uploads Administration:)%0a[[PmWiki]] has a feature script called ''upload.php'' that allows users to [[upload(s)]] files to the wiki server from a web browser.  These files can then be easily accessed using markup within wiki pages.  This page describes how to install and configure the upload feature.%0a%0a!!!Some notes about security%0a%0a# Keep in mind that letting users (anonymously!) upload files to your web server does entail some amount of risk.  The ''upload.php'' script has been designed to reduce the hazards, but [[wiki administrator]]s should be aware that the potential for vulnerabilities exist, and that misconfiguration of the upload utility could lead to unwanted consequences.%0a%0a# By default, authorized users are able to overwrite files that have already been uploaded, without the possibility of restoring the previous version of the file.  If you want to disallow users from being able to overwrite files that have already been uploaded, add the following line to ''config.php'':%0a%0a        $EnableUploadOverwrite = 0;%0a%0a!!!Basic installation%0a%0aThe ''upload.php'' script is automatically included from ''stdconfig.php'' if the $EnableUpload variable is true in ''config.php''.  In addition, ''config.php'' can set the $UploadDir and $UploadUrlFmt variables to specify the local directory where uploaded files should be stored, and the URL that can be used to access that directory.  By default, $UploadDir and $UploadUrlFmt assume that uploads will be stored in a directory called ''uploads/'' within the current directory (usually the one containing ''pmwiki.php'').  In addition, ''config.php'' should also set a default upload password (see PasswordsAdmin).%0a%0aThus, a basic ''config.php'' for uploads might look like:%0a%0a    %3c?php%0a      $EnableUpload = 1;%0a      $UploadDir = "/home/john/public_html/uploads";%0a      $UploadUrlFmt = [="http://www.john.com/~john/uploads";=]%0a      $DefaultPasswords['upload'] = crypt('mysecret');%0a      ## more configuration entries here...%0a    ?>%0a%0a'''Important''': do NOT create the uploads directory yet! See the next paragraph.%0a%0a!!!!The upload directory%0aFor the upload feature to work properly, the directory given by [=$UploadDir=] must be writable by the web server process, and it must be in a location that is accessible to the web somewhere (e.g., in a subdirectory of ''public_html'').  Executing PmWiki with uploads enabled will prompt you with the set of steps required to create the uploads directory on your server (it differs from one server to the next).%0a%0a!!!!Uploading a file%0aOnce the upload feature is enabled, users can access the upload form by adding "@@?action=upload@@" to the end of a normal PmWiki URL.  The user will be prompted for an upload password similar to the way other pages ask for passwords (see [[Passwords]] and [[PasswordsAdmin]] for information about setting passwords on pages, groups, and the entire site).%0a%0aAnother way to access the upload form to insert the markup "[@Attach:filename.ext@]" into an existing page, where @@filename.ext@@ is the name of a new file to be uploaded.  When the page is displayed, a '?-link' will be added to the end of the markup to take the author to the upload page.%0a%0aBy default, PmWiki will organize the uploaded files into separate subdirectories for each group.  This can be changed by modifying the $UploadPrefixFmt variable. See [[Cookbook:UploadGroups]] for details.%0a%0a!!!Versioning Uploaded Files%0a%0aPmWiki does not manage versioning of uploaded files by default. However, by setting $EnableUploadVersions=1; an administrator can have older versions of uploads preserved in the uploads directory along with the most recent version.%0a%0a!!!Restricting uploaded files for groups and pages%0a%0aUploads can be enabled only for specific groups or pages by using a [[per group customization(s)]].  Simply set @@$EnableUpload=1;@@ for those groups or pages where uploading is to be enabled; alternately, set @@$EnableUpload=1;@@ in the config.php file and then set @@$EnableUpload=0;@@ in the per-group or per-page customization files where uploads are to be disabled.%0a%0a[[#restrictinguploadedfiles]]%0a!!!Restricting uploaded files type and size%0a%0aThe upload script performs a number of verifications on an uploaded file before storing it in the upload directory.  The basic verifications are described below.%0a:'''filenames''': the name for the uploaded file can contain only letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, spaces, and periods, and the name must begin and end with a letter or digit.  %0a:'''file extension''': only files with approved extensions such as "@@.gif@@", "@@.jpeg@@", "@@.doc@@", etc. are allowed to be uploaded to the web server.  This is vitally important for server security, since the web server might attempt to execute or specially process files with extensions like "@@.php@@", "@@.cgi@@", etc.  %0a:'''file size''': By default all uploads are limited to 50K bytes, as specified by the $UploadMaxSize variable.  Thus, to limit all uploads to 100K, simply specify a new value for $UploadMaxSize in ''config.php'':%0a%0a        $UploadMaxSize = 100000;%0a%0aHowever, maximum file sizes can also be specified for each type of file uploaded.  Thus, an administrator can restrict "@@.gif@@" and "@@.jpeg@@" files to 20K, "@@.doc@@" files to 200K, and all others to the size given by $UploadMaxSize.  The $UploadExtSize array is used to determine which file extensions are valid and the maximum upload size (in bytes) for each file type.  For example:%0a%0a        $UploadExtSize['gif'] = 20000;       # limit .gif files to 20K%0a%0aSetting an entry to zero disables file uploads of that type altogether:%0a%0a        $UploadExtSize['zip'] = 0;           # disallow .zip files %0a%0a[[#newuploadfiletypes]]%0a!!!Adding new filetypes to permitted uploads%0a%0aTo add a new extension to the list of allowed upload types, add a line like the following to a [[local customization(s)]] file:%0a%0a        $UploadExts['ext'] = 'content-type';%0a%0awhere ''ext'' is the extension to be added, and ''content-type'' is the content-type (MIME type) to be used for files with that extension.  For example, to add the '[@dxf@]' extension with a Content-Type of '[@image/x-dxf@]', place the line%0a%0a        $UploadExts['dxf'] = 'image/x-dxf';%0a%0a[[#otherfilesizelimits]]%0a!!!Other file size limits%0aThere are other factors involved that affect upload file sizes.  In Apache 2.0, there is a `LimitRequestBody directive that controls the maximum size of anything that is posted (including file uploads).  Apache has this defaulted to unlimited size.  However, some Linux distributions (e.g., Red Hat Linux) limit postings to 512K so this may need to be changed or increased.  (Normally these settings are in an ''httpd.conf'' configuration file or in a file in ''/etc/httpd/conf.d''.)%0a%0aProblem noted on Red Hat 8.0/9.0 with Apache 2.0.x, the error "Requested content-length of 670955 is larger than the configured limit of 524288" was occuring under Apache and a "Page not found" would appear in the browser. Trying the above settings made no change with PHP, but on Red Hat 8.0/9.0 there is an additional PHP config file, /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf, and increasing the number on the line "`LimitRequestBody 524288" solves the issue.%0a%0aPHP itself has two limits on file uploads (usually located in /etc/php.ini).  The first is the @@upload_max_filesize@@ parameter, which is set to 2M by default.  The second is @@post_max_size@@, which is set to 6M by default.%0a%0aWith the variables in place--PmWiki's maximum file size, Apache's request-size limits, and the PHP file size parameters, the maximum uploaded file size will be the smallest of the three variables.%0a%0a!!!Password protecting uploaded files%0aSetting a  read password for pages (and groups) will prevent an attached file to be seen or accessed through the page, but to prevent direct access to the file location (the uploads/ directory) one can do the following:%0a %0a* In local/config.php set $EnableDirectDownload=0; %0a* Deny public access to the uploads/ directory through moving it out of the html/ or public_html/ directory tree, or through a .htaccess file. %0a%0aSee [[Cookbook:SecureAttachments]].  %0a%0a!!!Other notes%0a%0a* If uploads doesn't seem to work, make sure that your PHP installation allows uploads.  The ''php.ini'' file (usually ''/etc/php.ini'' or ''/usr/local/lib/php.ini'') should have  %0a%0a    file_uploads = On%0a%0aNote that if you change this value, httpd must generally be restarted.  Another way to check if uploads are allowed by the server is to set $EnableDiag to 1 in ''config.php'', and set ?action=phpinfo on a URL. The "@@file_uploads@@" variable must have a value of 1 (if it says "@@no value@@", that means it's off).%0a%0a-----%0a%0aEach entry in $UploadExts needs to be the extension and the%0amime-type associated with that extension, thus:%0a%0a->[@%0a$UploadExts = array(%0a  'gif' => 'image/gif',%0a  'jpeg' => 'image/jpeg',%0a  'jpg' => 'image/jpeg',%0a  'png' => 'image/png',%0a  'xxx' => 'yyyy/zzz'%0a)%0a@]%0a%0aFor the types that PmWiki already knows about it's not necessary%0ato repeat them here (the ''upload.php'' script adds PmWiki's defaults%0ato whatever the administrator supplies).%0a%0a%25trail%25%3c%3c|[[DocumentationIndex]]|>>%0a>>faq%3c%3c [[#faq]]%0a%0aQ: How do I disable uploading of a certain type of file?%0aA: Here's an example of what to add to your ''local/config.php'' file to disable uploading of .zip files:%0a [=%0a$UploadExtSize['zip'] = 0;  # Disallow uploading .zip files.=]%0a
