text=(:title Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):)%0a%0aThis page attempts to answer the more common questions you might have.%0aMany of the answers refer you to other pages for details.%0a%0aFor frequently requested features, see the [[(PITS:)PITS]] pages.%0a%0a>>faq%3c%3c%0a%0a%0a!! Questions%0aQ: How do I get my question answered?%0aA: The quickest and best way is to join the pmwiki-users [[mailing list(s)]] and post your question there. If it really is a frequently-asked question, it will eventually be added to this page.%0a%0aAn alternative way is to leave your question on the [[(PmWiki:)Questions]] page.%0a%0a%0a!! Getting help%0aQ: Where can I get help with PmWiki? (This is a pretty vague question!)%0aA: See this FAQ, [[Troubleshooting]], or try a [[Site/Search]].%0a%0a%0a!! Error messages%0aQ: What does warning message or error message "xxxxx" mean?%0aA: Error/warning questions and answers are on the [[Troubleshooting]] page.%0a%0a%0a!! Special characters%0aQ: How do I include special characters on my wiki pages?%0aA: Use character codes to insert [[special characters]], such as Copyright (&#169;) and Trademark (&#174; or &#8482;) symbols, that don't appear on your keyboard.%0a%0a!! Images%0aQ: How do I insert pictures on wiki pages?%0aA: See [[Images]].%0a%0a!!! Image in another group%0aQ: How do I link to an uploaded image from another group?%0aA: You need to refer to a page within another group, not just the group itself. Thus, [@Attach:Group.SomePage/image_name.ext@]. Note, you must use the PageName, but that there is no requirement that the page actually exist.%0a%0a!!! Attachment links%0aQ: When I upload a file, how do I make the link look like "file.doc" instead of "Attach:file.doc"?%0aA: Use parentheses, as in [@[[(Attach:)file.doc]]@].  There is also a configuration change that can eliminate the [@Attach:@] -- see [[Cookbook:AttachLinks]].%0a%0a!!! Upload file size limit%0aQ: Why can't I upload files of size more than 50kB to my newly installed PmWiki?%0aA: Out of the box PmWiki limits the size of files to be uploaded to 50kB. Add%0a%0a        $UploadMaxSize = 1000000;%0a%0ato your ''config.php'' to increase the limit to 1MB (for example). See [[UploadsAdmin]]%0afor how to further customize limits.  Note that both PHP and webservers also place their own limits on the size of uploaded files.%0a%0a%0a!! Tables%0aQ: How do I create nice tables similar to Product X?  %0aA: See [[tables]] and [[table directives]].%0a%0a%0a!! Access control%0aQ: How do I use passwd-formatted files (like .htpasswd) for authentication?%0aA: See [[AuthUser]] or [[Cookbook:UserAuth]]%0a%0a%0a!! Spam%0aQ: I'm getting a lot of spam on my wiki site.  How can I password protect the pages?%0aA: See [[Security]], [[UrlApprovals]], and the [[Cookbook:Blocklist2]] recipe.%0a%0a%0a!! Summary pages%0aQ: Why are 'RecentChanges' pages editable?%0aA: You might want to edit these pages if a spammer creates a page with an unsavory name. To prevent others from editing these pages, insert the following lines into your ''local/config.php'' file. Editing then requires the admin password.%0a%0a->[@%0a## Require admin password to edit RecentChanges (etc.) pages.%0aif ($action=='edit'%0a    && preg_match('/\\.(All)?RecentChanges$/', $pagename))%0a  { $DefaultPasswords['edit'] = '*'; }%0a@]%0a%0a%0a!! SourceForge%0aQ: Is it possible to move wiki.d to /tmp/persistent/wiki.d (a new sourceforge rule)?%0aA: Sourceforge suggest moving everything to /tmp/persistent/new-folder-of-your-choice and creating a symbolic link to the new folder on /tmp . It works. See [[Cookbook:SourceForgeServers]]%0a%0a%0a!! Headers%0aQ: How do I set one Header for all pages/groups?%0aA: The header for each page is controlled by the $GroupHeaderFmt variable.  Thus a site-wide groupheader can be added with%0a->[@$GroupHeaderFmt .=%0a  "(:include {$SiteGroup}.SiteHeader:)(:include {$Group}.GroupHeader:)(:nl:)%0a@]%0a%0a%0a!! Feeds%0aQ: How do I insert RSS news feeds in PmWiki?%0aA: See [[Cookbook:RssFeedDisplay]].%0a%0aQ: How do I generate RSS feeds from PmWiki?%0aA: See [[Web Feeds]].%0a%0a%0a!! Title%0aQ: How do I change the Wiki's default name in the upper left corner of the Main Page?%0aA: Put the following config.php%0a%0a->[@$WikiTitle = 'My Wiki Site';@]%0a%0aThe ''docs/sample-config.php'' has an example of changing the title.%0a%0a%0a!! CSS Styling%0aQ: How do I customize the CSS styling of my PmWiki layout?[[#customcss]]%0aA: See [[Skins]] for how to change the default PmWiki skin.  See also [[Cookbook:Skins]], where you will find pre-made templates you can use to customize the appearance of your site.  You can also create a file called ''local.css'' in the ''pub/css/'' directory and add CSS selectors there (this file gets automatically loaded if it exists).  Or, styles can be added directly into a local customization file by using something like:%0a%0a->[@$HTMLStylesFmt[] = '.foo { color:blue; }';@]%0a%0a%0a!! Styling the edit page hint block%0aQ: How do I change the font or background color of the hints block on the Edit Page?%0aA: Add a CSS style to pub/css/local.css: [@.quickref {background:...; color:... }@]. The hints are provided by the [[Site.EditQuickReference]] page, which is in the PmWiki or Site wikigroup.  Edit that page, and change the "bgcolor" or specify the font "color" to get the contrast you need.%0a%0a%0a!! Default page%0aQ: How do I make pmwiki.php the default page for a website?  Should I rename pmwiki.php to index.php?%0aA: Renaming pmwiki.php is not recommended. Instead, create an ''index.php'' file that contains the single line:%0a%0a->[@%3c?php include_once('pmwiki.php');@]%0a%0aYou may also want to check [[Cookbook:CleanUrls]].%0a%0a%0a!! Default password%0aQ: There seems to be a default password.  What is it? [[#pwlocked]]%0aA: There isn't any valid password until you set one.  See [[PasswordsAdmin]] for how to set an admin password.%0a%0aPmWiki comes "out of the box" with $DefaultPasswords['admin'] set to '*'.   This doesn't mean the password%0ais an asterisk, it means that default admin password has to be something that encrypts to an asterisk.  Since it's impossible for the crypt() function to ever return a 1-character encrypted value, the admin password is effectively locked until the admin sets one in config.php.%0a%0a%0a!! Embedding inside a web page%0aQ: How can I embed PmWiki pages inside a web page?%0aA: Source them through a PHP page, or place them in a frame.%0a%0a%0a!! Closing ?> tags%0aQ: Why don't [=PmWiki's=] scripts have a closing ?> tag?%0aA: All of [=PmWiki's=] scripts now omit the closing ?> tag.  The tag is not%0arequired, and it avoids problems with unnoticed spaces or blank%0alines at the end of the file.  Also, some file transfer protocols%0amay change the newline character(s) in the file, which can also%0acause problems. --Pm%0a%0a%0a!! Directory-like URLs%0aQ: Why does pmwiki.org appear to have a directory structure rather than "?n=pagename" in [=URLs=]?%0aA: Pmwiki.org uses a variant of [[Cookbook:CleanUrls]].%0a%0a%0a!! Hierarchical Groups%0aQ: Why doesn't PmWiki  use hierarchical / nested groups?%0aA: It essentially comes down to%0afiguring out how to handle page links between nested groups; if%0asomeone can figure out an obvious, intuitive way for authors to%0ado that, then nested groups become plausible.  See [[DesignNotes]]%0aand [[PmWiki:HierarchicalGroups]].%0a%0a%0a!! ''wikilib.d'' folder%0aQ: Can I remove items from the wikilib.d folder on my site?%0aA: Yes, the files in ''wikilib.d/'' can be safely removed.  They'll reappear again when you upgrade, however.  If you want to permanently configure your site so that these distribution pages don't appear, try:%0a%0a->[@$WikiLibDirs = array(&$WikiDir);@]%0a%0a%0a!! Exclude from search%0aQ: How do I exclude wiki-related pages from searches?%0aTry the following in your ''local/config.php file''.  See also [[Cookbook:SearchPatterns]].%0a%0a->[@%0a## Exclude Certain pages / groups from search results.%0a$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!\\.(All)?Recent(Changes|Uploads)$!';%0a$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!\\.Group(Print)?Header$!';%0a$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!^Site\\.!';%0a$SearchPatterns['default'][] = '!^PmWiki\\.!';%0a@]%0a%0a%0a!! Links%0a!!! Links opening a new window%0aQ: How do I put a link that will open as a new window?%0aA: Use the [@%25newwin%25@] wikistyle, as in:%0a(:markup:) [=%25newwin%25http://www.example.com/=]%0a%0a!!! Linking to an image%0aQ: Is it possible to link an image on PmWiki without using a fully qualified URL?%0aA: Yes. For images that are attachments, the general format is [@Attach:Group.PageName/image.gif@].  To link to an image that is on the same server, use [@Path:/path/to/image.gif@].%0a%0a!!! Link to an e-mail address%0aQ: How do I place a mailing address in a page?%0aA: Use the [@mailto:@] markup, as in one of the following:%0a%0a(:markup:) [=%0amailto:myaddress@example.com%0a%0a[[mailto:myaddress@example.com]]%0a%0a[[mailto:myaddress@example.com | email me]]%0a=]%0a%0aSee also [[Cookbook:EProtect]] for information on protecting email addresses from spammers.%0a%0a%0a!!! External links%0aQ: How do I make a WikiWord link to an external page instead of a WikiPage?%0aA: Use link markup.  There are two formats:%0a(:markup:) [=[[http://www.example.com/ | WikiWord]]=]%0aor%0a(:markup:) [=[[WikiWord -> http://www.example.com/]]=]%0a%0a!!! Backlinks ("Who links here")%0aQ: How do I find all of the pages that link to another page (i.e., backlinks)?%0aA: Use the [@(:pagelist:)@] command, as in%0a%0a    [@(:pagelist link=SomePage:)   -- show all links to SomePage%0a    (:pagelist link={$FullName}:)  -- show all links to the current page@]%0a%0a%0a!! 404 page%0aQ: How do I customize my own 404 error page for non-existent pages?%0a%0aA: To change the text of the message, try editing the [[Site.PageNotFound]] page.%0a%0a%0a!! Standalone%0aQ: How can I run PmWiki on a standalone (offline, portable) machine ?%0aA: See [[Cookbook:Standalone]].%0a%0a%0a!! Disable formatting%0aQ: How do I put plain text into a wiki page and disable wiki formatting?%0aA: You can use the [=[@TEXT GOES HERE@]=] markup as explained in the section Escape Sequence [[PmWiki/TextFormattingRules]].  Note that this preserves any text file formatting such as newlines and spaces.%0a%0a%0a(:pagelist trail=PmWiki.DocumentationIndex "[[#faq]]" fmt=#includefaq:)
