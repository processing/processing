040621 monday mid-day
X see if changing the sketchbook location actually works
X   after changing sketchbook location, need to rebuild the menu
X hide the editor window while prefs is open
X   this way the prefs can be properly applied

X   'new sketch' goes into the wrong folder
X   but saving and all that works properly
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083184449;start=0

X maybe bring back the prompt option for "new sketch"
X   sometimes nice just to have it create an unnamed sketch quickly
X   shift-new will always prompt with filedialog
X dashes shouldn't be allowed in filenames for sketches
X   actually, lost the naming stuff because now using FileDialog
X   this also needs to be checked when building the sketch menu 
X rewrite sketchbook.clean()

X   add a pref to the preferences window

040622 monday late night
X set handleOpen to use editor as its parent frame
X what happens when the .pde file isn't named 
X   the same as the enclosing folder?
X   maybe put up a window saying no way, and ask:
X   ( ) rename enclosing or ( ) add a subfolder
X   or maybe even ( ) rename the sketch file
X   also double-check to see if there *is* a proper pde in the folder
X     in which case, default to that (maybe show a message?)
X   it's useful to have loose .pde files be runnable..
X   i.e. when double-clicking on them.. downloaded off web.. 
X     but need to deal with simply, not providing a new exception case
X begin writing 'new text file'

040622 tuesday morning / early afternoon

040706 discuss with casey
X how should history be handled
X   per-sketch, not per-file
X   just looks like old history setup anyways
X is the sketch folder something that is never seen by the user?
X   i.e. flash programs 'import' all data, etc
X   same with how imovie works
X   no, not for 1.0
o jikes is exporting column as well.. use it?
o   3:23:3:25 -> line 3, col 23 to 25
o   decided a bad idea, too difficult
X don't bother with 'advanced' on export dialog
X   that can come later, if needed
X how to handle .pde vs .java
X   how to determine what the 'main' file is
X   sun won't want us to say things are .java when they aren't
X .pde files opened on their own
X what should the prefs file be named?
X horizontal buttons? need final decision [yes]
X remove underscores from the tab title?
X   nope, casey says not necessary
X need nice yes/no dialog boxes, also 
o does "Open" go at the beginning or end of the sketch popup
X we need opengl support in there
X   otherwise we're going to be stuck behind director
X   go with sun's jogl project
X core.jar included with .class? or make one jar?
X libraries and package naming for core & serial etc
X vec3f, matrix4f classes.. our own or java3d?

other stuff / cleaning up
X don't allow apostrophe (i.e. casey's_cells) when naming sketch!
X when exporting applet, line numbers will be off.. 
o   when not exporting with new preproc code, imports all on same line
o   make preproc keep track of how many lines were added
X rewrite video, net, serial libraries to be separate
X move the mac to java 1.4
X   1.4 is being used externally, and wheel mouse would be nice
X   not doing currently, lots of strange repaint bugs
X     all fixable for sure, but no point before beta since low priority
X macosx.. random lockups seem common in 1.4
o completeness of toInt/toFloat/toBoolean etc in preproc and PApplet
X error if you try to hit export twice on a sketch (just make synch'd)
X   "C:/ProgramFiles/proce55ing/processing-0060/sketchbook/default/double_export_tesuble_export_test.java:1:625:7:2: Semantic Error: Unable to write file
X   "C:/ProgramFiles/proce55ing/processing-0060/sketchbook/default/double_export_tesuble_export_test.class"."

X   rectMode means rectPlacement
X     becomes a problem when strokeMode and strokeWidth are mixed
X   beginRect() beginLineLoop() et al. ?
X   go through examples to see if there's other annoying syntax
X   need some model for i/o that makes more sense
X     getting whole words from serial, network, and files
X     or buffers of specific length with a sync byte
o console -> should be using JEditTextArea not TextPane
o make new TextAreaDefaults class for the console
o figure out how to color lines for errors and non (since not syntax)
o set decent fonts (probably same as editor above), looks bad on mac
o sketches can't be named starting with numbers (D.YOO)
o   either provide an error message or explanation for this
o   or allow the sketch name to be separte from the class/folder names

o for title-clicking of sketch name, change to a btn
o   or somehow mark what it's going to do, rather than just doing it
o make PdeEditorStatus modal
o   problem on quit (using JOptionPane as a band-aid)
o   also a problem because user can use the ui while prompt is visible
o   needs proper blocking, the way Dialog.show() does
o   so that that status window can be used while quitting
o   (currently cannot because it quits before getting response)
o   tried to pop up a modal Dialog in exactly the same location
o     but couldn't remove the decoration from the window (jvm bug?)
o     because it just quit without finishing
X prefs need to have a default
X   otherwise old prefs and new p5 will cause trouble
X   actually, just need to make sure preferences.txt is up to date
X     load that before the other stuff
X     -> was already implemented like that
o fix the problem causing all the "couldn't delete" messages
o class naming from dan
o   If you name a class the same name as the sketch project, 
o   you get an error about contained classes with duplicate names 
o   when you try to export for web.
o quick fix inside PdeRuntime
o   if (loop == false) and (draw == false) then provide an error
o   so user knows that one or the other is needed


// notes on an implementation of a 'shape' class..
// as long as using an additional pde file...

..to still maintain rect() instead of g.rect()
..and the rest of the p5 features

// shape or "processing" means to add all kinds of methods like:
// public void point(float x, float y) {  g.point(x, y);  }
// and that the class 'implements' ShapeInterface..
//
shape class Something {

  void setup() {
    // not used, or called on first draw

    // but maybe required (even if behind the scenes) 
    // so that this can use "implements ShapeInterface"
  }

  void draw() {  // uses internal g. that's been set by parent
  }
}

in the .pde parent:

void loop() {
  shape(somethingInstance);
}

where the shape() method in BApplet looks like:

shape(ShapeInterface o) {
  o.graphics(this.g);  // has to be a method, since intf
  o.draw();
}

X run java mode when large 'data' folder is in use

X fixed bug with draw mode apps, they now run inside setup
X   width/height wasn't getting set during setup(), so window bad
X moving p5 prefs on mac into documents? or inside sketchbook?
X   Documents -> Processing -> preferences.txt
X   do the same for windows, with sketchbook as a subfolder

040716 evening
o don't exit p5 if platform is unknown
o "save as" needs to update the editorheader
X   couldn't replicate this
X MAJOR: make .pde files embed themselves into the main class
o readUntil() should do the proper thing if the data is not available
o   i.e. either return null, or block until it's available? -> ret null
X "paste" isn't setting the "modified" bit for PdeEditor
X   i.e. cut -> new file -> paste doesn't mark any as changed
X "include all chars" and all the bugs it represents
X working on datatype conversions

040717 
o dll and jnilib files have to be in the p5 folder (confirmed by amit)

040902
X building Processing from scratch 
X   not able to write "preferences.txt" on the first run 

040903
X examples should be in a submenu of open

X "add library" menu item and submenu
X   looks for subfolder called 'libraries' inside p5 folder
X   libraries are determined by having a subfolder named 'library'

X   maybe ignore classes not inside the p5 libs dir?
o   need to be able to select between which to include
o   auto-resolve by saying java.* wins, others ask
X make built-in libraries read-only

040912 
X several menu changes as discussed with casey 
X   (capitalization, export/export app, tools)
X add preference for showing library stuff

040913 morning
X figure out why user libraries not being added
X in lib mode, show internal libraries as part of the 'open' menu 
X make a note that p5 has to be restarted for libs
X import all libraries into classpath
X   all libs found during sketchbook build + all libs in libraries
X   this means sketchbook menu will need to be rebuilt after lib build
X   append the user's classpath to the end of that

040913 afternoon
X "Processing" folder not properly created on new install

040920
X add noLoop() to static mode apps

X add all imported libs to hash table of jars

040921 evening
X lots of work on libraries, figuring out PLibrary api
X   attachLibrary(new libsomething()) and attachLibrary("pitaru.Sonia");
o   final stop() for static shutdown of lib
X     no static init - make the library designers deal with it
X   stop() for individual items
X register pre() and post() calls
X   this would avoid having to patch BApplet
X register for setup() calls
X where do libraries for distribution go?
X   libraries subfolder of p5
X PLibrary lib = attach(new PClient());
X get export working again
X System.out isn't being heard from P* classes
X   errors inside those classes also causing weirdness
X   this might be a broader running as external app problem
X   errorMessage in PSerial/PClient/PServer are all using System.out

X split classes to BVideo and BMovie ? 
X don't force install of qtjava
X   this requires a separate version of bagel that doesn't use video
X   or a version that loads video dynamically. that kinda sucks.
o   maybe could even compile it in with jikes? (blech)
o hangs frequently on the mac (prolly a sync issue)
o   karsten's stuff has same problem
o   but the roger's video tracking does not
X   should be fixed with new synchronization stuff
X video.pixels don't seem to have high bytes set
X   so fill(video.pixels[blah]) doesn't work
X   test against 'pixels' example
X   this is ok.. modify get() for RGB images to set high bits
X make BVideo subclass BImage
o   make sure the high bits are getting set as opaque
X   get() now sets high bits, reference will explain PVideo.pixels[]

X if there's a bug in bagel, PdeRuntime.message() ignores it
X   just says "NullPointerException" but provides no info
X   now at least spews the exception 
X removed ugly white borders from ui on macosx java 1.3
X   is there anything better that can be done for osx java 1.3
X   setInsets() to zero or something?
X font.stringWidth -> font.width(char c) or width(String s) 
X removed extra push()/pop() in text(String s) that may save time

X screenGrab() shouldn't allocate a new pixel buffer
X   just write things out directly
X   also fix for the new targa code
X added a note about needing forward slashes
X   In the config file, the sketchbook path works if you use forward
X   slashes, but not if you use unescaped backslashes.
X draw mode issues.. size and background must be int/float constants
X   might be a better 'mode' for bagel so bkg and size cmds work
X   rather than app being enclosed in beginFrame/endFrame loop
X modify background() to actually clear the screen
X   modify readme.txt regarding background() requiring constants
X remove notes from reference about size/background
X remove notes from readme about size/background
X change the naming of the two versions of calc_color
X The web page for ellipse (reference/ellipse_.html) talks about
X   rectangles in the parameter list instead of ellipses.
X resize() name is bad because it overrides component..
X   resize is maybe goofy, so just size() for all?
X color() with alpha now works properly
X removed SMOOTH_IMAGES
X removed shearX and shearY
X toxi image code (!) 
X   need background(BImage) and scaling, copy area, etc.
X vertex(x, y, u, v) and vertex(x, y, z, u, v)
X don't cast color()
X   since more important for color(v1, v2, v3) to work
X getPixel/setPixel -> get/set.. 
X   get(x, y, w, h) is nice but no set(x,y,w,h)
X   though set(x,y,w,h) could be nice

X resize should call background again to set color
X   if background was set before the resize
X   and the background is not an image (or should it just stretch?)
X     no need for image, since it has to be same size
X     and is only explicitly drawn when background() is called
X BGraphics subclasses BImage
X   inherits all image manipulation and image use methods
X background(BImage)
X   also creating background image inside setup()
X images drawn from center don't work for simage()
X   currently calling slower image routine
o make zbuffer available instead of g.zbuffer
o shape.. non-homogenous colors for beginShape()
o   currently disabled b/c homogenousColors not set false for vertices
X should image(img, x, y, alpha) work instead of using fill?

running 1.4 from the command line:
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.1/Commands/java 
Info.plist, setting JVMVersion
* 1.3.1 - only use JDK 1.3.1, even if later versions are available. 
* 1.3* - use any version of JDK 1.3.x. Do not use JDK 1.4 even if it's dflt.
* 1.3+ - use the latest JDK version from JDK 1.3 onward, up to default JDK. 
* 1.4+ - use JDK 1.4 or later, even if an earlier JDK is the default. 
o and then edit Info.plist to include the following lines:
o <key>JVMVersion</key> <string>1.3.1</string>

TODO CLEANUP
o online signup cgi for people to add themselves to the list
o probably should doClose() on new/open instead of doStop()
o option to delete current project (trickier)
o   also needs to have method for verify.. blech
o check logs to see where we're getting traffic from
o option to toggle console on/off (not just in properties, but realtime)
o look into using serialporteventlistener for simpleserial
o   may help with problems due to threading/synchronizing
o font usage/substition solution
o   write code to bind/convert java fonts
o     best would be freetype or jdk 1.3/1.4
o   java freetype? jni freetype to build texmap fonts?
o   look at flash file format? (does it have kerning?)
o may want to throw exceptions from bagel
o   but catch them inside bapplet--as part of making things easier
o file i/o utility classes
o   read as set of lines, read as cells in grid, read num sequence
o   then methods for writing all of the same
o stop() method in applet should stop kjc environment
o   should be able to call stop() to 'quit' an applet
X make versions available w/o fonts and jre
o moving sketchbook folder for lab environments
o adding lights
o   control of position/color of default lights
o controlling camera movements
o   mcguffin sent some notes about this
o multmatrix/identity
o constants besides PI, TWO_PI
o min/max with 3 parameters
o if (a) ? 3 : 4
o formatting printf-style things
o audio input
o audio synthesis
X stringutils.split is a useful one
X readFileLines et al
o translateMiddle() ? to move to the middle of the screen?
o perlin noise function
o delayUntil would be nice to have
o   but at some point there has to be a cutoff
o   have a library of useful code that people can add to programs
o   otherwise things are too simple, and env is a crutch
o example: multi-user server app (shared whiteboard)
o example: basic network app
o bug in sun vm for freaking out
o   also happened with ibm vm.. grr.. (or was it a path problem?)
X is it necessary to have fullscreen option on toolbar anymore?
o what's better than POLYGON_CONVEX and POLYGON_CONCAVE?
o should we use jdk 1.3 or msft vm?

X reported by fdb and brendanberg
After creating about 27 sketches, proce55ing (0046 on OS X) no longer would startup, giving me the following error:

Removing all sketches would solve the problem. 
/ lots of problems in moving sketches over
 i managed to run p5 from the applications folder once, but i think when i moved my sketches over from 0044 it broke: "uncaught exception in main method: java.lang.NullPointerException" 
 i tried reinstalling and running 'java -cp lib:lib/build: ...' and it worked fine (and would open from the icon afterwards) 
again, after i moved my sketches over it broke permanently... 
/ 46 dies when run from desktop on some machines [jes]

X undo/redo can go to far
X docs
X   make a note that size() has to come first [nluken]
X   look at the code that's created in build/
X known issues
X   random freezes.. especially under windows
X   wheel mouse is gone again, to return later
X describe rundown of constants pulled from pde.properties
X   coloring for syntax
X   sketchbook.path, very preliminary, still creates 'default'
X macos9 stuff
X   check to see if swing is working properly
X   get new release out, remove 1.3 specific stuff from textpane
X get syntax coloring debugged?
X   talk to casey about better default colors
X scroll to beginning after setText()
X color not set for default text area with empty text
X   color not set on 'new', setForeground won't do it
X   probably reasonably simple fix, but not in time
X undo/redo
X   should enable/disable as available
X   undo-ing too much will empty the text area
X     the setText is an undoable thing. grr.
X method to set a folder for the sketchbook
X when trying to use serial, provide error if things not installed


0046 
X install new swing-based textarea with syntax highlighting
X   improve the flicker problems (re-enable backing store?)
X   set better defaults for coloring
X   implement edit menu
X   implement undo/redo
X   re-implement sketchModified
X these boxes overlap but shouldn't:
X   may be simple <= instead of <, leftover from dbn
int thick = 36;
size(200, 200);
background(0);
noStroke();
fill(153, 163, 0.0);
rect(80, 0, thick, height/2);
fill(102, 112, 0.0);
rect(100, height/2, thick, height/2);
X re-implement sketchModified yet again (using keylistener)
X set font on textarea in case things break
X need examples to work for submenus (casey's got too many)
X why is javax.comm included a zillion times in exported .java file?
X fix issues with new swing-based text area
X   auto indent on next line no longer works
X   tabs no longer convert to 2 spaces
o   balance parens is no longer available
X problem with axel's strings example [might be related to long lines]
X   freezing problem, compiler was crashing and spewing bad message
X move build directory to root in cvs (on server)
X   and update scripts accordingly
X should java 1.3 classes be included in the imports
X   but not for exported applets? (might create some confusion)
X   included java audio classes for 1.3
X   included xml classes for 1.4
X pmouseX should be set at the end of loop(), not on mouse movement
X allow 3d curves
X   curveVertex and bezierVertex that take 3 args
X   3d versions of bezier() and curve()
X preprocessor tweaks
X   "http://acg.media.mit.edu" doesn't work because of //
X   "color.jpg" -> "int.jpg" causes trouble
X why does this line cause an error?
// String url = "http:\u002f\u002fwww.Proce55ing.net"; 
X   it's not in the preprocessor, but kopi seems to be having trouble
X seems that file i/o may be picking up lots of extra \r 
X   perhaps when doing setText, it's goobering things up
X when renaming a sketch, select the text in the field, 
X   so you can type the new name immediately. 
X added 'rename' command
X   also the default for clicking on the sketch's title
o   option to rename when doing a 'save as' (remove old files)
X remove .class files on save as [dimitre]
X   remove .jar, .class, and .java files from the 'applet' dir
When I am working in a project and I save it with another name, 
all the old files are copyied to new directory, and some of the old 
unused .class files and images remains inside new project JAR files. 
X serial port
X   better message for PortInUseException (full explanation)
X   better message for when serial port code not available/not installed
X set frame title of launched window to the name of the sketch
X fixed history bug where first history made would crash
X   this was previous unknown, but likely several found it (!)
X macosx - check to see if swing is working properly
X macosx - update build script to work with new layout
X Add an Edit menu containing Undo/Redo/Cut/Copy/Paste/Select
  All. It's standard Mac behaviour. 
X long list from frederik (fdb)
X If the cursor is at the last character of the last line of the 
  text area, moving the cursor up or down using the arrow keys throws 
  the following exception: 
  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
    at PdeEditorListener.keyPressed(PdeEditorListener.java:86) 
    at java.awt.Component.processKeyEvent(Component.java:3673) 
X If the cursor is at the last character of the first line of the text
  area, moving the cursor up using the arrow keys throws the same
  exception. However, moving the cursor down doesn't throw one.  
X Double-clicking a word doesn't select it, but the character after
  it. (however, sometimes the behaviour is correct) 
X Scrolling action when using cursor keys is not consistent with other
  editors: The window should only scroll when it needs to; it now tries
  to keep the cursor on the current line. (or one line below it) 
X Using Apple-shift-arrowLeft to select from the cursor pos to the
  beginning of the line, selects one character too little at the right
  side. Apple-shift-arrowRight has the same issue (selects one char too
  little at the left side). 
X Using Apple-shift-arrowDown selects only from the beginning of this
  line to the end of the following line. It doesn't extend the
  selection when pressed twice. It also selects the line under the
  current line. 
X Pressing the tab key moves to the bottom of the text area.
X hopefully fixed, but needs to be tested
? Select All (Apple-A) closes the application 
  (Ctrl-Q) on Azerty-keyboards 
X use date in the sketch name sketch_021104 
X   with a _2 if needed or '021104a' '021104b' etc
X   when using save as, allow to remove the old (numbered) sketch
X better default size than 300x300 when starting up first time
X bug report from the site
resizing the editor window in Mac OS X leaves the status bar in
place. The result is an editor window with a grey bar layered on top,
obscuring the editable text. 
X fix default fonts, font size on mac
X fix lots of annoying crap about highlighting lines on errors
X re-enable console, add synchronized (hrmph)
X added extra code for testing to for serial under osx
X   also suppressed error text in console for exception-less fail
X couldn't quit p5 when installed into a dir with spaces
X   properties were saved to a urlencoded place, %20 was causing trouble
X update dist script for new layout
X   put mac rxtx inside the p5 folder (hide it?)
X     include more strongly worded message about rxtx
X macos9: update build/dist scripts to work with new layout

X organizing directories, save to other directories blows up
X   for now, disallow the / or : characters
X   there was a bug that required a noop() b/c of jikes or 1.3 problems
X is problem w/ beautify that it has no menu event handler?
X   write event handler, and make sure it doesn't work for external ed
X don't popup offscreen if editor window is way left. 
X   just make sure the x coord > 10 or so (if not presenting)
X     if so, pop up window 50, 50 from upper left corner
X   if it still won't fit, center the window on screen
X don't throw exceptions for serial on startup if no serial available?
o   gets upset on osx if rxtx not installed during menu building
X   actually, it just throws UnsatisfiedLinkError

X   file names with a space get "_ " instead of a space ?
X   under osx, consuming event doesn't work, so don't do it real time
X sketch window resizing strangely
X   can make width/height larger, but only height smaller
X   check apple site for technote/bug listing
X     jes grabbed examples for me
X   getMinimumSize() on textarea is probably causing trouble
X     better just to pre-empt it on the frame, b/c textarea didn't do much
X apple-a for select all tries to quit
X   can't reproduce
X escape on presentation mode--no key events seem to be coming through
X make default font size for editor the next size smaller

o   export could be three circles in a row, overlapping
X everything is a project.. what about short snippets of code?
X   this version won't be able to access everything from scrapbook
X   (that requires a more robust class loader)
X sketch.properties contains the last program run
X   also the window positions, etc
X   saves screen size, so if screen size changed, window pos reset
X   if it doesn't exist, starts with a new project
X     for a new project, name it untitled-0001 or as appropriate
X       so that previous projects aren't written over
X verify save when
X   closing p5 window
X   moving to other sketch
X NullPointerException on startup in pde editor buttons
X   shows up on slower machines, probably images not loaded yet
X use a vm that won't destroy the screen like sun/ibm does
X   this means msft or newer version of jdk
X if default user, don't show the 'user' string in pde window
X item in pde.properties to set the name of the current user
X exporting
X   exporting applets that have custom name problems:
X     if extends processingapplet, the name user types must be same
X     gets confused about paths and puts boogers in weird places
X     doesn't compile correctly (must first compile with play)
X     doesn't include additional (private) classes
X   when exporting 'name of folder for export...'
X     default name should be from public class <xxxx>
X     because otherwise errors are happening
X     or name from user only determines folder name
X       if extends ProcessingApplet [more compatible]
X   make sure export is compiling first
X     right now have to hit play and then hit export (?)
X file structure for export
X   need to set project name for files
X   include other .class files built besides the main one
X     compile into 'classes' folder
X   include referenced image and font files (can't do if numbered)
X make close() work to kill applet in kjc
X save window x, y, width, height to pde.properties on exit
X stderr in red color
X 'data' directory for all media
X   make included media part of the .jar file 
X   it's really a pain to use external files in processing
X     getStream sucks (zach rewrote)
X     should be able to work for application or applets
X     may want to use getResource() (to get things from .jar files)
X remove .java and .class files for compiled classes
X   (just clean up the boogers afterwards)
X compiling .java files leaves the .class files next to the .java
X   make sure all the dirs in sketchbook added to classpath on startup
o   if new dir added, must restart processing (this is acceptable)
X importing images doesn't work (?)
0032a
X put 'modified' indicator in the darker color
X fix bug with opening sketches from the menu (grr)
X need to check if file.exists() when opening
X   otherwise the exception doesn't get caught and app hangs
X switch to using a 'build' directory in lib for everything
X   lib\build can be added to the classpath at startup
X   cleanout build directory on each run (delete .class/.java)
X   temporary until classloader issues worked out
X implement popup menu
0032b
X add 'new' button (and complete ui)
X make toolbars work with sk
X make 'data' dir work with build
X   empty contents and change bagel to use getResource
X   also use getResource("data" + )
X make export work again
0032c
X getData -> gets contents of stream, puts into byte array
X remove everything from build when starting a new build
X   (don't do this until it's clear that it's working well!)


0031
X lib/pde.properties should be read using getResource
X   otherwise path issues cause trouble (likely under win98)
X take state information out of Header
X cleanup lastFile/lastDirectory
X save (just) last program run in sketch.properties
X coloring of error, message, etc changed in pde.properties
X finish save changes stuff
X editorlistener shouldn't track menu commands as changes to file
X   ctrl keys bksp/del/enter/return/tab then space on up
X   indicator for changes?
X   need to implement code for whether changes have been made
X   check for key events in textarea or something
X     if key events, compare contents against the existing file
X userName not getting set before sketchbook menu is built
X add 'refresh list' item to the sketchbook menu
X ability to set directory for compiling in kjcengine
X make sure compiling into build directory
X   and once compiled there, read all classes for export
X write class loader or figure out how to change classpath
X   might be able to load classes using forInstance on each file
X   using byte array version of constructor
X you should be able to create methods in drawing mode
X   this shouldn't work, make void draw() {} to allow


0030
X attempt to fold serial into bapplet, but mostly fail
X   convert color -> int
X     also include #ff00cc -> proper conversion
X   comments are removed from exported files


0029
X triangle() 6 parameters
X quad() 8 parameters
X rect/rectMode again
X remove addMouse/addKeyboard/addTime
X keyDown(), mouseDown(), lastMouseX, lastMouseY
X degrees(), radians()
X new color solution
X   make sure fxns come through (if static/final?)
X   color() -> uses colorMode
X   red/green/blue() hue/saturation/value() functions
X   getPixel/setPixel
X proposed color solution (canned)
o   color -> since color 'mode', responds to colorMode
o   getPixel/setPixel -> get/set int for purpose of moving pixels
o   get/set Red/Green/Blue/Hue/Saturation/Brightness -> uses colorMode
o   setColor(x, y, z) -> hsb or rgb via colorMode
X get casey setup with full cvs so that he can build w/ changes
X make sure lib/export is updated properly this time


0028
X modified pde.properties slightly for console and header
X need stdout in p5 window b/c mac has no stdout
X   remove class 'PdeEditorOutput' and 'PdeEditorLabel'(?)
X   added editor.console.lines to pde.properties
X int() and float() now work for casting
X draw mode needs to be better for workshops
X   make size() work for draw() mode
X     inside Engine, reach in and grab calls to 'size'
X     if call is not using a constant number, then punt
X   when exporting, needs to grab this size parameter as well
o related classes
X   resolved, just use inner classes for everything
o   better way to do parent and g.rect stuff in related classes
o     implement g. passed into any function called draw()
o     also important for things like cos, sin, max etc
o     but maybe once you're doing more advanced code, that stuff's ok
o       or using inner classes is better b/c class stuff works
o   related classes also need to implement pConstants
X fixed annoying findSelection bug spew on startup
X (fixed) 0.4f no longer allowed in the code
X size() code no longer checks for resize() and other similar things
X add char(), byte() to int/float stuff
X put jre into 'java' folder, include win32comm
X finish tweaks to folder layout in distribution ('java' subdir)
X   move p5 stuff out of lib so that dir can be moved more easily
X   maybe put bin/lib inside 'jre' folder and keep lib for p5
X   for people that want the space, they could remove 'jre'
X   will make much simpler to update
X serial is probably broken in newer versions b/c of 1.3
X   fixed, only win32comm was missing from dll dir


0027
X change editor.button_bgcolor -> editor.buttons.bgcolor
X if no 0 before decimal place in a number it breaks
X change plane to quad
X get new casey colors and buttons


0025
X change 'rect' to 'plane' (point/line/plane)
X   also rectMode to planeMode
X change QUADS to PLANES, QUAD_STRIP to PLANE_STRIP
X delay wasn't working for casey
X   works fine on pc.. maybe a mac problem
X   turned out to be a misunderstanding for loop()
X curve and bezier behave differently for indexing points
X   change bezier to act the same (each addl point)
X allow ui to be colored/skinned so creas can tweak
X make macintosh release
X   font file names are getting mangled on mac (too long)
X   new set of fonts, make sure the names are ok


0024 
X bug fixes (lighting was broken)


0023
X not released, tweaks and bug fixes in paris hotel


0022
X not released, just working on tweaks and bug fixes


0021
X cosmetic ui update so that it's not so dbn-like
X   should this instead be simple colors update (no placement)
X move everything to new bagel api names
X having to put 'f' after everything is a mess
X   included oro matcher, no need to use anymore :)


0020
o fix bugs from the 'bugs' file
o   then remove the file from cvs
o   if fill(), need to draw several non-stroked planes
o   if stroke(), then draw single lines for each edge
o     do not duplicate edges for lines
o also problem filling on beginShape() triangle stuff
X z coordinates are backwards from gl (at least from mazo)
X   looked into it, this doesn't appear to be the case..
X   how did this happen? what's the appropriate way to fix?
X   in gl, positive z goes into the screen 
X   may be able to do a scale(0, 0, -1) that doesn't affect dims
X     then when dims set to 3, will fix the z coords
X   this will also affect zbuffer ordering
X if BagelImage doesn't load, then image() calls arrayindexoutofbounds
X   better solution for this (error while opening image)
X get rid of 'kill' button
X int version of min and abs
X introduce pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pConstants (pSound)


0019
questions answered..
X is day, month, year overkill inside processingapplet? 
X   decided no
X loadImage or getImage? 
X   loadImage sounds better to ben and casey
X circle/square functions
X   doesn't seem necessary
X   main problem is that with ellipse, points aren't inside shape
X should the default be 100x100
X   yes, casey won
X default background color: 204
X   casey prevails again
X maybe stop/kill button should only be a stop btn - yes
X what to call 'pouch' directory? -- data
X function name to toggle drawing from center: ellipseMode(), rectMode()
X PImage, PFont or how to name?
X   pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pSound
X bezierVertex/catmullRomVertex poorly named (based on algo used)
X   instead curveVertex/fitCurveVertex/etc.
X   use curveVertex and bezierVertex
bagel miscellaneous
X change lightsOn/lightsOff to lights() and noLights()
X beginShape() defaults to POLYGON
X   introduce constants for other poly modes
X add ellipseMode(), rectMode()
X   CENTER_RADIUS, CENTER_DIAMETER, CORNER, TWO_CORNERS
X bezier and catmullrom aren't setting ndim to at least two 
X   ?? not sure why they would
X translate(x, y) doesn't seem to affect a rect()
X   flat_rect was being used where ndim was 2, not 0
X curveVertex and bezierVertex instead of catmull/bezier crap
X single color function
X   need to clamp colors (nothing > 255 or < 0)
X     (garbage created when color values out of range)
X   do by simplifying stroke/fill/background inside bagel
X     these should be done w/ a switch (STROKE, FILL, BK, OTHER)
X     needs to be done inside cpp version too.. minimize amt of code
X   rewrite fill/stroke/etc to use same code
X     doesn't need to be super fast, so the extra assigns no big deal
X move MemoryImageSource out of bagel and into ProcessingApplet
X   need to run bagel to just render to a large internal buffer
X   this fits better with the c++ model of things
X make default size be 100x100
X make default background color 204
X lightsOff() seems dumb with noStroke and noFill
X   lights() and noLights()


0018

X image(img, x, y) was broken for unwarped mode, disabled it


0010
X add java.* to top of processingapplet default base class used by kjc

X make acu fonts work again
X write code to use simple bitmap fonts
X add a file with bugs for testing

X   should shapes draw from center or from upper left?
X   should ovals use radius or diameter?
X   should shapes use x1, y1 - x2, y2 or x, y, w, h?
X nice to have a random number generator between -1..1 
X   as well as an integer random; instead of just 0..1
X show creas how to get access to cvs
X documentation says 'mouseDown' even though it's 'mousePressed'
X font support
X   use gzip to compress bitmaps (made 115k vlw font -> 16k)
X   loadImage/loadFont or getImage/getFont?
X   text(char c), text(string s)
X   current acu fonts are broken
X image support
X   image() and 2D/2D affine versions of it
X   no stroke should show up on image()
X   fill being set on image() produces weird results
X     has to be set, but doesn't actually affect color
X min() seems funny/unavailable
X   worked fine for me


0009
X bagel fixes
X   beginShape(POINTS) is not working, no marks are appearing 
X     this was a pain in the ass to fix
