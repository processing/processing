0034
X make all windows 120x120?
X   default program should be large, 300x200 or so
X   what if it's smaller? boundary of color 51, 51, 51 around it
X implement presentation mode
X   editor frame doesn't have to be in front
X     include button in present mode to bring editor back up
X add frame to launched window
X   add maximize event catcher to make fullscreen

0032
already finished
X need to update PdeKeyListener for new ui.. 
X   remove open, add d for duplicate, r for rename, others ?
X 'open' button is a switch-to button
X   pops up list of everything in the sketchbook
o   first item is 'new sketch', followed by delimeter
X   next is list of subdirs other than current user, then delim
X   the rest are the items in the current user's folder
X need 'new' button on the toolbar (or first sketch menuitem?)
o   the zero looking one might be good (instead of export)
o   export could be three circles in a row, overlapping
X everything is a project.. what about short snippets of code?
X   this version won't be able to access everything from scrapbook
X   (that requires a more robust class loader)
X sketch.properties contains the last program run
X   also the window positions, etc
X   saves screen size, so if screen size changed, window pos reset
X   if it doesn't exist, starts with a new project
X     for a new project, name it untitled-0001 or as appropriate
X       so that previous projects aren't written over
X verify save when
X   closing p5 window
X   moving to other sketch
X NullPointerException on startup in pde editor buttons
X   shows up on slower machines, probably images not loaded yet
X use a vm that won't destroy the screen like sun/ibm does
X   this means msft or newer version of jdk
X if default user, don't show the 'user' string in pde window
X item in pde.properties to set the name of the current user
X exporting
X   exporting applets that have custom name problems:
X     if extends processingapplet, the name user types must be same
X     gets confused about paths and puts boogers in weird places
X     doesn't compile correctly (must first compile with play)
X     doesn't include additional (private) classes
X   when exporting 'name of folder for export...'
X     default name should be from public class <xxxx>
X     because otherwise errors are happening
X     or name from user only determines folder name
X       if extends ProcessingApplet [more compatible]
X   make sure export is compiling first
X     right now have to hit play and then hit export (?)
X file structure for export
X   need to set project name for files
X   include other .class files built besides the main one
X     compile into 'classes' folder
X   include referenced image and font files (can't do if numbered)
X make close() work to kill applet in kjc
X save window x, y, width, height to pde.properties on exit
X stderr in red color
X 'data' directory for all media
X   make included media part of the .jar file 
X   it's really a pain to use external files in processing
X     getStream sucks (zach rewrote)
X     should be able to work for application or applets
X     may want to use getResource() (to get things from .jar files)
X remove .java and .class files for compiled classes
X   (just clean up the boogers afterwards)
X compiling .java files leaves the .class files next to the .java
X   make sure all the dirs in sketchbook added to classpath on startup
o   if new dir added, must restart processing (this is acceptable)
X importing images doesn't work (?)
0032a
X put 'modified' indicator in the darker color
X fix bug with opening sketches from the menu (grr)
X need to check if file.exists() when opening
X   otherwise the exception doesn't get caught and app hangs
X switch to using a 'build' directory in lib for everything
X   lib\build can be added to the classpath at startup
X   cleanout build directory on each run (delete .class/.java)
X   temporary until classloader issues worked out
X implement popup menu
0032b
X add 'new' button (and complete ui)
X make toolbars work with sk
X make 'data' dir work with build
X   empty contents and change bagel to use getResource
X   also use getResource("data" + )
X make export work again
0032c
X getData -> gets contents of stream, puts into byte array
X remove everything from build when starting a new build
X   (don't do this until it's clear that it's working well!)


0031
X lib/pde.properties should be read using getResource
X   otherwise path issues cause trouble (likely under win98)
X take state information out of Header
X cleanup lastFile/lastDirectory
X save (just) last program run in sketch.properties
X coloring of error, message, etc changed in pde.properties
X finish save changes stuff
X editorlistener shouldn't track menu commands as changes to file
X   ctrl keys bksp/del/enter/return/tab then space on up
X   indicator for changes?
X   need to implement code for whether changes have been made
X   check for key events in textarea or something
X     if key events, compare contents against the existing file
X userName not getting set before sketchbook menu is built
X add 'refresh list' item to the sketchbook menu
X ability to set directory for compiling in kjcengine
X make sure compiling into build directory
X   and once compiled there, read all classes for export
X write class loader or figure out how to change classpath
X   might be able to load classes using forInstance on each file
X   using byte array version of constructor
X you should be able to create methods in drawing mode
X   this shouldn't work, make void draw() {} to allow


0030
X attempt to fold serial into bapplet, but mostly fail
X   convert color -> int
X     also include #ff00cc -> proper conversion
X   comments are removed from exported files


0029

X remove addMouse/addKeyboard/addTime
X keyDown(), mouseDown(), lastMouseX, lastMouseY
X degrees(), radians()
X new color solution
X   make sure fxns come through (if static/final?)
X   color() -> uses colorMode
X   red/green/blue() hue/saturation/value() functions
X   getPixel/setPixel
X proposed color solution (canned)
o   color -> since color 'mode', responds to colorMode
o   getPixel/setPixel -> get/set int for purpose of moving pixels
o   get/set Red/Green/Blue/Hue/Saturation/Brightness -> uses colorMode
o   setColor(x, y, z) -> hsb or rgb via colorMode
X get casey setup with full cvs so that he can build w/ changes
X make sure lib/export is updated properly this time


0028
X modified pde.properties slightly for console and header
X need stdout in p5 window b/c mac has no stdout
X   remove class 'PdeEditorOutput' and 'PdeEditorLabel'(?)
X   added editor.console.lines to pde.properties
X int() and float() now work for casting
X draw mode needs to be better for workshops
X   make size() work for draw() mode
X     inside Engine, reach in and grab calls to 'size'
X     if call is not using a constant number, then punt
X   when exporting, needs to grab this size parameter as well
o related classes
X   resolved, just use inner classes for everything
o   better way to do parent and g.rect stuff in related classes
o     implement g. passed into any function called draw()
o     also important for things like cos, sin, max etc
o     but maybe once you're doing more advanced code, that stuff's ok
o       or using inner classes is better b/c class stuff works
o   related classes also need to implement pConstants
X fixed annoying findSelection bug spew on startup
X (fixed) 0.4f no longer allowed in the code
X size() code no longer checks for resize() and other similar things
X add char(), byte() to int/float stuff
X put jre into 'java' folder, include win32comm
X finish tweaks to folder layout in distribution ('java' subdir)
X   move p5 stuff out of lib so that dir can be moved more easily
X   maybe put bin/lib inside 'jre' folder and keep lib for p5
X   for people that want the space, they could remove 'jre'
X   will make much simpler to update
X serial is probably broken in newer versions b/c of 1.3
X   fixed, only win32comm was missing from dll dir


0027
X change editor.button_bgcolor -> editor.buttons.bgcolor
X if no 0 before decimal place in a number it breaks
X change plane to quad
X get new casey colors and buttons


0025
X change 'rect' to 'plane' (point/line/plane)
X   also rectMode to planeMode
X change QUADS to PLANES, QUAD_STRIP to PLANE_STRIP
X delay wasn't working for casey
X   works fine on pc.. maybe a mac problem
X   turned out to be a misunderstanding for loop()
X curve and bezier behave differently for indexing points
X   change bezier to act the same (each addl point)
X allow ui to be colored/skinned so creas can tweak
X make macintosh release
X   font file names are getting mangled on mac (too long)
X   new set of fonts, make sure the names are ok


0024 
X bug fixes (lighting was broken)


0023
X not released, tweaks and bug fixes in paris hotel


0022
X not released, just working on tweaks and bug fixes


0021
X cosmetic ui update so that it's not so dbn-like
X   should this instead be simple colors update (no placement)
X move everything to new bagel api names
X having to put 'f' after everything is a mess
X   included oro matcher, no need to use anymore :)


0020
o fix bugs from the 'bugs' file
o   then remove the file from cvs
o   if fill(), need to draw several non-stroked planes
o   if stroke(), then draw single lines for each edge
o     do not duplicate edges for lines
o also problem filling on beginShape() triangle stuff
X z coordinates are backwards from gl (at least from mazo)
X   looked into it, this doesn't appear to be the case..
X   how did this happen? what's the appropriate way to fix?
X   in gl, positive z goes into the screen 
X   may be able to do a scale(0, 0, -1) that doesn't affect dims
X     then when dims set to 3, will fix the z coords
X   this will also affect zbuffer ordering
X if BagelImage doesn't load, then image() calls arrayindexoutofbounds
X   better solution for this (error while opening image)
X get rid of 'kill' button
X int version of min and abs
X introduce pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pConstants (pSound)


0019
questions answered..
X is day, month, year overkill inside processingapplet? 
X   decided no
X loadImage or getImage? 
X   loadImage sounds better to ben and casey
X circle/square functions
X   doesn't seem necessary
X   main problem is that with ellipse, points aren't inside shape
X should the default be 100x100
X   yes, casey won
X default background color: 204
X   casey prevails again
X maybe stop/kill button should only be a stop btn - yes
X what to call 'pouch' directory? -- data
X function name to toggle drawing from center: ellipseMode(), rectMode()
X PImage, PFont or how to name?
X   pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pSound
X bezierVertex/catmullRomVertex poorly named (based on algo used)
X   instead curveVertex/fitCurveVertex/etc.
X   use curveVertex and bezierVertex
bagel miscellaneous
X change lightsOn/lightsOff to lights() and noLights()
X beginShape() defaults to POLYGON
X   introduce constants for other poly modes
X add ellipseMode(), rectMode()
X   CENTER_RADIUS, CENTER_DIAMETER, CORNER, TWO_CORNERS
X bezier and catmullrom aren't setting ndim to at least two 
X   ?? not sure why they would
X translate(x, y) doesn't seem to affect a rect()
X   flat_rect was being used where ndim was 2, not 0
X curveVertex and bezierVertex instead of catmull/bezier crap
X single color function
X   need to clamp colors (nothing > 255 or < 0)
X     (garbage created when color values out of range)
X   do by simplifying stroke/fill/background inside bagel
X     these should be done w/ a switch (STROKE, FILL, BK, OTHER)
X     needs to be done inside cpp version too.. minimize amt of code
X   rewrite fill/stroke/etc to use same code
X     doesn't need to be super fast, so the extra assigns no big deal
X move MemoryImageSource out of bagel and into ProcessingApplet
X   need to run bagel to just render to a large internal buffer
X   this fits better with the c++ model of things
X make default size be 100x100
X make default background color 204
X lightsOff() seems dumb with noStroke and noFill
X   lights() and noLights()

X     has to be set, but doesn't actually affect color
X min() seems funny/unavailable
X   worked fine for me
