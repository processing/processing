X bug fixes (lighting was broken)


0023
X not released, tweaks and bug fixes in paris hotel


0022
X not released, just working on tweaks and bug fixes


0021
X cosmetic ui update so that it's not so dbn-like
X   should this instead be simple colors update (no placement)
X move everything to new bagel api names
X having to put 'f' after everything is a mess
X   included oro matcher, no need to use anymore :)


0020
o fix bugs from the 'bugs' file
o   then remove the file from cvs
o   if fill(), need to draw several non-stroked planes
o   if stroke(), then draw single lines for each edge
o     do not duplicate edges for lines
o also problem filling on beginShape() triangle stuff
X z coordinates are backwards from gl (at least from mazo)
X   looked into it, this doesn't appear to be the case..
X   how did this happen? what's the appropriate way to fix?
X   in gl, positive z goes into the screen 
X   may be able to do a scale(0, 0, -1) that doesn't affect dims
X     then when dims set to 3, will fix the z coords
X   this will also affect zbuffer ordering
X if BagelImage doesn't load, then image() calls arrayindexoutofbounds
X   better solution for this (error while opening image)
X get rid of 'kill' button
X int version of min and abs
X introduce pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pConstants (pSound)


0019
questions answered..
X is day, month, year overkill inside processingapplet? 
X   decided no
X loadImage or getImage? 
X   loadImage sounds better to ben and casey
X circle/square functions
X   doesn't seem necessary
X   main problem is that with ellipse, points aren't inside shape
X should the default be 100x100
X   yes, casey won
X default background color: 204
X   casey prevails again
X maybe stop/kill button should only be a stop btn - yes
X what to call 'pouch' directory? -- data
X function name to toggle drawing from center: ellipseMode(), rectMode()
X PImage, PFont or how to name?
X   pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pSound
X bezierVertex/catmullRomVertex poorly named (based on algo used)
X   instead curveVertex/fitCurveVertex/etc.
X   use curveVertex and bezierVertex
bagel miscellaneous
X change lightsOn/lightsOff to lights() and noLights()
X beginShape() defaults to POLYGON
X   introduce constants for other poly modes
X add ellipseMode(), rectMode()
X   CENTER_RADIUS, CENTER_DIAMETER, CORNER, TWO_CORNERS
X bezier and catmullrom aren't setting ndim to at least two 
X   ?? not sure why they would
X translate(x, y) doesn't seem to affect a rect()
X   flat_rect was being used where ndim was 2, not 0
X curveVertex and bezierVertex instead of catmull/bezier crap
X single color function
X   need to clamp colors (nothing > 255 or < 0)
X     (garbage created when color values out of range)
X   do by simplifying stroke/fill/background inside bagel
X     these should be done w/ a switch (STROKE, FILL, BK, OTHER)
X     needs to be done inside cpp version too.. minimize amt of code
X   rewrite fill/stroke/etc to use same code
X     doesn't need to be super fast, so the extra assigns no big deal
X move MemoryImageSource out of bagel and into ProcessingApplet
X   need to run bagel to just render to a large internal buffer
X   this fits better with the c++ model of things
X make default size be 100x100
X make default background color 204
X lightsOff() seems dumb with noStroke and noFill
X   lights() and noLights()


0018
X fix fonts.. try megan's color selector applet


0017 improve exporting and lines
X g.applet = this at beginning of program
X finish setFont with a font size
X add 'hint' function for scaling line thickness
X add hint for super smooth images
X add preferredsize to processingapplet
X bug in Bagel.loadImage that made images not work in applets
X catch exception inside polygon scanner (slower?)

0014
X fix z coordinate, ndims not being set to 3 
X put bezierCurve and catmullRomCurve back in
X examples - setting background using a full screen image
X   uses System.arraycopy for speed
X update to newer version of kjc (1.5B)
X move website to cvs
X   make fake cvs user that creas and i can share passwd of
X unwarped_image() is broken (making things slow for jseo)
X   then fix in c++ version
X special case lines of thickness 1
X   doing way too much work to draw thin lines
X   using full 3D polygon fella for semi-obviously 1 pixel lines
X may have fixed OutOfMemoryError problems
X   run.bat had included -ms256m -mx256m


0013 
X ellipse draws in the opposite direction of the origin
X actually fix the bug with extends
X   wasn't included in previous release
X option to set full screen background color
X   uses fullscreen.bgcolor in lib/pde.properties
X remove 'colorScale' from the default program in pde
X fix color cube applet 
X   make it run in current version of processing
X   fix background from showing up black
X screenGrab() code (single frame to tif)
X externally loaded files are off by 1 line for errors


0012
X 'extends' replacement is mangling things.. fix it


0011
X image(img, x, y) was broken for unwarped mode, disabled it


0010
X add java.* to top of processingapplet default base class used by kjc
X KjcProcessingApplet is dumb, kjc should make subst itself
o   give warning when compiling w/o kjcprocessingapplet
X random bug with an extra line being added in beginner mode
X   (threw off error markings)
X z=0 shit, 2D stuff needs to draw over z=0 plane
X   new objects draw behind old objects with noBackground()
X fix crappy way of determining if inside a class--ignores comments
X   hope this fis works.. not tested much
X make acu fonts work again
X write code to use simple bitmap fonts
X add a file with bugs for testing
X kjc not smart enough to just compile things that are in classpath
X redo random functions in processing applet
X strangeness with stroke when a rect goes off outside the window
X rect now uses x, y, width, height instead of x1, y1, x2, y2
X circle has been replaced with ellipse (uses xywh)
X box takes diameter, or width, height, depth [NOT IN CPP]
X sphere is the same as box [NOT IN CPP]
X got rid of colorscale and using colormode for all instead
X   make changes in documentation
X 'ellipse' instead of 'oval'?
X   make note in documentation
X catmullrom is broken 
X   write documentation for new curve functions
o make note in docs about removal of LINE from LINES
X setting origins
X   should shapes draw from center or from upper left?
X   should ovals use radius or diameter?
X   should shapes use x1, y1 - x2, y2 or x, y, w, h?
X nice to have a random number generator between -1..1 
X   as well as an integer random; instead of just 0..1
X show creas how to get access to cvs
X documentation says 'mouseDown' even though it's 'mousePressed'
X font support
X   use gzip to compress bitmaps (made 115k vlw font -> 16k)
X   loadImage/loadFont or getImage/getFont?
X   text(char c), text(string s)
X   current acu fonts are broken
X image support
X   image() and 2D/2D affine versions of it
X   no stroke should show up on image()
X   fill being set on image() produces weird results
X     has to be set, but doesn't actually affect color
X min() seems funny/unavailable
X   worked fine for me


0009
X bagel fixes
X   beginShape(POINTS) is not working, no marks are appearing 
X     this was a pain in the ass to fix
X   beginShape(LINE_LOOP) is not looping around

X   leave the others turned on, but parens off by default
X enable/disable full screen leaves windows in back
X   (may just require two toFront() calls)
X   whenever background is frontmost, have it call tofront on editor

0006
X get serial i/o code working in processing
X   how to kill serial when applet stopped
X     finalizer prolly not getting called


0005
X running out of memory, presumably b/c applets not being cleared
X   happens inside init() of applet (at new Bagel())
X   figure out why threads aren't actually dying
X   disassociate processing applet with a window on stop?
X   possible to maintain bagel, but kill applet?

0001
X convert documentation to html
o setup imrf linux machine?


DISCARD
o get proce55ing.net, make that the target launch site
