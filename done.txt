X   instead of semibold, which wouldn't correctly connect to the other fonts
X does editor line status work?
X   not sure what this one was, but added anti-aliasing to the status

cleaning/earlier
X common error messages
X   with a proper list, we can add links when throwing an error in the PDE
X   Dan started this on the Wiki
o build is currently broken for fresh checkout due to changes to file layout
o   something that gets fixed by 'make clean'
o   also test on windows and linux
o add a check to make sure that people aren't running from the dmg
o   doesn't actually cause any problems, so don't bother?
o code to hide menubar.. just include JNA and call from there?
NSMenu.setMenubarVisible(false);
Then we used Cocoa via JNI:
if([NSMenu menuBarVisible]){
	[NSMenu setMenuBarVisible:NO];
}
You can't do that from the AWT event thread. You need to do a -performSelectorOnMainThread to do that on the AppKit event thread.
Please see <http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2005/tn2147.html> for more information, particularly the section about "Calling AppKit from AWT/Swing".

manager
X change location of the manager download
X check to see if manager items from the download can be updated
X   oops, probably not, because they're part of the distribution
X   and folks won't be able to write to those directories
X changed manager to go to download.processing.org/latest.txt
X   and uses a redirect from there (hopeully that's followed?)

X remove "Compilations" category for libraries
X modes shouldn't have categories?
X   was counting "Unknown" as a category
X modes and tools require restart (per ContributionType class)
X   but no message is provided anywhere?

cleaning
X most of theme probably moves back into lib
o   editor.bgcolor probably moves out of the theme.txt file for the mode
o   or should it be a user preference thing
o   for that matter, need to decide on how much modes can customize themselves
X   make decision about where coloring is stored
o   needs to be reset for this release, maybe others

cleaning/libraries
o proper libraries warning dialog
o   check if libraries folder does not exist
o   check to see if other libraries are installed
X   warn user about moving libraries and restarting
X add "pretty menu name" to the export.txt file
o move export.txt to xml?
X   nah, it's only flat information
X tools -> get library
X   library url: [ http://blahblah.org/something ]
X   this would grab something.version, and something.zip
X   maybe something.xml that would include a bunch of background
X tools -> update libraries
X   this would check the something.version to see if it's newer
o document how to add libraries: put in sketchbook (not libraries folder)
o library/download.url and library/home.url
o if there's a reference subfolder, add that to the help menu
o   and enable it for "find in reference"
X     nice idea but too error-prone
o java.extension.dirs has the library/extn stuff
o   can probably set this blank
o   example from jsyn

o change mode handling so that XQMode works properly
X   decided to just replace ecj with jdt-core
o   move ecj.jar into the java mode folders
X   replace ecj.jar in the .exe, plist, sh, and the rest
X   replaced ecj.jar with org.eclipse.jdt.core_3.7.1.v_B76_R37x.jar
X   rationale
X     built-in modes don't bother with their own 'mode' folder and don't
X     currently use their own classloader. this could be changed, but as
X     it turns out, things like XQMode already *depend* on JavaMode, so
X     that would mean putting the .jar file for ecj into each of the modes
X     that subclass it. not a good solution, but no good solution for
X     library deps either. punting on that for now, and instead just deal
X     with this specific (more esoteric) low-level case w/ a workaround
X very slow startup on OS X (library manager et al?)

X   set -Djava.awt.headless=true
X   use as a way to remove the non-GUI-specifc code from PApplet
X   so that the builds can run headless
X could move to java6 and better internal javac support (drop ecj)
o   decided to use Java 6, so check on Javac usefulness
X change command line to just be part of regular (separate) distros
X   there's so much platform code in there, it's not worth the extra work
X   also include update check for logging
X command line support is currently broken
X   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=142
o   some fixes can be found in the bug report
o   need to deal with setting path to sketchbook/examples
o   also deal with the script not being in the right folder
X   lots of other fixes to deal with moving away from weird prefs split

o errors with serial and libraries
Exception in thread "Thread-2" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
processing/core/PApplet
    at processing.serial.Serial.<init>(Serial.java:156)
generally, that error means that something is missing from the
CLASSPATH. the NoClassDefError gives erroneous feedback about *what*
class is actually missing, as of java 1.3+ (yay!)
so perhaps conflicting versions of a library in the sketchbook (solve
this by setting to an empty sketchbook temporarily) or files might be
installed in the CLASSPATH variable or something conflicting in
/System/Library/Extensions.

X   Monaco can no longer be disabled
X modes have their own methods for digging through sketch & libraries folders
o   therefore it need only check the sketch.txt file to see if it's ok
o   (between android and java)
o   but more importantly, if it's something totally different (.py) then
o   that'll be ok, and work fine
o   need another extension for the p5 py stuff
X   seems that we're set on this?
o android mode will make no attempt to figure out which of your sketches are relevant... however you can add the sketch.txt file (sketch.properties?) to the directory if you want to be specific about it.

X   no longer needed with new OpenGL
o don't allow processing to run on snow leopard with 1.5
o test .java files on desktop version
o remove any reference to 'Editor' from Sketch.java
o   or is that excessive, since Document is in there, etc
o   Build does the heavy lifting anyway...
o the code[] array in Sketch is super hokey... switch to an arraylist
o   and add compare method to SketchCode so that it can be sorted by name
o can't rename a .pde file as a .java file

o how to grab the java2d object from PGraphics2D
o example for using mediatracker to load images
o   simple example for threaded image loading "load several"
o   (rather than blocking on each)
o   maybe add a loadImages(String files[]) function?
o   use a MediaTracker that's shared, so that while an image is still
o   loading, other calls to loadImage might be able to add things to the
o   queue. or maybe beginImage() and endImage()? or a mode that lets
o   you wait for the images to download (size is zero until they're ready)
o   MediaTracker blocking is prolly making jar download really slow

macosx launcher
X for the .app file, $APP_PACKAGE will give the path
X   $JAVAROOT will give Contents/Resources/Java location
X would be nice to have macosx packaged up as a single .app file
X   should recommend that people install libraries into their sketchbook


0148 pde
X clean up accessors inside Sketch and SketchCode
X   Editor, Sketch, and SketchCode are now fair game
X clean up Base a bit
X   public methods in Base are now also fair game
X remove hide/unhide code and menu options
X create a local version of javadoc, and send to server
X clean up some of the api naming for tab changes, etc.
X   setCurrentTab(int index or String filename)
X   getTabs() ? maybe these are interface to the code class
X   clean up API for JEditTextArea before exposing the object
X write basic documentation for how it's handled (tools/howto.txt)
X add tools folder to make and dist scripts


0147 pde
X inside Sketch.java, don't hardwire the file extension types
X   arduino uses .c, .cpp, .h instead of .java
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=807
X major changes to save/save as/rename setup - keep an eye out
X need to add local java folder to path on linux
X   otherwise if no linux installed, complaining that no java found
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=879

tools
X refactor code to use more getter/setter methods
X   move the debug classes back into processing.app.debug
X   this will help the library stuff
X dynamic tools menu (requires moving files around)
o   this means can integrate the autoformat stuff
X   processing.mess/tools has chandler's template stuff
o need to write converter that will handle syntax changes
o   convert from alpha to 1.0 syntax
o   framerate() -> frameRate()
o   basically find & replace with regexps
o   acts just like find/replace.. go through and do by hand
o   3 column input file
o   regexp to find, to replace, human readable description
o   (void\s+)loop(\s+{) -> $1draw$2 (maintain all whitespace stuff)
o   "The loop() method is now called draw() as of beta"
o   "angleMode no longer exists, use radians() around your angles"
o   (comment out the line)
X   this would only fix the minor stuff, not the important stuff
X   it also has a lot of potential problems and corner cases
X   just not worth the effort
X tools api
X   need to support the basic set of functions that are expected
X   to be used, otherwise it's gonna be total hell when we make a real api
X   getEditor()
X   get/setSelStart/End
X   get/setSelText
X   get/setText
X make dynamically loaded plugins and "tools" menu
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=124
X tools api:
X   init() -> run when p5 is first launched
o   isAvailable() -> true/false whether the option should be dimmed
X     skip this for now, not sending events to tools all the time
o   show() and hide() -> open the window or run the tool
o     is there a better name than show() since not all will be visible?
o     maybe it's just a run() method launched via invokeLater()?
X     can't really do show/hide from editor, make the tool handle this
o   getDefaultShortcut() -> returns the default shortcut this tools wants
o       store this in the data file instead
X       not bothering with this for now, since can't handle overlaps
X   needs to be able to get current sketch code
X   look at the pretty-formatting code to see what else needs to be in api
o   getMenu() -> return non-null the tool is a submenu
X       no, bad idea.. don't want a zillion submenus on things


0146 pde
X fix problem with comment/uncomment and indent/outdent
X   when no selection, and on the first pos of the line
X on comment/uncomment, need to check if *all* lines are commented
X   otherwise should be comment (never uncomment unless all selected)

runner
X use debugger to get better exceptions
X   and getting the error to show up in the window inside p5
X   also highlighting the correct line
X Exceptions not being reported properly to the PDE
X   lines with errors not highlighting
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=877
X   was ok in 0144, but 0145 things broke
X   probably b/c not catching ex inside the run() method
X getMessage() not sufficient for exceptions coming through
X   get actual message text, plus the exception itself
X now using actual sketch name (instead of temp name)
X   this should be safe since launching an external vm to run
X make the p5 icon show up for the window
X   when launching a new sketch
X   can embed icon.gif as byte array in PApplet, and use Toolkit.createImage

cleaning
X NullPointerException inside setup() comes up weird
X   because NullPointerException is a RuntimeException
X   maybe the renderer exception is something different? newrendex?
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=78
o weird exception in the run button watcher
X   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=42
X exceptions in draw() apps aren't caught
X   the program resize(200, 200); just does nothing (doesn't complain)
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=81
X exception in setup() on external app doesn't kill run button
X   also doesn't kill external vm
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=79
X   fixed in the 0140s
o make editor nicer
o   tab on selection indents whole block
o   shift-tab outdents whole block
o   ctrl-t to format selection
o     if no selection, indents line?
X   addressed these in other ways


0145 pde
X insert non-breaking space characters instead of spaces on DiscourseFormat
X   works on safari (though not camino/firefox) on osx
X   works on internet explorer w/ windows


0144 pde
X add new reference and examples
X write revisions.txt entry that covers changes since 0135
X format for discourse is ignoring the selection
X   also shouldn't add (so much) extra space to the beginning and end
o add tool for running in jview
o   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=142
o   calls export, or only available after export (or when an applet dir exists)
o   warn user that applet html will be over-written
X   no longer supporting 1.1
X on startup, make sure that the jdi classes are available
X   if not, tell the user to install a friggin jdk
X   this way we can release a windows version w/o java
X don't open more than one copy of the preferences window
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=830
X modify namespace handling in xml lib
X   changed getFullName() to getName()
X   changed getName() to getLocalName()
o look through the code for any places where UTF-8 not used

text handling
X block comment - don't bother with last line if starting it
X   (same behavior as eclipse)
X add block comment to right-click menu
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=840
X add increase/decrease indent to edit and right-click edit menu
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=841

fix problems with vm crashing errors (OutOfMemoryError, etc)
o too many NPEs on loadimage may freeze the app (visualizar example?)
o   hopefully this should be fixed with 0136 changes
o   lots of runtime exceptions still being lost on osx
o     particularly with multi-threaded applications
o   macosx dropping exceptions all the time.. grr
o     solution is to export, and then see how it runs
o     this is particularly bad with threaded applications


0143 pde
X fixed build problems with macosx and linux, thanks to reports
o need to compare with localized version of javac strings
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=828

X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=817
X move copy for discourse into the edit menu (ctrl-shift-c)
X nanoxml getChildren() et al should use getFullName() not getName()
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=813

charset changes
X make sure that export is using utf8 for writing the .pde files etc
X   should be primarily loadFile() and saveFile() inside Base
X change pde files to use utf8
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=743
o   1) if file contains binary data and
o   2) its mod date is earlier than when p5 0125 was installed
o   point the user to Tools -> Reload sketch with local encoding
o   then re-save the file to update the mod date
o   ...or, when first running p5 0125, offer to update sketches
o     this is a bad idea--since it's probably
X need to set a default charset for use in files (utf8)
X   add option to change charset or specify as part of loading
X   need to specify the default encoding

X   also, don't add /library/ for each lib to the classpath
X remove unused libraries from default run path
X   note that this will hose svg b/c xml not available

new debugger/runner setup
X wire in new debugging classes, get sys.out and sys.err working
X quitting p5 doesn't shut down the runner
X make out/err streams go to the correct window

X initiate external stop and close events to the vm
o see if stop() has same 'finished' problem with not immediate quit

o   both on windows and mac... is there a way put up useful message
o if everything moved into the .app file, how do you add applet.html?
o can we use useragent to determine whether java 1.4 is in use?
o   for mac, could see if it's an old safari (1.3) or firefox (also 1.3)
o   for windows, the classid will take care of it all (firefox too?)
o   for linux, everyone's using 1.4/1.5 anyway
X rewrite section on versions of java
X   we're dropping support for anything before 1.4
X   and don't recommend anything before 1.4.2
X   we'll support 1.5 a little more now, but only libraries, not syntax

o   although.. this only works on panther.. how many are using it?
X   filed as http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=431
o changing font size in editor not updating all font objects
o   particularly after backspace

0116 pde
o including function outlines in the code?
o   i.e. make setup() and draw() for people? seems silly.. not much to do
o when importing a library, insert 'captureEvent'?
o   again, seems to fraught with potential problems
o saveFrame() directly to quicktime via port of DbnRecorder
o   do this after beta, not likely to work with java 1.4 on macosx
X   moviemaker class from dan shiffman handles this
X make message status text dark instead of white.. too subtle
o is there a way to set the color of the Frame growbox?
o   currently it's white instead of dark gray like the ui
o   setBackground(Color) didn't seem to help inside PdeBase.<init>
X   moot point because grow boxes removed in later os releases
X ignore sketches that have ._blah.java or ._blah.pde files
X   this could cause crashes on macosx
X be more strict about opening sketches with illegal characters
X   in previous releases, it was possible to rename sketches outside p5
X   to something that was illegal. now those files are ignored
X better fix for find/replace focus issue on osx

o p5 becomes a memory hog (benelek and glen murphy)
o   not confirmed for a long time
o   even without sketches open, perhaps not gc'ing properly
o   objects probably not getting finalized
o   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=29
X add pref item for setting the memory properly
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=233
o   external apps should inherit memory settings from p5 itself
X   too confusing to set the memory in two places
X   or perhaps, have a setting in the ide for it
o   and allow a checkbox for "always run externally"
X   that way people don't have to adjust the memory settings for p5 itself
X   perhaps the memory setting should be enabled/disabled
X     that way if it's enabled, will always run externally
o menu weirdness (benelek)
o   when you've got a menu open, move a cursor over the text area
o   and back over the menu, the text-area cursor type remains.
X   mark this as wontfix, since it's just a java bug

X   Creating bitmap images - from advanced.html
X the "export folder" command doesn't seem to work at all
X   check with casey, see if he's using it
o fix up how archive sketch saves files
X   bring up name, and let people change if they want

X   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html
X   requires a signed applet or local application
X pmouseX and pmouseY have different values in mouse methods vs. draw()

fixed in previous releases
X why is gl being added on export, no matter what? or is it?
X   applet folder not really being emptied on export
X   so old libs will just perpetuate themselves
X moving an external window around a lot will halt the parent
X   does move even need to be called? could just wait till stop?

X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1114113204;start=0

X   opengl not tested for applets
X   to get to opengl functions, put this after size:

X list of known bugs should be on the faq page
X   a bunch of stuff from revisions.txt on 84 and 82
o   how to deal with bugs, since there are so many known...

save as... bugs
X always make sure that the sketch folder still exists
X   otherwise editor gets into a weird state
(v74) if a project folder is made (with save as), and then deleted
while processing is still open, there is an error (of course).  but
the error ('file/folder not found') is not displayed to the user, and
the drop-downs don't go away / the IDE doesn't refresh.

X remove a folder if someone tries to replace it via "save as"
what happens if folder already exists on save as?
saving a project over an already existing project does not get rid of
the .pde files that arent overwritten.  not sure if this is feature or
bug, but it took me by surprise.  it seemed to only overwrite .pde
files with the same name, but everything else in that project folder
stays as is.

X sketch renaming fixed
X   rename, change, was asking about the old sketch name
Minor issue, but caused me a couple seconds of confusion. If you
rename your sketch then try to close the application without saving
first, it asks you if you want to save but mentions the pre-rename
name. But I hit yes, quit, came back in, and all seemed right in the
world.

X "save as" not actually saving properly
File>New
edit file...
File>Save As
File>Open some other file
File>Open original file
file is empty.
the only way to make File>Save As actually save new files, as far as i
can tell, is to Save As once, make at least one change, then Save.

X fix hide/unhide bug... just was dumb code
create a new sketch
create a new tab named "a"
create a new tab named "a_2"
hide tab named "a_2"
hide "a"
unhide "a_2"
unhide "a"
where did "a_2" go ?

X move everything to packages, and start auto-javadoc
X how to get preproc to automatically prepend packages

X   actually, this was already in there
o add prompt() method to serial

camera
o setting the camera should be an index from list()
o   there might be multiple cameras with the same name
X   no can do, the function takes a String for the device name
o list() should return full list with all sub-components
X   find the example code from the board
X grabbing sub-devices from camera in the lib (via list() or whatever)
o   actually, need to use numbered indices (multiple w/ same name)
o     list should be: "0 - Logitech QuickCam (Blah)"
o     and then use the indices (or the str i guess) to choose
X   format(NTSC) or PAL or SECAM
X   source(COMPOSITE) or SVIDEO or COMPONENT
X settings() brings up settings dialog
o add prompt() method to Camera ("" means default, null is prompt)
o   let them pass in prompt(), not use null
o   null is only bringing up settings dialog, that's wrong

X   add 'make' to list of things that should be installed
X update libraries/howto.txt
o   should we queue lib events until the end of loop?
X   nope, libraries can handle that themselves,
X     and queue events by registering for draw or whatever they'd like
X   lib could call queueEvent with the args
X   then call them inside post()

saturday evening and sunday morning

X implemented ryan alexander's grow box design
o when centering applet on-screen, needs to check for multiple screens
o   this is both for PApplet and PdeRuntime

o particles lib requires depth() (but shouldn't)
o   fix for 78 since not sure when simon's new version is happening
X   requires because uses 3D.. oh well
o "draw" is not highlighted as a keyword.. other keywords?
o   draw(), PGraphics(), NO_DEPTH_TEST, PMovie(), PMovie.repeat()
o   PClient(), PClient.available(), PClient.read(),
o   PServer(), PServer.dispose(), PServer.write(), attach(), length
o   round() is not colored

X examples have been updated

fixed in rev 79
X can't scroll the PdeEditorConsole downwards at all on osx

purged
o refresh sketchbook menu upon returning to the app from elsewhere?
o   this would need to track whether coming just from an ext runtime
o make "get quicktime libs" function
o   can java get the root directory for system/win32 etc?
X add MRJOpenApplicationHandler and MRJOpenDocumentHandler
X     especially the open document fella
X     under osx, app won't get doc unless app already launched


0079 pde

X   fix all warnings generated by the new jikes
X   update windows version of jikes.exe

X     make sure that fink is not in the path when building
X     what are the args to configure a release version?
X   update linux version of jikes
X look for size() method to determine default size of applet
X   (same as applet exporter function)
o when using core graphics, don't show applet frame until first frame
o   (in opengl, open frame early, make sure this isn't inhibited)
X   probably can't do this, since don't know at runtime if it's gl
X RuntimeException errors are a little prettier
X updated windows icon
X make macosx use kUserDomain to grab Documents folder
X   this is just-in-case, who knows what they're up to over in cupertino


0076 pde
X fix launcher issues on windows (didn't include registry.jar)
X   also fix run.bat and run-expert.bat
X fix launcher issues on mac os x

o   option to ignore or match case
X   when hitting 'find', select the text in the field
X   add extra space to exterior of find (especially on windows)
X fixes to the horizontal scrollbar
X   still not perfect, but some tweaks for improvement
X horizontal scroller is always present
X   fixed, was a problem of sizing with the new inset size
X cosmetic fixes
X   is PdeEditorHeader one pixel too tall
X   move the tabs over just slightly
X resize box intrudes on the scroller for the console area
X   need to set grow boxes intruding to false
X   1.3 version (deprecated):
X     -Dcom.apple.mrj.application.growbox.intrudes=false
X   1.4 version (much nicer): -Dapple.awt.showGrowBox=false
X add mkdmg script to macosx build process
X   could significantly speed things up
X make sure that the preproc stuff gets built once
X   especially straight out of cvs
X menu option for Renderer > to "Core" or "OpenGL"
X   on export, uses this setting to determine if jogl is added to project
o if additional tab is "public" class.. then make external?
X   this seems too dangerous
X make font builder vertically resizable
X   200 pt font hoses things / hides buttons
X rename/delete work
X   rename is now enabled on the first tab
X   delete on first tab will also delete the entire sketch
X   leaving an empty sketch will remove it
X     avoids creating a zillion sketches when deleting/clearing up sketchbook
X   disable 'hide' menu item for the main code tab

sketchbook/prefs location
X read from registry key to get the proper name for these folders
X   also find some way to do this on the mac
X   on non-english windows (or at the broad) these will be named differently
X   http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=221837&sd=RMVP
X   or is there a proper way to do this with java params?
X move to ~/Application Data/Processing for windows
X   and ~/Library/Processing for macosx
X   and ~/.processing for linux
X   if it can't write prefs here, try creating a subfolder inside p5
X     and if that fails, then tell the user that they suck
X prompt for sketchbook location on linux
X   or on mac/pc if it can't write anywhere else
X creating sketchbook / lab situations
X   test to see if it's possible to write to "My Documents"
X   if not, should bring up a prompt asking where to put sketchbook
X   also put something in lib/preferences.txt for default location
X     this way a course admin can change the default location
o need to check if volume is read-only, notify and quit if it is
o   people are trying to run off the disk image
o   actually that should be fine..
o     but make sure the prefs location can be written
o   need to pay attention to when running from read-only drive
o     reported by brandenberg
o    "p5 will launch from the disk image, but will
o     not draw the sketch name bar doesn't appear"
X include preferences.txt option to write to p5 folder first
X   this can be altered by instructors and re-packaged
X fixed a couple bugs causing the jnilib stuff to crash
X put 'play' on a SwingWorker thread
X   test this on a pc to see how it goes, especially with opengl
X   doesn't seem to help anything
X PdeRuntime -> SystemOutSiphon, removed MIN_PRIORITY setting
o hack to not use console on the code folder
o   no errors will propogate, but it should run fine
X lib/build should not be a subfolder of p5
X   p5 environment installed to /Applications on lab machines
X   instead use a temp folder
X   maybe when running on lab machines in that case, always java mode?
X   or is it possible to add to java.class.path while app is running?
X     have to use a special class loader
X new class loader for single files
X   if more than one class defined, forces it to run externally
X     (basically any time it sees "class" in the code..
X     may be subject to errors, but errs on side of just running ext)
X   runs out of processing data folder
X fix for toolbar being one pixel off breaks the windows version
X   need to only do the fix on the mac.. ugh
X macosx is using /Library instead of ~/Library.. get this fixed
X   domain version wasn't in the stubs.. grr
X   or maybe it's an int or something?
X   just use reflection to call the function instead
X "use external editor" is broken
X   throws exception on load()
X make preproc only build once (across osx, windows, linux)
X preproc: making all functions public that have no specifier
X   this will make draw() etc all much easier
X   as well as the library events
X   focusGained/focusLost was added..
o if a data file is in the sketch (not data) folder export breaks
o   works fine in the editor, but on export gets a nullpointer ex
X   no way around this, because needs to be able to read from local dir
X if saving a read-only sketch, default to sketchbook folder
X   (before was prompting to save inside the same folder.. annoying)

building libraries - not gonna build libs in p5 ide for 1.0
o compiling - main file is a .java not a .pde
o   also where no root .pde file with the same name.. (i.e. video)
o on "new library" fill in the default code for the lib
o record imports from java files as well
o ignore imports from java.* or maybe just things pde's classpath
o after export of library, rebuild "import library" menu
o write export-to-library
o   need to be able to produce the serial, video, etc libs
o   see if sonia project can compile

libraries
X libraries could handle a series of events..
X   i.e. a 'completion' event, or 'new data' event
X   these could be registered on obejcts in a general way
X implemented many events
X  movieEvent, cameraEvent, soundEvent
X  serialEvent, clientEvent, serverEvent
X if videoEvent exists, don't auto-read?
X   though for serial this would only grab the last byte
X   video bug on osx? an error message when quitting video sketches:
X   java.io.IOException: Bad file descriptor
X     at java.io.FileInputStream.readBytes(Native Method) etc... ).
o bring back some form of beginSerial/beginVideo
o   openSerial(), serial()..
o   should it prompt or use the first available if none specified?
X run library destroy after hitting 'stop'
X   quicktime audio doesn't stop after hitting 'stop'
X   weirdness external stop not calling stop(), just finished = true
X bring back serial event via reflection
X add serial.last() to api
X video - try to replicate bug that causes hang with camera
X   happens when winvdig, camera or quicktime are not properly installed
X   documented better in bugs.txt, and sometimes caught in Camera.<init>

fixed in previous releases
X dist.sh needs to auto-remove .DS_Store boogers
X write script to remove .DS_Store and CVS folders from dist
X   # remove DS_Store files
X   sudo find . -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \;
X add a "make archive" option
X   doesn't rename sketch, just names zip file sketch + time stamp

hanging bug - now fixed, need to post on the board about it
X keypressed hanging on applets with a code folder
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081450102
X problems running external vm/vm is hanging
X   seems to be happening because of virus scanning software (norton)

X     something in that one about mouse position halting or not
to try: 1) don't use a bufferedreader.. just read it and then use a
buffered reader around the byte array 2) don't do anything with the
input, and just read it off without signalling message()
* it may be something to do with the editor consoles. try shutting off
output to the console and see if it'll still crash.
* most likely related to io streams to the external java process. when
run via a disconnected process, using "cmd /c start java", the thing
will never hang. in that instance, the process terminates almost
immediately, and no i/o needs to happen (since it's a cmd prompt that
never shows up).
* it could also be a graphics sync bug that just gets more testy
because the environment, a second java process, is running at the same
time. mis.newPixels() may hork since it's over in the applet's thread,
and it might be calling repaint() or Toolkit.sync() to update the
image on-screen.
* shows up on key presses.. not sure if this is because of the actual
key press, or if it's because they're often accompanied by a println()
* blank spaces in filenames/parent folder often cause trouble.. not
sure if related. same for PATH and CLASSPATH.
* some virus scanning software, particularly older NAV versions cause
the trouble.

X   the same as the enclosing folder?
X   maybe put up a window saying no way, and ask:
X   ( ) rename enclosing or ( ) add a subfolder
X   or maybe even ( ) rename the sketch file
X   also double-check to see if there *is* a proper pde in the folder
X     in which case, default to that (maybe show a message?)
X   it's useful to have loose .pde files be runnable..
X   i.e. when double-clicking on them.. downloaded off web..

o   3:23:3:25 -> line 3, col 23 to 25
o   decided a bad idea, too difficult
X don't bother with 'advanced' on export dialog
X   that can come later, if needed

X   sun won't want us to say things are .java when they aren't
X .pde files opened on their own
X what should the prefs file be named?
X horizontal buttons? need final decision [yes]
X remove underscores from the tab title?
X   nope, casey says not necessary
X need nice yes/no dialog boxes, also

o   when not exporting with new preproc code, imports all on same line
o   make preproc keep track of how many lines were added
X rewrite video, net, serial libraries to be separate
X move the mac to java 1.4
X   1.4 is being used externally, and wheel mouse would be nice
X   not doing currently, lots of strange repaint bugs
X     all fixable for sure, but no point before beta since low priority
X macosx.. random lockups seem common in 1.4
o completeness of toInt/toFloat/toBoolean etc in preproc and PApplet
X error if you try to hit export twice on a sketch (just make synch'd)
X   "C:/ProgramFiles/proce55ing/processing-0060/sketchbook/default/double_export_tesuble_export_test.java:1:625:7:2: Semantic Error: Unable to write file

o   (currently cannot because it quits before getting response)
o   tried to pop up a modal Dialog in exactly the same location
o     but couldn't remove the decoration from the window (jvm bug?)
o     because it just quit without finishing
X prefs need to have a default
X   otherwise old prefs and new p5 will cause trouble
X   actually, just need to make sure preferences.txt is up to date
X     load that before the other stuff
X     -> was already implemented like that
o fix the problem causing all the "couldn't delete" messages
o class naming from dan
o   If you name a class the same name as the sketch project,
o   you get an error about contained classes with duplicate names
o   when you try to export for web.
o quick fix inside PdeRuntime
o   if (loop == false) and (draw == false) then provide an error
o   so user knows that one or the other is needed


// notes on an implementation of a 'shape' class..
// as long as using an additional pde file...

..to still maintain rect() instead of g.rect()
..and the rest of the p5 features

// shape or "processing" means to add all kinds of methods like:
// public void point(float x, float y) {  g.point(x, y);  }
// and that the class 'implements' ShapeInterface..
//
shape class Something {

  void setup() {
    // not used, or called on first draw

    // but maybe required (even if behind the scenes)
    // so that this can use "implements ShapeInterface"
  }

  void draw() {  // uses internal g. that's been set by parent
  }
}

in the .pde parent:

void loop() {
  shape(somethingInstance);
}

where the shape() method in BApplet looks like:

shape(ShapeInterface o) {
  o.graphics(this.g);  // has to be a method, since intf
  o.draw();
}

X only allow one pmouseX update outside of loop
X   to avoid jumping lines (drawing -> continuous_lines)
X   email glen/amit/creas about the change
X can windows have multiple jre installed and use any of them?
o another odd NullPointerException -> or just a "couldn't delete" problem
o  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1060341518
o java vm could be removed from cvs
o   in favor of requiring a specific jvm, and using registry to find
X see if mods to PdeCompiler work on windows
X remove "couldn't delete.." messages
X modify how size() works
X   allow size() to be called multiple times
X   only works once in applet
X   be able to set size() later in the program
X   but still maintain other features like background
X   make the BGraphics constructor less fragile
X     and also more open to being resized when not in applet mode

X   now at least spews the exception
X removed ugly white borders from ui on macosx java 1.3
X   is there anything better that can be done for osx java 1.3
X   setInsets() to zero or something?

X screenGrab() shouldn't allocate a new pixel buffer
X   just write things out directly
X   also fix for the new targa code
X added a note about needing forward slashes
X   In the config file, the sketchbook path works if you use forward
X   slashes, but not if you use unescaped backslashes.
X draw mode issues.. size and background must be int/float constants
X   might be a better 'mode' for bagel so bkg and size cmds work
X   rather than app being enclosed in beginFrame/endFrame loop

X removed SMOOTH_IMAGES
X removed shearX and shearY
X toxi image code (!)
X   need background(BImage) and scaling, copy area, etc.
X vertex(x, y, u, v) and vertex(x, y, z, u, v)
X don't cast color()
X   since more important for color(v1, v2, v3) to work
X getPixel/setPixel -> get/set..
X   get(x, y, w, h) is nice but no set(x,y,w,h)
X   though set(x,y,w,h) could be nice
X   and copy() to copy a section of pixels
X BImage.save()
X   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1062076172
X resize should call background again to set color
X   if background was set before the resize
X   and the background is not an image (or should it just stretch?)
X     no need for image, since it has to be same size
X     and is only explicitly drawn when background() is called
X BGraphics subclasses BImage
X   inherits all image manipulation and image use methods
X background(BImage)
X   also creating background image inside setup()
X images drawn from center don't work for simage()
X   currently calling slower image routine
o make zbuffer available instead of g.zbuffer
o shape.. non-homogenous colors for beginShape()
o   currently disabled b/c homogenousColors not set false for vertices
X should image(img, x, y, alpha) work instead of using fill?
X   write tint() command
X   or maybe another word for fill/stroke.. apply? colorize?

X colorMode is defaulting to 255, 255, 255, 1.. oops
X   though setting it differently hoses everything (clears everything)
X setup (200, 200) causes the default size to be used
X be able to draw something inside setup (?)

TODO CLEANUP
o online signup cgi for people to add themselves to the list
o probably should doClose() on new/open instead of doStop()
o option to delete current project (trickier)
o   also needs to have method for verify.. blech
o check logs to see where we're getting traffic from
o option to toggle console on/off (not just in properties, but realtime)
o look into using serialporteventlistener for simpleserial
o   may help with problems due to threading/synchronizing
o font usage/substition solution
o   write code to bind/convert java fonts
o     best would be freetype or jdk 1.3/1.4
o   java freetype? jni freetype to build texmap fonts?
o   look at flash file format? (does it have kerning?)
o may want to throw exceptions from bagel
o   but catch them inside bapplet--as part of making things easier
o file i/o utility classes
o   read as set of lines, read as cells in grid, read num sequence
o   then methods for writing all of the same
o stop() method in applet should stop kjc environment
o   should be able to call stop() to 'quit' an applet
X make versions available w/o fonts and jre
o moving sketchbook folder for lab environments
o adding lights
o   control of position/color of default lights
o controlling camera movements
o   mcguffin sent some notes about this
o multmatrix/identity
o constants besides PI, TWO_PI
o min/max with 3 parameters
o if (a) ? 3 : 4
o formatting printf-style things
o audio input
o audio synthesis
X stringutils.split is a useful one
X readFileLines et al
o translateMiddle() ? to move to the middle of the screen?
o perlin noise function
o delayUntil would be nice to have
o   but at some point there has to be a cutoff
o   have a library of useful code that people can add to programs
o   otherwise things are too simple, and env is a crutch
o example: multi-user server app (shared whiteboard)
o example: basic network app
o bug in sun vm for freaking out
o   also happened with ibm vm.. grr.. (or was it a path problem?)
X is it necessary to have fullscreen option on toolbar anymore?
o what's better than POLYGON_CONVEX and POLYGON_CONCAVE?
o should we use jdk 1.3 or msft vm?

Removing all sketches would solve the problem.
/ lots of problems in moving sketches over
 i managed to run p5 from the applications folder once, but i think when i moved my sketches over from 0044 it broke: "uncaught exception in main method: java.lang.NullPointerException"
 i tried reinstalling and running 'java -cp lib:lib/build: ...' and it worked fine (and would open from the icon afterwards)
again, after i moved my sketches over it broke permanently...
/ 46 dies when run from desktop on some machines [jes]
/   spaces in the dir name?

X undo/redo can go to far
X docs
X   make a note that size() has to come first [nluken]
X   look at the code that's created in build/
X known issues
X   random freezes.. especially under windows
X   wheel mouse is gone again, to return later
X describe rundown of constants pulled from pde.properties
X   coloring for syntax
X   sketchbook.path, very preliminary, still creates 'default'
X macos9 stuff
X   check to see if swing is working properly
X   get new release out, remove 1.3 specific stuff from textpane
X get syntax coloring debugged?
X   talk to casey about better default colors
X scroll to beginning after setText()
X color not set for default text area with empty text
X   color not set on 'new', setForeground won't do it
X   probably reasonably simple fix, but not in time
X undo/redo
X   should enable/disable as available
X   undo-ing too much will empty the text area
X     the setText is an undoable thing. grr.
X method to set a folder for the sketchbook
X when trying to use serial, provide error if things not installed


0046
X install new swing-based textarea with syntax highlighting
X   improve the flicker problems (re-enable backing store?)
X   set better defaults for coloring
X   implement edit menu
X   implement undo/redo
X   re-implement sketchModified
X these boxes overlap but shouldn't:
X   may be simple <= instead of <, leftover from dbn
int thick = 36;
size(200, 200);
background(0);
noStroke();
fill(153, 163, 0.0);
rect(80, 0, thick, height/2);
fill(102, 112, 0.0);
rect(100, height/2, thick, height/2);
X re-implement sketchModified yet again (using keylistener)
X set font on textarea in case things break
X need examples to work for submenus (casey's got too many)
X why is javax.comm included a zillion times in exported .java file?
X fix issues with new swing-based text area
X   auto indent on next line no longer works
X   tabs no longer convert to 2 spaces
o   balance parens is no longer available
X problem with axel's strings example [might be related to long lines]
X   freezing problem, compiler was crashing and spewing bad message
X move build directory to root in cvs (on server)
X   and update scripts accordingly
X should java 1.3 classes be included in the imports
X   but not for exported applets? (might create some confusion)
X   included java audio classes for 1.3
X   included xml classes for 1.4
X pmouseX should be set at the end of loop(), not on mouse movement
X allow 3d curves
X   curveVertex and bezierVertex that take 3 args
X   3d versions of bezier() and curve()
X preprocessor tweaks
X   "http://acg.media.mit.edu" doesn't work because of //
X   "color.jpg" -> "int.jpg" causes trouble
X why does this line cause an error?
// String url = "http:\u002f\u002fwww.Proce55ing.net";
X   it's not in the preprocessor, but kopi seems to be having trouble
X seems that file i/o may be picking up lots of extra \r
X   perhaps when doing setText, it's goobering things up
X when renaming a sketch, select the text in the field,
X   so you can type the new name immediately.
X added 'rename' command
X   also the default for clicking on the sketch's title
o   option to rename when doing a 'save as' (remove old files)
X remove .class files on save as [dimitre]
X   remove .jar, .class, and .java files from the 'applet' dir
When I am working in a project and I save it with another name,
all the old files are copyied to new directory, and some of the old
unused .class files and images remains inside new project JAR files.
X serial port
X   better message for PortInUseException (full explanation)
X   better message for when serial port code not available/not installed
X set frame title of launched window to the name of the sketch

X macosx - check to see if swing is working properly
X macosx - update build script to work with new layout
X Add an Edit menu containing Undo/Redo/Cut/Copy/Paste/Select
  All. It's standard Mac behaviour.
X long list from frederik (fdb)
X If the cursor is at the last character of the last line of the
  text area, moving the cursor up or down using the arrow keys throws
  the following exception:
  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
    at PdeEditorListener.keyPressed(PdeEditorListener.java:86)
    at java.awt.Component.processKeyEvent(Component.java:3673)
X If the cursor is at the last character of the first line of the text
  area, moving the cursor up using the arrow keys throws the same
  exception. However, moving the cursor down doesn't throw one.
X Double-clicking a word doesn't select it, but the character after
  it. (however, sometimes the behaviour is correct)
X Scrolling action when using cursor keys is not consistent with other
  editors: The window should only scroll when it needs to; it now tries
  to keep the cursor on the current line. (or one line below it)
X Using Apple-shift-arrowLeft to select from the cursor pos to the
  beginning of the line, selects one character too little at the right
  side. Apple-shift-arrowRight has the same issue (selects one char too
  little at the left side).
X Using Apple-shift-arrowDown selects only from the beginning of this
  line to the end of the following line. It doesn't extend the
  selection when pressed twice. It also selects the line under the
  current line.
X Pressing the tab key moves to the bottom of the text area.
X hopefully fixed, but needs to be tested
? Select All (Apple-A) closes the application
  (Ctrl-Q) on Azerty-keyboards
X use date in the sketch name sketch_021104
X   with a _2 if needed or '021104a' '021104b' etc
X   when using save as, allow to remove the old (numbered) sketch
X better default size than 300x300 when starting up first time
X bug report from the site
resizing the editor window in Mac OS X leaves the status bar in
place. The result is an editor window with a grey bar layered on top,
obscuring the editable text.
X fix default fonts, font size on mac
X fix lots of annoying crap about highlighting lines on errors
X re-enable console, add synchronized (hrmph)
X added extra code for testing to for serial under osx
X   also suppressed error text in console for exception-less fail
X couldn't quit p5 when installed into a dir with spaces
X   properties were saved to a urlencoded place, %20 was causing trouble
X update dist script for new layout
X   put mac rxtx inside the p5 folder (hide it?)
X     include more strongly worded message about rxtx
X macos9: update build/dist scripts to work with new layout

X organizing directories, save to other directories blows up
X   for now, disallow the / or : characters
X   there was a bug that required a noop() b/c of jikes or 1.3 problems
X is problem w/ beautify that it has no menu event handler?
X   write event handler, and make sure it doesn't work for external ed
X don't popup offscreen if editor window is way left.
X   just make sure the x coord > 10 or so (if not presenting)
X     if so, pop up window 50, 50 from upper left corner
X   if it still won't fit, center the window on screen
X don't throw exceptions for serial on startup if no serial available?
o   gets upset on osx if rxtx not installed during menu building
X   actually, it just throws UnsatisfiedLinkError
X     make a note in the readme, particularly wrt macos
X readme additions
X   size() and background() need regular nums, no vars

X sketch window resizing strangely
X   can make width/height larger, but only height smaller
X   check apple site for technote/bug listing
X     jes grabbed examples for me
X   getMinimumSize() on textarea is probably causing trouble
X     better just to pre-empt it on the frame, b/c textarea didn't do much
X apple-a for select all tries to quit
X   can't reproduce
X escape on presentation mode--no key events seem to be coming through
X make default font size for editor the next size smaller

X     on export or naming sketches--no spaces(!)
o   changed by clicking on the name and typing
X new/duplicate/rename should rebuild skopen menu
X item to launch proce55ing.net
X item to launch reference in browser
X check all menus to make sure they all work/make sense
X   disable the ones that aren't implemented
X in progress working on presentation mode


0032
already finished
X need to update PdeKeyListener for new ui..
X   remove open, add d for duplicate, r for rename, others ?
X 'open' button is a switch-to button
X   pops up list of everything in the sketchbook
o   first item is 'new sketch', followed by delimeter
X   next is list of subdirs other than current user, then delim
X   the rest are the items in the current user's folder
X need 'new' button on the toolbar (or first sketch menuitem?)
o   the zero looking one might be good (instead of export)
o   export could be three circles in a row, overlapping
X everything is a project.. what about short snippets of code?
X   this version won't be able to access everything from scrapbook
X   (that requires a more robust class loader)
X sketch.properties contains the last program run
X   also the window positions, etc
X   saves screen size, so if screen size changed, window pos reset
X   if it doesn't exist, starts with a new project
X     for a new project, name it untitled-0001 or as appropriate
X       so that previous projects aren't written over
X verify save when
X   closing p5 window
X   moving to other sketch
X NullPointerException on startup in pde editor buttons
X   shows up on slower machines, probably images not loaded yet
X use a vm that won't destroy the screen like sun/ibm does
X   this means msft or newer version of jdk
X if default user, don't show the 'user' string in pde window
X item in pde.properties to set the name of the current user
X exporting
X   exporting applets that have custom name problems:
X     if extends processingapplet, the name user types must be same
X     gets confused about paths and puts boogers in weird places
X     doesn't compile correctly (must first compile with play)
X     doesn't include additional (private) classes
X   when exporting 'name of folder for export...'
X     default name should be from public class <xxxx>
X     because otherwise errors are happening
X     or name from user only determines folder name
X       if extends ProcessingApplet [more compatible]
X   make sure export is compiling first
X     right now have to hit play and then hit export (?)
X file structure for export
X   need to set project name for files
X   include other .class files built besides the main one
X     compile into 'classes' folder
X   include referenced image and font files (can't do if numbered)
X make close() work to kill applet in kjc
X save window x, y, width, height to pde.properties on exit
X stderr in red color
X 'data' directory for all media
X   make included media part of the .jar file
X   it's really a pain to use external files in processing
X     getStream sucks (zach rewrote)
X     should be able to work for application or applets
X     may want to use getResource() (to get things from .jar files)
X remove .java and .class files for compiled classes
X   (just clean up the boogers afterwards)
X compiling .java files leaves the .class files next to the .java
X   make sure all the dirs in sketchbook added to classpath on startup
o   if new dir added, must restart processing (this is acceptable)
X importing images doesn't work (?)
0032a
X put 'modified' indicator in the darker color
X fix bug with opening sketches from the menu (grr)
X need to check if file.exists() when opening
X   otherwise the exception doesn't get caught and app hangs
X switch to using a 'build' directory in lib for everything
X   lib\build can be added to the classpath at startup
X   cleanout build directory on each run (delete .class/.java)
X   temporary until classloader issues worked out
X implement popup menu
0032b
X add 'new' button (and complete ui)
X make toolbars work with sk
X make 'data' dir work with build
X   empty contents and change bagel to use getResource
X   also use getResource("data" + )
X make export work again
0032c
X getData -> gets contents of stream, puts into byte array
X remove everything from build when starting a new build
X   (don't do this until it's clear that it's working well!)


0031
X lib/pde.properties should be read using getResource
X   otherwise path issues cause trouble (likely under win98)
X take state information out of Header
X cleanup lastFile/lastDirectory
X save (just) last program run in sketch.properties
X coloring of error, message, etc changed in pde.properties
X finish save changes stuff
X editorlistener shouldn't track menu commands as changes to file
X   ctrl keys bksp/del/enter/return/tab then space on up
X   indicator for changes?
X   need to implement code for whether changes have been made
X   check for key events in textarea or something
X     if key events, compare contents against the existing file
X userName not getting set before sketchbook menu is built
X add 'refresh list' item to the sketchbook menu
X ability to set directory for compiling in kjcengine
X make sure compiling into build directory
X   and once compiled there, read all classes for export
X write class loader or figure out how to change classpath
X   might be able to load classes using forInstance on each file
X   using byte array version of constructor
X you should be able to create methods in drawing mode
X   this shouldn't work, make void draw() {} to allow


0030
X attempt to fold serial into bapplet, but mostly fail
X   convert color -> int
X     also include #ff00cc -> proper conversion
X   comments are removed from exported files


0029
X triangle() 6 parameters
X quad() 8 parameters
X rect/rectMode again
X remove addMouse/addKeyboard/addTime
X keyDown(), mouseDown(), lastMouseX, lastMouseY
X degrees(), radians()
X new color solution
X   make sure fxns come through (if static/final?)
X   color() -> uses colorMode
X   red/green/blue() hue/saturation/value() functions
X   getPixel/setPixel
X proposed color solution (canned)
o   color -> since color 'mode', responds to colorMode
o   getPixel/setPixel -> get/set int for purpose of moving pixels
o   get/set Red/Green/Blue/Hue/Saturation/Brightness -> uses colorMode
o   setColor(x, y, z) -> hsb or rgb via colorMode
X get casey setup with full cvs so that he can build w/ changes
X make sure lib/export is updated properly this time


0028
X modified pde.properties slightly for console and header
X need stdout in p5 window b/c mac has no stdout
X   remove class 'PdeEditorOutput' and 'PdeEditorLabel'(?)
X   added editor.console.lines to pde.properties
X int() and float() now work for casting
X draw mode needs to be better for workshops
X   make size() work for draw() mode
X     inside Engine, reach in and grab calls to 'size'
X     if call is not using a constant number, then punt
X   when exporting, needs to grab this size parameter as well
o related classes
X   resolved, just use inner classes for everything
o   better way to do parent and g.rect stuff in related classes
o     implement g. passed into any function called draw()
o     also important for things like cos, sin, max etc
o     but maybe once you're doing more advanced code, that stuff's ok
o       or using inner classes is better b/c class stuff works
o   related classes also need to implement pConstants
X fixed annoying findSelection bug spew on startup
X (fixed) 0.4f no longer allowed in the code
X size() code no longer checks for resize() and other similar things
X add char(), byte() to int/float stuff
X put jre into 'java' folder, include win32comm
X finish tweaks to folder layout in distribution ('java' subdir)
X   move p5 stuff out of lib so that dir can be moved more easily
X   maybe put bin/lib inside 'jre' folder and keep lib for p5
X   for people that want the space, they could remove 'jre'
X   will make much simpler to update
X serial is probably broken in newer versions b/c of 1.3
X   fixed, only win32comm was missing from dll dir


0027
X change editor.button_bgcolor -> editor.buttons.bgcolor
X if no 0 before decimal place in a number it breaks
X change plane to quad
X get new casey colors and buttons


0025
X change 'rect' to 'plane' (point/line/plane)
X   also rectMode to planeMode
X change QUADS to PLANES, QUAD_STRIP to PLANE_STRIP
X delay wasn't working for casey
X   works fine on pc.. maybe a mac problem
X   turned out to be a misunderstanding for loop()
X curve and bezier behave differently for indexing points
X   change bezier to act the same (each addl point)
X allow ui to be colored/skinned so creas can tweak
X make macintosh release
X   font file names are getting mangled on mac (too long)
X   new set of fonts, make sure the names are ok


0024
X bug fixes (lighting was broken)


0023
X not released, tweaks and bug fixes in paris hotel


0022
X not released, just working on tweaks and bug fixes


0021
X cosmetic ui update so that it's not so dbn-like
X   should this instead be simple colors update (no placement)
X move everything to new bagel api names
X having to put 'f' after everything is a mess
X   included oro matcher, no need to use anymore :)


0020
o fix bugs from the 'bugs' file
o   then remove the file from cvs
o   if fill(), need to draw several non-stroked planes
o   if stroke(), then draw single lines for each edge
o     do not duplicate edges for lines
o also problem filling on beginShape() triangle stuff
X z coordinates are backwards from gl (at least from mazo)
X   looked into it, this doesn't appear to be the case..
X   how did this happen? what's the appropriate way to fix?
X   in gl, positive z goes into the screen
X   may be able to do a scale(0, 0, -1) that doesn't affect dims
X     then when dims set to 3, will fix the z coords
X   this will also affect zbuffer ordering
X if BagelImage doesn't load, then image() calls arrayindexoutofbounds
X   better solution for this (error while opening image)
X get rid of 'kill' button
X int version of min and abs
X introduce pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pConstants (pSound)


0019
questions answered..
X is day, month, year overkill inside processingapplet?
X   decided no
X loadImage or getImage?
X   loadImage sounds better to ben and casey
X circle/square functions
X   doesn't seem necessary
X   main problem is that with ellipse, points aren't inside shape
X should the default be 100x100
X   yes, casey won
X default background color: 204
X   casey prevails again
X maybe stop/kill button should only be a stop btn - yes
X what to call 'pouch' directory? -- data
X function name to toggle drawing from center: ellipseMode(), rectMode()
X PImage, PFont or how to name?
X   pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pSound
X bezierVertex/catmullRomVertex poorly named (based on algo used)
X   instead curveVertex/fitCurveVertex/etc.
X   use curveVertex and bezierVertex
bagel miscellaneous
X change lightsOn/lightsOff to lights() and noLights()
X beginShape() defaults to POLYGON
X   introduce constants for other poly modes
X add ellipseMode(), rectMode()
X   CENTER_RADIUS, CENTER_DIAMETER, CORNER, TWO_CORNERS
X bezier and catmullrom aren't setting ndim to at least two
X   ?? not sure why they would
X translate(x, y) doesn't seem to affect a rect()
X   flat_rect was being used where ndim was 2, not 0
X curveVertex and bezierVertex instead of catmull/bezier crap
X single color function
X   need to clamp colors (nothing > 255 or < 0)
X     (garbage created when color values out of range)
X   do by simplifying stroke/fill/background inside bagel
X     these should be done w/ a switch (STROKE, FILL, BK, OTHER)
X     needs to be done inside cpp version too.. minimize amt of code
X   rewrite fill/stroke/etc to use same code
X     doesn't need to be super fast, so the extra assigns no big deal
X move MemoryImageSource out of bagel and into ProcessingApplet
X   need to run bagel to just render to a large internal buffer
X   this fits better with the c++ model of things
X make default size be 100x100
X make default background color 204
X lightsOff() seems dumb with noStroke and noFill
X   lights() and noLights()


0018

0011
X image(img, x, y) was broken for unwarped mode, disabled it


0010
X add java.* to top of processingapplet default base class used by kjc
X KjcProcessingApplet is dumb, kjc should make subst itself
o   give warning when compiling w/o kjcprocessingapplet
X random bug with an extra line being added in beginner mode
X   (threw off error markings)
X z=0 shit, 2D stuff needs to draw over z=0 plane

X fix crappy way of determining if inside a class--ignores comments
X   hope this fis works.. not tested much
X make acu fonts work again
X write code to use simple bitmap fonts
X add a file with bugs for testing
X kjc not smart enough to just compile things that are in classpath

X circle has been replaced with ellipse (uses xywh)
X box takes diameter, or width, height, depth [NOT IN CPP]
X sphere is the same as box [NOT IN CPP]

X   should shapes draw from center or from upper left?
X   should ovals use radius or diameter?
X   should shapes use x1, y1 - x2, y2 or x, y, w, h?
X nice to have a random number generator between -1..1
X   as well as an integer random; instead of just 0..1
X show creas how to get access to cvs
X documentation says 'mouseDown' even though it's 'mousePressed'
X font support
X   use gzip to compress bitmaps (made 115k vlw font -> 16k)
X   loadImage/loadFont or getImage/getFont?
X   text(char c), text(string s)
X   current acu fonts are broken
X image support
X   image() and 2D/2D affine versions of it
X   no stroke should show up on image()
X   fill being set on image() produces weird results
X     has to be set, but doesn't actually affect color
X min() seems funny/unavailable
X   worked fine for me


0009
X bagel fixes
X   beginShape(POINTS) is not working, no marks are appearing
X     this was a pain in the ass to fix
X   beginShape(LINE_LOOP) is not looping around

X running out of memory, presumably b/c applets not being cleared
X   happens inside init() of applet (at new Bagel())
X   figure out why threads aren't actually dying
X   disassociate processing applet with a window on stop?
