TODO CLEANUP
o online signup cgi for people to add themselves to the list
o probably should doClose() on new/open instead of doStop()
o option to delete current project (trickier)
o   also needs to have method for verify.. blech
o check logs to see where we're getting traffic from
o option to toggle console on/off (not just in properties, but realtime)
o look into using serialporteventlistener for simpleserial
o   may help with problems due to threading/synchronizing
o font usage/substition solution
o   write code to bind/convert java fonts
o     best would be freetype or jdk 1.3/1.4
o   java freetype? jni freetype to build texmap fonts?
o   look at flash file format? (does it have kerning?)
o may want to throw exceptions from bagel
o   but catch them inside bapplet--as part of making things easier
o file i/o utility classes
o   read as set of lines, read as cells in grid, read num sequence
o   then methods for writing all of the same
o stop() method in applet should stop kjc environment
o   should be able to call stop() to 'quit' an applet
X make versions available w/o fonts and jre
o moving sketchbook folder for lab environments
o adding lights
o   control of position/color of default lights

o   have a library of useful code that people can add to programs
o   otherwise things are too simple, and env is a crutch
o example: multi-user server app (shared whiteboard)
o example: basic network app
o bug in sun vm for freaking out
o   also happened with ibm vm.. grr.. (or was it a path problem?)
X is it necessary to have fullscreen option on toolbar anymore?
o what's better than POLYGON_CONVEX and POLYGON_CONCAVE?
o should we use jdk 1.3 or msft vm?

X macosx - update build script to work with new layout
X Add an Edit menu containing Undo/Redo/Cut/Copy/Paste/Select
  All. It's standard Mac behaviour. 
X long list from frederik (fdb)
X If the cursor is at the last character of the last line of the 
  text area, moving the cursor up or down using the arrow keys throws 
  the following exception: 
  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
    at PdeEditorListener.keyPressed(PdeEditorListener.java:86) 
    at java.awt.Component.processKeyEvent(Component.java:3673) 
X If the cursor is at the last character of the first line of the text
  area, moving the cursor up using the arrow keys throws the same
  exception. However, moving the cursor down doesn't throw one.  
X Double-clicking a word doesn't select it, but the character after
  it. (however, sometimes the behaviour is correct) 
X Scrolling action when using cursor keys is not consistent with other
  editors: The window should only scroll when it needs to; it now tries
  to keep the cursor on the current line. (or one line below it) 
X Using Apple-shift-arrowLeft to select from the cursor pos to the
  beginning of the line, selects one character too little at the right
  side. Apple-shift-arrowRight has the same issue (selects one char too
  little at the left side). 
X Using Apple-shift-arrowDown selects only from the beginning of this
  line to the end of the following line. It doesn't extend the
  selection when pressed twice. It also selects the line under the
  current line. 
X Pressing the tab key moves to the bottom of the text area.
X hopefully fixed, but needs to be tested
? Select All (Apple-A) closes the application 
  (Ctrl-Q) on Azerty-keyboards 
X use date in the sketch name sketch_021104 
X   with a _2 if needed or '021104a' '021104b' etc
X   when using save as, allow to remove the old (numbered) sketch
X better default size than 300x300 when starting up first time
X bug report from the site
resizing the editor window in Mac OS X leaves the status bar in
place. The result is an editor window with a grey bar layered on top,
obscuring the editable text. 
X fix default fonts, font size on mac
X fix lots of annoying crap about highlighting lines on errors
X re-enable console, add synchronized (hrmph)
X added extra code for testing to for serial under osx

X   write event handler, and make sure it doesn't work for external ed
X don't popup offscreen if editor window is way left. 
X   just make sure the x coord > 10 or so (if not presenting)
X     if so, pop up window 50, 50 from upper left corner
X   if it still won't fit, center the window on screen
X don't throw exceptions for serial on startup if no serial available?
o   gets upset on osx if rxtx not installed during menu building

X   check apple site for technote/bug listing

X put newline after imports header in exported .java files


0034
X make all windows 120x120?
X   default program should be large, 300x200 or so
X   what if it's smaller? boundary of color 51, 51, 51 around it
X implement presentation mode

X     include button in present mode to bring editor back up
X add frame to launched window

0032
already finished
X need to update PdeKeyListener for new ui.. 
X   remove open, add d for duplicate, r for rename, others ?
X 'open' button is a switch-to button
X   pops up list of everything in the sketchbook
o   first item is 'new sketch', followed by delimeter
X   next is list of subdirs other than current user, then delim
X   the rest are the items in the current user's folder
X need 'new' button on the toolbar (or first sketch menuitem?)
o   the zero looking one might be good (instead of export)
o   export could be three circles in a row, overlapping
X everything is a project.. what about short snippets of code?
X   this version won't be able to access everything from scrapbook
X   (that requires a more robust class loader)
X sketch.properties contains the last program run
X   also the window positions, etc
X   saves screen size, so if screen size changed, window pos reset
X   if it doesn't exist, starts with a new project
X     for a new project, name it untitled-0001 or as appropriate
X       so that previous projects aren't written over
X verify save when
X   closing p5 window
X   moving to other sketch
X NullPointerException on startup in pde editor buttons
X   shows up on slower machines, probably images not loaded yet
X use a vm that won't destroy the screen like sun/ibm does
X   this means msft or newer version of jdk
X if default user, don't show the 'user' string in pde window
X item in pde.properties to set the name of the current user
X exporting
X   exporting applets that have custom name problems:
X     if extends processingapplet, the name user types must be same
X     gets confused about paths and puts boogers in weird places
X     doesn't compile correctly (must first compile with play)
X     doesn't include additional (private) classes
X   when exporting 'name of folder for export...'
X     default name should be from public class <xxxx>
X     because otherwise errors are happening
X     or name from user only determines folder name
X       if extends ProcessingApplet [more compatible]
X   make sure export is compiling first
X     right now have to hit play and then hit export (?)
X file structure for export
X   need to set project name for files
X   include other .class files built besides the main one
X     compile into 'classes' folder
X   include referenced image and font files (can't do if numbered)
X make close() work to kill applet in kjc
X save window x, y, width, height to pde.properties on exit
X stderr in red color
X 'data' directory for all media
X   make included media part of the .jar file 
X   it's really a pain to use external files in processing
X     getStream sucks (zach rewrote)
X     should be able to work for application or applets
X     may want to use getResource() (to get things from .jar files)
X remove .java and .class files for compiled classes
X   (just clean up the boogers afterwards)
X compiling .java files leaves the .class files next to the .java
X   make sure all the dirs in sketchbook added to classpath on startup
o   if new dir added, must restart processing (this is acceptable)
X importing images doesn't work (?)
0032a
X put 'modified' indicator in the darker color
X fix bug with opening sketches from the menu (grr)
X need to check if file.exists() when opening
X   otherwise the exception doesn't get caught and app hangs
X switch to using a 'build' directory in lib for everything
X   lib\build can be added to the classpath at startup
X   cleanout build directory on each run (delete .class/.java)
X   temporary until classloader issues worked out
X implement popup menu
0032b
X add 'new' button (and complete ui)
X make toolbars work with sk
X make 'data' dir work with build
X   empty contents and change bagel to use getResource
X   also use getResource("data" + )

0032c
X getData -> gets contents of stream, puts into byte array
X remove everything from build when starting a new build
X   (don't do this until it's clear that it's working well!)


0031
X lib/pde.properties should be read using getResource
X   otherwise path issues cause trouble (likely under win98)
X take state information out of Header
X cleanup lastFile/lastDirectory
X save (just) last program run in sketch.properties
X coloring of error, message, etc changed in pde.properties
X finish save changes stuff
X editorlistener shouldn't track menu commands as changes to file
X   ctrl keys bksp/del/enter/return/tab then space on up
X   indicator for changes?
X   need to implement code for whether changes have been made
X   check for key events in textarea or something
X     if key events, compare contents against the existing file
X userName not getting set before sketchbook menu is built
X add 'refresh list' item to the sketchbook menu
X ability to set directory for compiling in kjcengine
X make sure compiling into build directory
X   and once compiled there, read all classes for export
X write class loader or figure out how to change classpath
X   might be able to load classes using forInstance on each file
X   using byte array version of constructor
X you should be able to create methods in drawing mode
X   this shouldn't work, make void draw() {} to allow


0030
X attempt to fold serial into bapplet, but mostly fail
X   convert color -> int
X     also include #ff00cc -> proper conversion

X remove addMouse/addKeyboard/addTime
X keyDown(), mouseDown(), lastMouseX, lastMouseY
X degrees(), radians()
X new color solution
X   make sure fxns come through (if static/final?)
X   color() -> uses colorMode
X   red/green/blue() hue/saturation/value() functions
X   getPixel/setPixel
X proposed color solution (canned)
o   color -> since color 'mode', responds to colorMode
o   getPixel/setPixel -> get/set int for purpose of moving pixels
o   get/set Red/Green/Blue/Hue/Saturation/Brightness -> uses colorMode
o   setColor(x, y, z) -> hsb or rgb via colorMode
X get casey setup with full cvs so that he can build w/ changes
X make sure lib/export is updated properly this time


0028
X modified pde.properties slightly for console and header
X need stdout in p5 window b/c mac has no stdout
X   remove class 'PdeEditorOutput' and 'PdeEditorLabel'(?)
X   added editor.console.lines to pde.properties
X int() and float() now work for casting
X draw mode needs to be better for workshops
X   make size() work for draw() mode
X     inside Engine, reach in and grab calls to 'size'
X     if call is not using a constant number, then punt
X   when exporting, needs to grab this size parameter as well
o related classes
X   resolved, just use inner classes for everything
o   better way to do parent and g.rect stuff in related classes
o     implement g. passed into any function called draw()
o     also important for things like cos, sin, max etc
o     but maybe once you're doing more advanced code, that stuff's ok
o       or using inner classes is better b/c class stuff works
o   related classes also need to implement pConstants
X fixed annoying findSelection bug spew on startup
X (fixed) 0.4f no longer allowed in the code
X size() code no longer checks for resize() and other similar things
X add char(), byte() to int/float stuff
X put jre into 'java' folder, include win32comm
X finish tweaks to folder layout in distribution ('java' subdir)
X   move p5 stuff out of lib so that dir can be moved more easily
X   maybe put bin/lib inside 'jre' folder and keep lib for p5
X   for people that want the space, they could remove 'jre'
X   will make much simpler to update
X serial is probably broken in newer versions b/c of 1.3
X   fixed, only win32comm was missing from dll dir


0027
X change editor.button_bgcolor -> editor.buttons.bgcolor
X if no 0 before decimal place in a number it breaks
X change plane to quad

X   also rectMode to planeMode
X change QUADS to PLANES, QUAD_STRIP to PLANE_STRIP
X delay wasn't working for casey

X   change bezier to act the same (each addl point)
X allow ui to be colored/skinned so creas can tweak
X make macintosh release
X   font file names are getting mangled on mac (too long)
X   new set of fonts, make sure the names are ok

0023
X not released, tweaks and bug fixes in paris hotel


0022
X not released, just working on tweaks and bug fixes


0021
X cosmetic ui update so that it's not so dbn-like
X   should this instead be simple colors update (no placement)
X move everything to new bagel api names
X having to put 'f' after everything is a mess
X   included oro matcher, no need to use anymore :)


0020
o fix bugs from the 'bugs' file
o   then remove the file from cvs
o   if fill(), need to draw several non-stroked planes
o   if stroke(), then draw single lines for each edge
o     do not duplicate edges for lines
o also problem filling on beginShape() triangle stuff
X z coordinates are backwards from gl (at least from mazo)
X   looked into it, this doesn't appear to be the case..
X   how did this happen? what's the appropriate way to fix?
X   in gl, positive z goes into the screen 
X   may be able to do a scale(0, 0, -1) that doesn't affect dims
X     then when dims set to 3, will fix the z coords
X   this will also affect zbuffer ordering
X if BagelImage doesn't load, then image() calls arrayindexoutofbounds
X   better solution for this (error while opening image)
X get rid of 'kill' button
X int version of min and abs
X introduce pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pConstants (pSound)


0019
questions answered..
X is day, month, year overkill inside processingapplet? 
X   decided no
X loadImage or getImage? 
X   loadImage sounds better to ben and casey
X circle/square functions
X   doesn't seem necessary
X   main problem is that with ellipse, points aren't inside shape
X should the default be 100x100
X   yes, casey won
X default background color: 204
X   casey prevails again
X maybe stop/kill button should only be a stop btn - yes
X what to call 'pouch' directory? -- data
X function name to toggle drawing from center: ellipseMode(), rectMode()
X PImage, PFont or how to name?
X   pImage, pFont, pGraphics, pSound

X   ?? not sure why they would
X translate(x, y) doesn't seem to affect a rect()
X   flat_rect was being used where ndim was 2, not 0
X curveVertex and bezierVertex instead of catmull/bezier crap
X single color function
X   need to clamp colors (nothing > 255 or < 0)
X     (garbage created when color values out of range)
X   do by simplifying stroke/fill/background inside bagel
X     these should be done w/ a switch (STROKE, FILL, BK, OTHER)
X     needs to be done inside cpp version too.. minimize amt of code
X   rewrite fill/stroke/etc to use same code
X     doesn't need to be super fast, so the extra assigns no big deal
X move MemoryImageSource out of bagel and into ProcessingApplet
X   need to run bagel to just render to a large internal buffer
X   this fits better with the c++ model of things
X make default size be 100x100
X make default background color 204
X lightsOff() seems dumb with noStroke and noFill
X   lights() and noLights()

X min() seems funny/unavailable
X   worked fine for me


0009
X bagel fixes
X   beginShape(POINTS) is not working, no marks are appearing
