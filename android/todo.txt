X fix problem with android emulator launching on Windows


_ if a sketch asks for android mode but it's not available
_   (after a double-click)
_   you get the "is android installed"? dialog, then it re-opens again
_   without closing the other

_ usb host and nfc reader need other changes to the app hierarchy to work
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=767

_ don't let the examples get overwritten with other mode stuff
_   the whole sketch.properties thing is yech

_ /opt/android using version #s again? fix build script

_ add INTERNET permissions to the android net examples

_ go through all basics/topics examples
_   remove those that don't make sense with android
_   remove size() commands from most/all
_     (or remove ones that truly require size...)
_   optimize for android use
_   need to set permissions as necessary (therefore add manifest files)

lifecycle/size changes/etc
_ pause/resume trickiness with interactive apps
_   can we serialize objects (even if slow?)
_   add pause() and resume() methods to PApplet -> this is start/stop
_ need to smooth out screen orientation changes
_ g2 and g3 are no longer disposed on pause (0195), but probably should be
_   they're deleted when dispose() is called (on exit()) 
_ register(this, "pause") -> libs will need pause events on android
_ add registered methods again
_   need to figure out generic event queueing first
_   may need a different subset of methods, and introduce new ones
_     that will be usable on both android and desktop
_ dispose() was calling disposeMethods.handle(), but they're null
_ possible major issue with sketches not quitting out of run() when in bg
_   pause needs to actually kill the thread
_   returning from pause needs to reset the clock
_   this is currently draining batteries
_ thread is continually running - 'inside handleDraw()' running continually
_   inside run() it shouldn't still be going
_ need sizeChanged() method... 
_   also add the param to the xml file saying that it can deal w/ rotation

_ temp files are not deleted
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=562

_ check out andres' changes for PShape

_ re: android libraries, from shawn van every
The most powerful part were the libraries (and the ease with which they could be developed).  Location, SMS, Camera/Video, Bluetooth (for Arduino integration) and PClient/PRequest were by far the most used.  The ones that came with it, plus the ones from MJSoft were good though I ended up making a couple of very specific ones for my students: http://www.mobvcasting.com/wp/?cat=4
_ separate activity and view
_ process trackball events (they're only deltas)
_ handle repeat key events 
_ implement link()
_ need to post android examples

_ try using the internal javac on windows and see if exceptions come through..
_   actually i think that might have been worse...

_ instructions on installing the usb driver for windows
_   http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html

_ error in 'create avd' with "Emulator already exists" when it needs an upgrade
_   or cannot be used with the current setup
_   use 'android list avds' on the command line to see the problem in this case
_ when there's a 'create avd' error, things still keep running. yay!

_ need to do this for utf8: "overridable Ant javac properties: java.encoding"
_   new for sdk tools r8, it's using ascii as the default, we're utf-8

_ error in 'create avd' with "Emulator already exists" when it needs an upgrade
_   or cannot be used with the current setup
_   use 'android list avds' on the command line to see the problem in this case
_ when there's a 'create avd' error, things still keep running. yay!

_ don't give user a "User cancelled attempt to find SDK" error message
_   it's annoying.. they f*king know they just did that
_ also gives an error if it unsets the sdk path itself, saying that the 
_   environment variable isn't set. which isn't true--it's set, but it doesn't
_   think the location is valid, which is totally different.
_   ...because it's ignoring the exception messages that come in from trying
_   to create the new sdk object

_ need to do something to make it easier to do new screen sizes.

_ add method to bring up the keyboard in sketches
_   actually, just write an example of how to do it, since holding menu works
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=234

_ sketches must be removed manually if the debug keystore changes
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=236

_ gui stuff: http://hg.postspectacular.com/cp5magic/wiki/Home

_ "failed to get signature key" problem
_   Caused by: /Users/aandnota/Documents/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools/ant/ant_rules_r3.xml:209: com.android.sdklib.build.ApkCreationException: Unable to get debug signature key

_ android sdk/build location has changed (android-7 not 2.1) fix build.xml

_ Blacked-out screen when restoring Android app from background.
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=381
_   probably related to the other thread hooey

_ saveStream() on processing-android-core.zip breaks behind firewall
_   downloads a 5kb html login page rather than the correct file

_ salaryper crashed when connecting to ctr500 and was re-routed
_   instead of sending back the gzip file, sent the error page
_   unlike java, where a 404 would give us null data

add to wiki
_ add to wiki: 1MB file size is max for data folder
_   Data exceeds UNCOMPRESS_DATA_MAX (11840328 vs 1048576)
_   File storage = android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();
_   File folder = new File(storage, "awesomeapp");
_   also check the data folder on run/export
_ add to wiki: orientation(PORTRAIT) and orientation(LANDSCAPE)
_   add to keywords.txt
_ ctrl-F12 (ctrl-fn-f12 on mac) will rotate the emulator

android menu
_ something to bring up the full console window
_ signing tool
_ selection of which avd (emulator), or plugged-in devices (if multiple)

_ change run/present/export/export application names in the menus

_ throw an error if a file in the 'data' dir ends with .gz

_ StreamPump has been quieted, but maybe this needs to be a global log setting

_ seems to have problems on 64-bit windows 
_   removing local version of java helped someone fix it

_ don't let the keystore message show up in red
_   Using keystore: /Users/fry/.android/debug.keystore

X look into touch event code, see if there's a good way to integrate
_   make a decision on how to integrate touch event code

_ for libraries that don't work with android, don't let them export
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=248
_   add line for export in libraries to say whether they're compatible
_     even just 'android=' will be ok
_     or 'mode=java,android,python'

_ error messages in runner that are handled special (OOME) need different
_   handling for android vs others.. argh

_ PShape examples are totally broken

_ clean up changes from andres
_   what is resetLights() in PGraphics?
_   remove model() method from end of PApplet (make it shape(PShape))

P1 this is embarrassing, need to fix ASAP
P2 need to fix before beta release
P3 would like to fix before final release
P4 not an immediate need, but very nice to have
P5 nice to have

CORE (PApplet, P2D et al)

P2 _ too many temporary objects (particularly w/ color) created with A2D
P2 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1399

P3 _ mouseClicked() is currently missing
P3 _   implement tap methods to handle mouseClicked() 
P3 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1406
P3 _ check on multiple pointers and multi-touch
P3 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1491

P4 _ when returning to the application after link(), screen stays blank
P4 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1484
P4 _ excessive rotation of application causes memory to run out
P4 _   this probably means that some memory isn't being freed that should be
P4 _   new window and surfaceview objects are being created in onCreate
P4 _     so they should probably be taken down in onDestroy.. but how?
P4 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1480
P4 _ values for pmouseX/Y aren't great
P4 _   Examples > Topics > Drawing > Continuous Lines shows gaps
P4 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1486

P5 _ Examples > Topics > Effects > Lens uses a ton of memory
P5 _ resize() needs to use the android resize stuff
P5 _   right now using the rather than expensive copy()
P5 _   instead, create a new resized bitmap, and get rid of pixels[]
P5 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1487
P5 _ should alpha PImage stuff use a non-4byte config?

TOOLS 

J only send error text to System.err (i.e. "Launching emulator" is not an error)
J   send these debug log messages to System.out
o "Sketch started on emulator" in spite of the emulator only halfway booted
o   sent email about this one

_ errors in ActivityManager aren't coming through
_ if AVD is deleted while processing still running, things flake out
_   also no error messages, just 'giving up on launching emulator'

// jdf maybedone
_ when out of memory, need an error message to show up in the PDE
_   show "OutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget" in status area
_   Examples > Topics > Drawing > Animator produces:
_   Uncaught handler: thread Animation Thread exiting due to uncaught exception
_   java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget
_     at android.graphics.Bitmap.nativeCreate(Native Method)

// jdf maybedone
_ stack overflow produced no error inside the PDE
_   probably same as memory error above

// jdf maybedone
_ if hitting 'run' in p5, need to kill any sketch that's currently running

_ need to make data folder copy more efficient than just copying everything
_   right now, first copies to src inside Build.java (which then copies to bin)

// jdf maybedone
_ other exceptions coming through System.err

SAVED FOR LATER

_ may need to add screen orientation as a built-in function
_   fairly common to use, and otherwise needs an obscure import

_ possibility of doing a compile (not run) using straight javac?
_   this would be a faster way to check for errors
_   w/o needing to use the incredibly slow android tools

_ maybe the back button shouldn't quit apps, the home button should?
_   back button use in apps is so infuriating...

OPTIMIZE / ENHANCEMENTS

_ don't re-calculate stroke() or fill() when it's the same value
_ should path.reset() or path.rewind() be used for a path to be reused?

_ errors that cause a crash when setting sketchPath
_   seems to be a filesystem that got too full
_   no real signs of what went wrong, but deleting the avd fixed it
_   if it reappears again, trap that condition, and tell the user the fix

_ show/hide the virtual keyboard
