X fix BufferedHttpEntity problem 
X   was trying to allocate a byte buffer for entire size of HTTP file

_ remove 'processing.test' package--people are posting on the market w/ it
_ Android mode does not recognize library imports
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=766
_ usb host and nfc reader need other changes to the app hierarchy to work
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=767

_ don't let the examples get overwritten with other mode stuff
_   the whole sketch.properties thing is yech

_ /opt/android using version #s again? fix build script

_ add INTERNET permissions to the android net examples
_ too many 'already exists' messages

_ go through all basics/topics examples
_   remove those that don't make sense with android
_   remove size() commands from most/all
_     (or remove ones that truly require size...)
_   optimize for android use
_   need to set permissions as necessary (therefore add manifest files)

lifecycle/size changes/etc
_ pause/resume trickiness with interactive apps
_   can we serialize objects (even if slow?)
_   add pause() and resume() methods to PApplet -> this is start/stop
_ need to smooth out screen orientation changes
_ g2 and g3 are no longer disposed on pause (0195), but probably should be
_   they're deleted when dispose() is called (on exit()) 
_ register(this, "pause") -> libs will need pause events on android
_ add registered methods again
_   need to figure out generic event queueing first
_   may need a different subset of methods, and introduce new ones
_     that will be usable on both android and desktop
_ dispose() was calling disposeMethods.handle(), but they're null
_ possible major issue with sketches not quitting out of run() when in bg
_   pause needs to actually kill the thread
_   returning from pause needs to reset the clock
_   this is currently draining batteries
_ thread is continually running - 'inside handleDraw()' running continually
_   inside run() it shouldn't still be going
_ need sizeChanged() method... 
_   also add the param to the xml file saying that it can deal w/ rotation

_ temp files are not deleted
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=562

_ check out andres' changes for PShape

_ re: android libraries, from shawn van every
The most powerful part were the libraries (and the ease with which they could be developed).  Location, SMS, Camera/Video, Bluetooth (for Arduino integration) and PClient/PRequest were by far the most used.  The ones that came with it, plus the ones from MJSoft were good though I ended up making a couple of very specific ones for my students: http://www.mobvcasting.com/wp/?cat=4
_ separate activity and view
_ process trackball events (they're only deltas)
_ handle repeat key events 
_ implement link()
_ need to post android examples

_ try using the internal javac on windows and see if exceptions come through..
_   actually i think that might have been worse...

_ instructions on installing the usb driver for windows

_ error in 'create avd' with "Emulator already exists" when it needs an upgrade
_   or cannot be used with the current setup
_   use 'android list avds' on the command line to see the problem in this case
_ when there's a 'create avd' error, things still keep running. yay!

_ need to do this for utf8: "overridable Ant javac properties: java.encoding"
_   new for sdk tools r8, it's using ascii as the default, we're utf-8

_ error in 'create avd' with "Emulator already exists" when it needs an upgrade
_   or cannot be used with the current setup
_   use 'android list avds' on the command line to see the problem in this case
_ when there's a 'create avd' error, things still keep running. yay!

_ don't give user a "User cancelled attempt to find SDK" error message
_   it's annoying.. they f*king know they just did that
_ also gives an error if it unsets the sdk path itself, saying that the 
_   environment variable isn't set. which isn't true--it's set, but it doesn't
_   think the location is valid, which is totally different.
_   ...because it's ignoring the exception messages that come in from trying
_   to create the new sdk object

_ need to do something to make it easier to do new screen sizes.

_ add method to bring up the keyboard in sketches
_   actually, just write an example of how to do it, since holding menu works
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=234

_ sketches must be removed manually if the debug keystore changes
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=236

_   Caused by: /Users/aandnota/Documents/android-sdk-mac_x86/tools/ant/ant_rules_r3.xml:209: com.android.sdklib.build.ApkCreationException: Unable to get debug signature key

_ android sdk/build location has changed (android-7 not 2.1) fix build.xml

_ Blacked-out screen when restoring Android app from background.
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=381
_   probably related to the other thread hooey

_ saveStream() on processing-android-core.zip breaks behind firewall
_   downloads a 5kb html login page rather than the correct file

_ salaryper crashed when connecting to ctr500 and was re-routed
_   instead of sending back the gzip file, sent the error page
_   unlike java, where a 404 would give us null data

add to wiki
_ add to wiki: 1MB file size is max for data folder
_   Data exceeds UNCOMPRESS_DATA_MAX (11840328 vs 1048576)
_   File storage = android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory();
_   File folder = new File(storage, "awesomeapp");
_   also check the data folder on run/export
_ add to wiki: orientation(PORTRAIT) and orientation(LANDSCAPE)

_ ctrl-F12 (ctrl-fn-f12 on mac) will rotate the emulator

android menu
_ something to bring up the full console window
_ signing tool
_ selection of which avd (emulator), or plugged-in devices (if multiple)

_ change run/present/export/export application names in the menus

_ throw an error if a file in the 'data' dir ends with .gz

CORE (PApplet, P2D et al)

P2 _ too many temporary objects (particularly w/ color) created with A2D
P2 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1399

P3 _ mouseClicked() is currently missing
P3 _   implement tap methods to handle mouseClicked() 
P3 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1406
P3 _ check on multiple pointers and multi-touch
P3 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1491

P4 _ when returning to the application after link(), screen stays blank
P4 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1484
P4 _ excessive rotation of application causes memory to run out
P4 _   this probably means that some memory isn't being freed that should be
P4 _   new window and surfaceview objects are being created in onCreate
P4 _     so they should probably be taken down in onDestroy.. but how?
P4 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1480
P4 _ values for pmouseX/Y aren't great
P4 _   Examples > Topics > Drawing > Continuous Lines shows gaps
P4 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1486

P5 _ Examples > Topics > Effects > Lens uses a ton of memory
P5 _ resize() needs to use the android resize stuff
P5 _   right now using the rather than expensive copy()
P5 _   instead, create a new resized bitmap, and get rid of pixels[]
P5 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1487
P5 _ should alpha PImage stuff use a non-4byte config?

TOOLS 

J only send error text to System.err (i.e. "Launching emulator" is not an error)
J   send these debug log messages to System.out
o "Sketch started on emulator" in spite of the emulator only halfway booted
o   sent email about this one

_ errors in ActivityManager aren't coming through
_ if AVD is deleted while processing still running, things flake out
_   also no error messages, just 'giving up on launching emulator'

// jdf maybedone
_ when out of memory, need an error message to show up in the PDE
_   show "OutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget" in status area
_   Examples > Topics > Drawing > Animator produces:
_   Uncaught handler: thread Animation Thread exiting due to uncaught exception
_   java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget

// jdf maybedone
_ stack overflow produced no error inside the PDE
_   probably same as memory error above

SAVED FOR LATER

_ may need to add screen orientation as a built-in function
_   fairly common to use, and otherwise needs an obscure import

_ possibility of doing a compile (not run) using straight javac?
_   this would be a faster way to check for errors
_   w/o needing to use the incredibly slow android tools

_ maybe the back button shouldn't quit apps, the home button should?

_ should path.reset() or path.rewind() be used for a path to be reused?

_ errors that cause a crash when setting sketchPath
_   seems to be a filesystem that got too full
_   no real signs of what went wrong, but deleting the avd fixed it
_   if it reappears again, trap that condition, and tell the user the fix
