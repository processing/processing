X noLoop() is broken (draw is never called)
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1467
X fix the freakout that happens with onPause()
o   solution is to call stop() to kill the thread, but that's not a pause
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1483
X app not pausing or closing when switching to another activity
X   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1404
o if !looping, is it necessary to call redraw() in onResume()?
X   doesn't appear to be, since it gets completely rebuilt
X bezier curves were broken in A2D
X   extra point is drawn connecting the shape to the corner
X fix other minor bugs in shape drawing
X mask() now implemented in A2D
X updatePixels() now work properly for A2D
X set() should now be working
X using set() on an image that doesn't have a bitmap, or has pixels loaded
X requestImage() now working
X drastically improve the performance of the time functions
X point wasn't detecting different stroke weights
X point wasn't working with strokeWeight > 1
X fix rotate() bug (was using degrees instead of radians)
X arc() now working properly
X createGraphics() works, at least with A2D (or aliases P2D and JAVA2D)

_ Examples > Topics > Effects > Wormhole - needs work, something with resize()
_   resize() needs to use the android resize stuff, rather than expensive copy()

_ make size() work to place the component at the center of the screen
_ make size() work to change the renderer
_ if sketchRenderer() et al are used in android, need to add to desktop

_ PShape examples are totally broken
_ createGraphics() only works with A2D
_   createGraphics() doesn't work w/ arbitrary renderers

cleaning
X move to eclair (donut devices will have terrible performance anyway)
X make change from src folder to assets folder for export
X what to do with other classes that rely on PApplet? (e.g. vida)

android menu
_ reset adb
_ something to bring up the full console window
_ signing tool
_ selection of which avd (emulator), or plugged-in devices (if multiple)
_ run the 'android' application (since users won't be able to find

_ make sure that user can't hit 'Run' several times
_   currently things just keep restarting the build
_ "Sketch started on emulator" in spite of the emulator only halfway booted
_ errors in ActivityManager aren't coming through
_ if AVD is deleted while processing still running, things flake out
_   also no error messages, just 'giving up on launching emulator
_ stack overflow produced no error inside the PDE
_ when out of memory, need an error message to show up in the PDE
_ Examples > Topics > Drawing > Animator produces:
_   Uncaught handler: thread Animation Thread exiting due to uncaught exception
_   java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget
_     at android.graphics.Bitmap.nativeCreate(Native Method)
_ if hitting 'run' in p5, need to kill any sketch that's currently running

_ errors that cause a crash when setting sketchPath
_   seems to be a filesystem that got too full
_   no real signs of what went wrong, but deleting the avd fixed it
_   if it reappears again, trap that condition, and tell the user the fix

_ Errors show up that .java files are duplicates with the Android tools.
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1472

_ don't require JDK installation and PATH setting
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1470
_ remove ANDROID_SDK env variable requirement
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1471
_   ANDROID_SDK doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere anymore
_   this may mean that p5 might just need to get the location
_   though it makes things messier for the build scripts
_ ANDROID_SDK not getting set on OS X
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1469
_   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/603785/environment-variables-in-mac-os-x

_ library support also needs android manifest changes
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1439

_ how does size work? 
_   if size() method is used, things are scaled based on that
_   if no size() method, then the full screen/full resolution is used
_   make apps properly handle screen resize

_ should alpha PImage stuff use a non-4byte config?

_ remove SurfaceView2D/SurfaceView3D separation, or clean up
_ what is resetLights() in PGraphics?
_ remove drawCube() method from PApplet
_ remove model() method from end of PApplet (make it shape(PShape))

from romain
_ colorMode() error 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1436
_ createGraphics() broken
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1437

_ test createFont()

_ gz files not allowed, need to remove the code from createInput() et al
_   or maybe not, since could still come from a site or a File?
_   just can't come from the assets file..
_ throw an error if a file in the 'data' dir ends with .gz

_ add method to set the icon (and package name?)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1429
_   http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/preparing.html
_ need to make data folder copy more efficient than just copying everything
_   right now, first copies to src inside Build.java (which then copies to bin)
X add methods to request rendering
_   need to deal with fps problems with this model
_ check on multiple pointers (peter's msg)
_ add clear and close to all stream methods?
_ is there a way to get a width/height default to use for surfaceChanged?


P1 this is embarrassing, need to fix ASAP
P2 need to fix before beta release
P3 would like to fix before final release
P4 not an immediate need, but very nice to have
P5 nice to have

*---jdf accepts--
| P1 _ get stdout and stderr from the emulator/device

OPTIMIZE

_ don't re-calculate stroke() or fill() when it's the same value

ENHANCEMENTS

_ prevent rotation of applications? (or require a certain orientation)
_   add to activity tag in the manifest:
android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation"
android:screenOrientation="landscape"
_   or programmatically specify:
setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE);
setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);

InputMethodManager imm = 
  (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.showSoftInput(surfaceView, 0);

_ list contents of data folder (assets folder)
      try {
        PApplet.println(assets.list(""));
      } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
      }

_ excessive memory use indicator
_   D/dalvikvm( 1205): GC freed 814 objects / 523352 bytes in 58ms
_   could help show when lots of memory are being used
