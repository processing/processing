[ changes between processing.android.core and processing.core ]

+ For compatability, mouseX and mouseY work similar to the original API, 
  and always contain the most recent mouse position. In addition, the
  motionX, motionY, pmotionX, pmotionY, and motionPressure events can be
  used to track relative motion (the native way Android handles input).
  Unlike mouseX/mouseY, those variables are also float values.

+ The mouseButton variable is not available, for obvious reasions.

+ The keyEvent and mouseEvent variables are not available. If you want to 
  work with event objects, you'll need to override the key and motion handlers:

  public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
    // your code here

    // if you want the variables for motionX/motionY, mouseX/mouseY etc.
    // to work properly, you'll need to call super.onTouchEvent().
    return super.onTouchEvent(event);
  }

  The key methods work in a similar fashion:

  public boolean onKeyDown(int code, KeyEvent event) {
    return super.onKeyDown(code, event);
  }
    
  public boolean onKeyUp(int code, KeyEvent event) {
    return super.onKeyDown(code, event);
  }

  These three functions behave a bit differently than their counterparts in
  java.awt, so make sure you know what you're doing before messing with them.

  The reason that the variables are not kept around is because the KeyEvent
  and MotionEvent objects are reused, which means they can't be reused without
  an expensive clone operation. And because it's so rare that they're used
  in Processing code, it's better to simply remove them and let advanced users
  who would otherwise rely on the events to handle the overrides themselves.

+ Registering methods (registerPost(), registerDraw(), etc) is not supported.
  Too much overhead for too little benefit.

+ All cursor-related methods have been removed. (They don't make sense in 
  a touch-controlled interface.)

+ The all-lowercase version of arraycopy() (deprecated from the desktop version)
  has been removed.

+ The deprecated openStream() method has been removed. Use createInput().

+ PImage.image is PImage.bitmap.

+ Cannot use .gz files in the data or assets folder, because Android wants
  to compress the files itself.
