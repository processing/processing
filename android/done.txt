1) I fixed a bug in the camera handling that a user pointed out recently (http://forum.processing.org/topic/possible-3d-bug). This was a quite urgent issue, since affected pretty much everything. It went unnoticed until now because the math error canceled out with the default camera settings.
2) I also finished the implementation of the getImpl() method in PImage, so it initializes the texture of the new image in A3D mode. This makes the CubicVR example to work fine.
