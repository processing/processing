The majority of the work in this library is done by iText.

The version bundled with previous releases was 2.1.4. After Processing 1.0.9,
the library was downgraded to iText 1.5.4., because later versions seem to
load slower, and don't seem to offer additional benefits. If the PDF library
gets worse, please post a bug and we'll go back to the 2.x release we were
using, or upgrade to the more recent 5.x series.
