/**
 * This example is adapted from Karsten Schmidt's SoftBodySquare example
 */

/* <p>Softbody square demo is showing how to create a 2D square mesh out of
 * verlet particles and make it stable enough to avoid total structural
 * deformation by including an inner skeleton.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage: move mouse to drag/deform the square</p>
