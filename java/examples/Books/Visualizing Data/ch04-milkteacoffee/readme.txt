For this chapter, the sketch used to create each figure is included,
because the figures and steps used to develop the code line up pretty
well. Each sketch has a name like figure_03_labels, which should be 
self-explanatory. (I do not recommend using this ugly style of naming 
for your own sketches, it's done this way simply because the figure 
numbering is relevant and needs to be included). The last two sketches
are called step_16 and step_17 because there was no figure 16 or 17
associated with them.

All examples have been tested but if you find errors of any kind 
(typos, unused variables, profanities in the comments, the usual),
please contact me through http://benfry.com/writing and I'll be happy
to fix the code.
