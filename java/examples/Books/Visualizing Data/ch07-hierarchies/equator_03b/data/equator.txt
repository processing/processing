this
book
is
affectionately
inscribed
to
my
young
friend
harry
rogers
with
recognition
of
what
he
is
and
apprehension
of
what
he
may
become
unless
he
form
himself
a
little
more
closely
upon
the
model
of
the
author
the
pudd'nhead
maxims
these
wisdoms
are
for
the
luring
of
youth
toward
high
moral
altitudes
the
author
did
not
gather
them
from
practice
but
from
observation
to
be
good
is
noble
but
to
show
others
how
to
be
good
is
nobler

no
trouble

the
starting
point
of
this
lecturing
trip
around
the
world
was
paris
where
we
had
been
living
a
year
or
two
we
sailed
for
america
and
there
made
certain
preparations
this
took
but
little
time
two
members
of

family
elected
to
go

dictionary
says
a
carbuncle

humor

we
started
westward
from
new
york
in
midsummer
with
major
pond
to
manage
the
platform
business
as
far
as
the
pacific
it
was
warm
work
all
the
way
and
the
last
fortnight
of
it
was
suffocatingly
smoky
for
in
oregon
and
columbia
the
forest
fires
were
raging
we
had
an
added
week
of
smoke
at
the
seaboard
where
we
were
obliged
awhile
for
our
ship
she
had
been
getting
herself
ashore
in
the
smoke
and
she
had
to
be
docked
and
repaired
we
sailed
at
last
and
so
ended
a
snail
paced
march
across
the
continent
which
had
lasted
forty
days
we
moved
westward
about
mid
afternoon
over
a
rippled
and
summer
sea
an
enticing
sea
a
clean
and
cool
sea
and
apparently
a
welcome
sea
to
all
on
board
it
certainly
was
to
the
distressful
dustings
and
smokings
and
swelterings
of
the
past
weeks
the
voyage
would
furnish
a
three
weeks
holiday
with
hardly
a
break
in
it
we
had
the
whole
pacific
ocean
in
front
of
us
with
nothing
to
do
but
do
nothing
and
be
comfortable
the
city
of
victoria
was
twinkling
dim
in
the
deep
heart
of
her
smoke
cloud
and
getting
ready
to
vanish
and
now
we
closed
the
field
glasses
and
sat
down
on
our
steamer
chairs
contented
and
at
peace
but
they
went
to
wreck
and
ruin
under
us
and
brought
us
to
shame
before
all
the
passengers
they
had
been
furnished
by
the
largest
furniture
dealing
house
in
victoria
and
were
worth
a
couple
of
farthings
a
dozen
though
they
had
cost
us
the
price
of
honest
chairs
in
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
one
must
still
bring
his
own
deck
chair
on
board
or
go
without
just
as
in
the
old
forgotten
atlantic
times
those
dark
ages
of
sea
travel
ours
was
a
reasonably
comfortable
ship
with
the
customary
sea
going
fare
plenty
of
good
food
furnished
by
the
deity
and
cooked
by
the
devil
the
discipline
observable
on
board
was
perhaps
as
good
as
it
is
anywhere
in
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
the
ship
was
not
very
well
arranged
for
tropical
service
but
that
is
nothing
for
this
is
the
rule
for
ships
which
ply
in
the
tropics
she
had
an
over
supply
of
cockroaches
but
this
is
also
the
rule
with
ships
doing
business
in
the
summer
seas
at
least
such
as
have
been
long
in
service
our
young
captain
was
a
very
handsome
man
tall
and
perfectly
formed
the
very
figure
to
show
up
a
smart
uniform's
best
effects
he
was
a
man
of
the
best
intentions
and
was
polite
and
courteous
even
to
courtliness
there
was
a
soft
and
finish
about
his
manners
which
made
whatever
place
he
happened
to
be
in
seem
for
the
moment
a
drawing
room
he
avoided
the
smoking
room
he
had
no
vices
he
did
not
smoke
or
chew
tobacco
or
take
snuff
he
did
not
swear
or
use
slang
or
rude
or
coarse
or
indelicate
language
or
make
puns
or
tell
anecdotes
or
laugh
intemperately
or
raise
his
voice
above
the
moderate
pitch
enjoined
by
the
canons
of
good
form
when
he
gave
an
order
his
manner
modified
it
into
a
request
after
dinner
he
and
his
officers
joined
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
ladies'
saloon
and
shared
in
the
singing
and
piano
playing
and
helped
turn
the
music
he
had
a
sweet
and
sympathetic
tenor
voice
and
used
it
with
taste
and
effect
the
music
he
played
whist
there
always
with
the
same
partner
and
opponents
until
the
ladies'
bedtime
the
electric
lights
burned
there
as
late
as
the
ladies
and
their
friends
might
desire
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
burn
in
the
smoking
room
after
eleven
there
were
many
laws
on
the
ship's
statute
book
of
course
but
so
far
as
i
could
see
this
and
one
other
were
the
only
ones
that
were
rigidly
enforced
the
captain
explained
that
he
enforced
this
one
because
his
own
cabin
adjoined
the
smoking
room
and
the
smell
of
tobacco
smoke
made
him
sick
i
did
not
see
how
our
smoke
could
reach
him
for
the
smoking
room
and
his
cabin
were
on
the
upper
deck
targets
for
all
the
winds
that
blew
and
besides
there
was
no
crack
of
communication
between
them
no
opening
of
any
sort
in
the
solid
intervening
bulkhead
still
to
a
delicate
stomach
even
imaginary
smoke
can
convey
damage
the
captain
with
his
gentle
nature
his
polish
his
sweetness
his
moral
and
verbal
purity
seemed
pathetically
out
of
place
in
his
rude
and
autocratic
vocation
it
seemed
another
instance
of
the
irony
of
fate
he
was
going
home
under
a
cloud
the
passengers
knew
about
his
trouble
and
were
sorry
for
him
approaching
vancouver
through
a
narrow
and
difficult
passage
densely
befogged
with
smoke
from
the
forest
fires
he
had
had
the
ill
luck
to
lose
his
bearings
and
get
his
ship
on
the
rocks
a
matter
like
this
would
rank
merely
as
an
error
with
you
and
me
it
ranks
as
a
crime
with
the
directors
of
steamship
companies
the
captain
had
been
tried
by
the
admiralty
court
at
vancouver
and
its
verdict
had
acquitted
him
of
blame
but
that
was
insufficient
comfort
a
sterner
court
would
examine
the
case
in
sydney
the
court
of
directors
the
lords
of
a
company
in
whose
ships
the
captain
had
served
as
mate
a
number
of
years
this
was
his
first
voyage
as
captain
the
officers
of
our
ship
were
hearty
and
companionable
young
men
and
they
entered
into
the
general
amusements
and
helped
the
passengers
pass
the
time
voyages
in
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
are
but
pleasure
excursions
for
all
hands
our
purser
was
a
young
scotchman
who
was
equipped
with
a
grit
that
was
remarkable
he
was
an
invalid
and
looked
it
as
far
as
his
body
was
concerned
but
illness
could
not
subdue
his
spirit
he
was
full
of
life
and
had
a
gay
and
capable
tongue
to
all
appearances
he
was
a
sick
man
without
being
aware
of
it
for
he
did
not
talk
about
his
ailments
and
his
bearing
and
conduct
were
those
of
a
person
in
robust
health
yet
he
was
the
prey
at
intervals
of
ghastly
sieges
of
pain
in
his
heart
these
lasted
many
hours
and
while
the
attack
continued
he
could
neither
sit
nor
lie
in
one
instance
he
stood
on
his
feet
twenty
four
hours
fighting
for
his
life
with
these
sharp
agonies
and
yet
was
as
full
of
life
and
cheer
and
activity
the
next
day
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
brightest
passenger
in
the
ship
and
the
most
interesting
and
felicitous
talker
was
a
young
canadian
who
was
not
able
to
let
the
whisky
bottle
alone
he
was
of
a
rich
and
powerful
family
and
could
have
had
a
distinguished
career
and
abundance
of
effective
help
toward
it
if
he
could
have
conquered
his
appetite
for
drink
but
he
could
not
do
it
so
his
great
equipment
of
talent
was
of
no
use
to
him
he
had
often
taken
the
pledge
to
drink
no
more
and
was
a
good
sample
of
what
that
sort
of
unwisdom
can
do
for
a
man
for
a
man
with
anything
short
of
an
iron
will
the
system
is
wrong
in
two
ways
it
does
not
strike
at
the
root
of
the
trouble
for
one
thing
and
to
make
a
pledge
of
any
kind
is
to
declare
war
against
nature
for
a
pledge
is
a
chain
that
is
always
clanking
and
reminding
the
wearer
of
it
that
he
is
not
a
free
man
i
have
said
that
the
system
does
not
strike
at
the
root
of
the
trouble
and
i
venture
to
repeat
that
the
root
is
not
the
drinking
but
the
desire
to
drink
these
are
very
different
things
the
one
merely
requires
will
and
a
great
deal
of
it
both
as
to
bulk
and
staying
capacity
the
other
merely
requires
watchfulness
and
for
no
long
time
the
desire
of
course
precedes
the
act
and
should
have
one's
first
attention
it
can
do
but
little
good
to
refuse
the
act
over
and
over
again
always
leaving
the
desire
unmolested
unconquered
the
desire
will
continue
to
assert
itself
and
will
be
almost
sure
to
win
in
the
long
run
when
the
desire
intrudes
it
should
be
at
once
banished
out
of
the
mind
one
should
be
on
the
watch
for
it
all
the
time
otherwise
it
will
get
in
it
must
be
taken
in
time
and
not
allowed
to
get
a
lodgment
a
desire
constantly
repulsed
for
a
fortnight
should
die
then
that
should
cure
the
drinking
habit
the
system
of
refusing
the
mere
act
of
drinking
and
leaving
the
desire
in
full
force
is
unintelligent
war
tactics
it
seems
to
me
i
used
to
take
pledges
and
soon
violate
them
my
will
was
not
strong
and
i
could
not
help
it
and
then
to
be
tied
in
any
way
naturally
irks
an
otherwise
free
person
and
makes
him
chafe
in
his
bonds
and
want
to
get
his
liberty
but
when
i
finally
ceased
from
taking
definite
pledges
and
merely
resolved
that
i
would
kill
an
injurious
desire
but
leave
myself
free
to
resume
the
desire
and
the
habit
whenever
i
should
choose
to
do
so
i
had
no
more
trouble
in
five
days
i
drove
out
the
desire
to
smoke
and
was
not
obliged
to
keep
watch
after
that
and
i
never
experienced
any
strong
desire
to
smoke
again
at
the
end
of
a
year
and
a
quarter
of
idleness
i
began
to
write
a
book
and
presently
found
that
the
pen
was
strangely
reluctant
to
go
i
tried
a
smoke
to
see
if
that
would
help
me
out
of
the
difficulty
it
did
i
smoked
eight
or
ten
cigars
and
as
many
pipes
a
day
for
five
months
finished
the
book
and
did
not
smoke
again
until
a
year
had
gone
by
and
another
book
had
to
be
begun
i
can
quit
any
of
my
nineteen
injurious
habits
at
any
time
and
without
discomfort
or
inconvenience
i
think
that
the
dr
tanners
and
those
others
who
go
forty
days
without
eating
do
it
by
resolutely
keeping
out
the
desire
to
eat
in
the
beginning
and
that
after
a
few
hours
the
desire
is
discouraged
and
comes
no
more
once
i
tried
my
scheme
in
a
large
medical
way
i
had
been
confined
to
my
bed
several
days
with
lumbago
my
case
refused
to
improve
finally
the
doctor
said
my
remedies
have
no
fair
chance
consider
what
they
have
to
fight
besides
the
lumbago
you
smoke
extravagantly
don't
you
yes
you
take
coffee
immoderately
yes
and
some
tea
yes
you
eat
all
kinds
of
things
that
are
dissatisfied
with
each
other's
company
yes
you
drink
two
hot
scotches
every
night
yes
very
well
there
you
see
what
i
have
to
contend
against
we
can't
make
progress
the
way
the
matter
stands
you
must
make
a
reduction
in
these
things
you
must
cut
down
your
consumption
of
them
considerably
for
some
days
i
can't
doctor
why
can't
you
i
lack
the
will
power
i
can
cut
them
off
entirely
but
i
can't
merely
moderate
them
he
said
that
that
would
answer
and
said
he
would
come
around
in
twenty
four
hours
and
begin
work
again
he
was
taken
ill
himself
and
could
not
come
but
i
did
not
need
him
i
cut
off
all
those
things
for
two
days
and
nights
in
fact
i
cut
off
all
kinds
of
food
too
and
all
drinks
except
water
and
at
the
end
of
the
forty
eight
hours
the
lumbago
was
discouraged
and
left
me
i
was
a
well
man
so
i
gave
thanks
and
took
to
those
delicacies
again
it
seemed
a
valuable
medical
course
and
i
recommended
it
to
a
lady
she
had
run
down
and
down
and
down
and
had
at
last
reached
a
point
where
medicines
no
longer
had
any
helpful
effect
upon
her
i
said
i
knew
i
could
put
her
upon
her
feet
in
a
week
it
brightened
her
up
it
filled
her
with
hope
and
she
said
she
would
do
everything
i
told
her
to
do
so
i
said
she
must
stop
swearing
and
drinking
and
smoking
and
eating
for
four
days
and
then
she
would
be
all
right
again
and
it
would
have
happened
just
so
i
know
it
but
she
said
she
could
not
stop
swearing
and
smoking
and
drinking
because
she
had
never
done
those
things
so
there
it
was
she
had
neglected
her
habits
and
hadn't
any
now
that
they
would
have
come
good
there
were
none
in
stock
she
had
nothing
to
fall
back
on
she
was
a
sinking
vessel
with
no
freight
in
her
to
throw
over
lighten
ship
withal
why
even
one
or
two
little
bad
habits
could
have
saved
her
but
she
was
just
a
moral
pauper
when
she
could
have
acquired
them
she
was
dissuaded
by
her
parents
who
were
ignorant
people
though
reared
in
the
best
society
and
it
was
too
late
to
begin
now
it
seemed
such
a
pity
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
these
things
ought
to
be
attended
to
while
a
person
is
young
otherwise
when
age
and
disease
come
there
is
nothing
effectual
to
fight
them
with
when
i
was
a
youth
i
used
to
take
all
kinds
of
pledges
and
do
my
best
to
keep
them
but
i
never
could
because
i
didn't
strike
at
the
root
of
the
habit
the
desire
i
generally
broke
down
within
the
month
once
i
tried
limiting
a
habit
that
worked
tolerably
well
for
a
while
i
pledged
myself
to
smoke
but
one
cigar
a
day
i
kept
the
cigar
waiting
until
bedtime
then
i
had
a
luxurious
time
with
it
but
desire
persecuted
me
every
day
and
all
day
long
so
within
the
week
i
found
myself
hunting
for
larger
cigars
than
i
had
been
used
to
smoke
then
larger
ones
still
and
still
larger
ones
within
the
fortnight
i
was
getting
cigars
made
for
me
on
a
yet
larger
pattern
they
still
grew
and
grew
in
size
within
the
month
my
cigar
had
grown
to
such
proportions
that
i
could
have
used
it
as
a
crutch
it
now
seemed
to
me
that
a
one
cigar
limit
was
no
real
protection
to
a
person
so
i
knocked
my
pledge
on
the
head
and
resumed
my
liberty
to
go
back
to
that
young
canadian
he
was
a
remittance
man
the
first
one
i
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
passengers
explained
the
term
to
me
they
said
that
dissipated
ne'er
do
wells
belonging
to
important
families
in
england
and
canada
were
not
cast
off
by
their
people
while
there
was
any
hope
of
reforming
them
but
when
that
last
hope
perished
at
last
the
ne'er
do
well
was
sent
abroad
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
he
was
shipped
off
with
just
enough
money
in
his
pocket
no
in
the
purser's
pocket
for
the
needs
of
the
voyage
and
when
he
reached
his
destined
port
he
would
find
a
remittance
awaiting
him
there
not
a
large
one
but
just
enough
to
keep
him
a
month
a
similar
remittance
would
come
monthly
thereafter
it
was
the
remittance
man's
custom
to
pay
his
month's
board
and
lodging
straightway
a
duty
which
his
landlord
did
not
allow
him
to
forget
then
spree
away
the
rest
of
his
money
in
a
single
night
then
brood
and
mope
and
grieve
in
idleness
till
the
next
remittance
came
it
is
a
pathetic
life
we
had
other
remittance
men
on
board
it
was
said
at
least
they
said
they
were
r
m
's
there
were
two
but
they
did
not
resemble
the
canadian
they
lacked
his
tidiness
and
his
brains
and
his
gentlemanly
ways
and
his
resolute
spirit
and
his
humanities
and
generosities
one
of
them
was
a
lad
of
nineteen
or
twenty
and
he
was
a
good
deal
of
a
ruin
as
to
clothes
and
morals
and
general
aspect
he
said
he
was
a
scion
of
a
ducal
house
in
england
and
had
been
shipped
to
canada
for
the
house's
relief
that
he
had
fallen
into
trouble
there
and
was
now
being
shipped
to
australia
he
said
he
had
no
title
beyond
this
remark
he
was
economical
of
the
truth
the
first
thing
he
did
in
australia
was
to
get
into
the
lockup
and
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
proclaim
himself
an
earl
in
the
police
court
in
the
morning
and
fail
to
prove
it

pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
about
four
days
out
from
victoria
we
plunged
into
hot
weather
and
all
the
male
passengers
put
on
white
linen
clothes
one
or
two
days
later
we
crossed
the
25th
parallel
of
north
latitude
and
then
by
order
the
officers
of
the
ship
laid
away
their
blue
uniforms
and
came
out
in
white
linen
ones
all
the
ladies
were
in
white
by
this
time
this
prevalence
of
snowy
costumes
gave
the
promenade
deck
an
invitingly
cool
and
cheerful
and
picnicky
aspect
from
my
diary
there
are
several
sorts
of
ills
in
the
world
from
which
a
person
can
never
escape
altogether
let
him
journey
as
far
as
he
will
one
escapes
from
one
breed
of
an
ill
only
to
encounter
another
breed
of
it
we
have
come
far
from
the
snake
liar
and
the
fish
liar
and
there
was
rest
and
peace
in
the
thought
but
now
we
have
reached
the
realm
of
the
boomerang
liar
and
sorrow
is
with
us
once
more
the
first
officer
has
seen
a
man
try
to
escape
from
his
enemy
by
getting
behind
a
tree
but
the
enemy
sent
his
boomerang
sailing
into
the
sky
far
above
and
beyond
the
tree
then
it
turned
descended
and
killed
the
man
the
australian
passenger
has
seen
this
thing
done
to
two
men
behind
two
trees
and
by
the
one
arrow
this
being
received
with
a
large
silence
that
suggested
doubt
he
buttressed
it
with
the
statement
that
his
brother
once
saw
the
boomerang
kill
a
bird
away
off
a
hundred
yards
and
bring
it
to
the
thrower
but
these
are
ills
which
must
be
borne
there
is
no
other
way
the
talk
passed
from
the
boomerang
to
dreams
usually
a
fruitful
subject
afloat
or
ashore
but
this
time
the
output
was
poor
then
it
passed
to
instances
of
extraordinary
memory
with
better
results
blind
tom
the
negro
pianist
was
spoken
of
and
it
was
said
that
he
could
accurately
play
any
piece
of
music
howsoever
long
and
difficult
after
hearing
it
once
and
that
six
months
later
he
could
accurately
play
it
again
without
having
touched
it
in
the
interval
one
of
the
most
striking
of
the
stories
told
was
furnished
by
a
gentleman
who
had
served
on
the
staff
of
the
viceroy
of
india
he
read
the
details
from
his
note
book
and
explained
that
he
had
written
them
down
right
after
the
consummation
of
the
incident
which
they
described
because
he
thought
that
if
he
did
not
put
them
down
in
black
and
white
he
might
presently
come
to
think
he
had
dreamed
them
or
invented
them
the
viceroy
was
making
a
progress
and
among
the
shows
offered
by
the
maharajah
of
mysore
for
his
entertainment
was
a
memory
exhibition
the
viceroy
and
thirty
gentlemen
of
his
suite
sat
in
a
row
and
the
memory
expert
a
high
caste
brahmin
was
brought
in
and
seated
on
the
floor
in
front
of
them
he
said
he
knew
but
two
languages
the
english
and
his
own
but
would
not
exclude
any
foreign
tongue
from
the
tests
to
be
applied
to
his
memory
then
he
laid
before
the
assemblage
his
program
a
sufficiently
extraordinary
one
he
proposed
that
one
gentleman
should
give
him
one
word
of
a
foreign
sentence
and
tell
him
its
place
in
the
sentence
he
was
furnished
with
the
french
word
'est'
and
was
told
it
was
second
in
a
sentence
of
three
words
the
next
gentleman
gave
him
the
german
word
'verloren'
and
said
it
was
the
third
in
a
sentence
of
four
words
he
asked
the
next
gentleman
for
one
detail
in
a
sum
in
addition
another
for
one
detail
in
a
sum
of
subtraction
others
for
single
details
in
mathematical
problems
of
various
kinds
he
got
them
intermediates
gave
him
single
words
from
sentences
in
greek
latin
spanish
portuguese
italian
and
other
languages
and
told
him
their
places
in
the
sentences
when
at
last
everybody
had
furnished
him
a
single
rag
from
a
foreign
sentence
or
a
figure
from
a
problem
he
went
over
the
ground
again
and
got
a
second
word
and
a
second
figure
and
was
told
their
places
in
the
sentences
and
the
sums
and
so
on
and
so
on
he
went
over
the
ground
again
and
again
until
he
had
collected
all
the
parts
of
the
sums
and
all
the
parts
of
the
sentences
and
all
in
disorder
of
course
not
in
their
proper
rotation
this
had
occupied
two
hours
the
brahmin
now
sat
silent
and
thinking
a
while
then
began
and
repeated
all
the
sentences
placing
the
words
in
their
proper
order
and
untangled
the
disordered
arithmetical
problems
and
gave
accurate
answers
to
them
all
in
the
beginning
he
had
asked
the
company
to
throw
almonds
at
him
during
the
two
hours
he
to
remember
how
many
each
gentleman
had
thrown
but
none
were
thrown
for
the
viceroy
said
that
the
test
would
be
a
sufficiently
severe
strain
without
adding
that
burden
to
it
general
grant
had
a
fine
memory
for
all
kinds
of
things
including
even
names
and
faces
and
i
could
have
furnished
an
instance
of
it
if
i
had
thought
of
it
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
was
early
in
his
first
term
as
president
i
had
just
arrived
in
washington
from
the
pacific
coast
a
stranger
and
wholly
unknown
to
the
public
and
was
passing
the
white
house
one
morning
when
i
met
a
friend
a
senator
from
nevada
he
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
see
the
president
i
said
i
should
be
very
glad
so
we
entered
i
supposed
that
the
president
would
be
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
and
that
i
could
look
at
him
in
peace
and
security
from
a
distance
as
another
stray
cat
might
look
at
another
king
but
it
was
in
the
morning
and
the
senator
was
using
a
privilege
of
his
office
which
i
had
not
heard
of
the
privilege
of
intruding
upon
the
chief
magistrate's
working
hours
before
i
knew
it
the
senator
and
i
were
in
the
presence
and
there
was
none
there
but
we
three
general
grant
got
slowly
up
from
his
table
put
his
pen
down
and
stood
before
me
with
the
iron
expression
of
a
man
who
had
not
smiled
for
seven
years
and
was
not
intending
to
smile
for
another
seven
he
looked
me
steadily
in
the
eyes
mine
lost
confidence
and
fell
i
had
never
confronted
a
great
man
before
and
was
in
a
miserable
state
of
funk
and
inefficiency
the
senator
said
mr
president
may
i
have
the
privilege
of
introducing
mr
clemens
the
president
gave
my
hand
an
unsympathetic
wag
and
dropped
it
he
did
not
say
a
word
but
just
stood
in
my
trouble
i
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
i
merely
wanted
to
resign
there
was
an
awkward
pause
a
dreary
pause
a
horrible
pause
then
i
thought
of
something
and
looked
up
into
that
unyielding
face
and
said
timidly
mr
president
i
i
am
embarrassed
are
you
his
face
broke
just
a
little
a
wee
glimmer
the
momentary
flicker
of
a
summer
lightning
smile
seven
years
ahead
of
time
and
i
was
out
and
gone
as
soon
as
it
was
ten
years
passed
away
before
i
saw
him
the
second
time
meantime
i
was
become
better
known
and
was
one
of
the
people
appointed
to
respond
to
toasts
at
the
banquet
given
to
general
grant
in
chicago
by
the
army
of
the
tennessee
when
he
came
back
from
his
tour
around
the
world
i
arrived
late
at
night
and
got
up
late
in
the
morning
all
the
corridors
of
the
hotel
were
crowded
with
people
waiting
to
get
a
glimpse
of
general
grant
when
he
should
pass
to
the
place
whence
he
was
to
review
the
great
procession
i
worked
my
way
by
the
suite
of
packed
drawing
rooms
and
at
the
corner
of
the
house
i
found
a
window
open
where
there
was
a
roomy
platform
decorated
with
flags
and
carpeted
i
stepped
out
on
it
and
saw
below
me
millions
of
people
blocking
all
the
streets
and
other
millions
caked
together
in
all
the
windows
and
on
all
the
house
tops
around
these
masses
took
me
for
general
grant
and
broke
into
volcanic
explosions
and
cheers
but
it
was
a
good
place
to
see
the
procession
and
i
stayed
presently
i
heard
the
distant
blare
of
military
music
and
far
up
the
street
i
saw
the
procession
come
in
sight
cleaving
its
way
through
the
huzzaing
multitudes
with
sheridan
the
most
martial
figure
of
the
war
riding
at
its
head
in
the
dress
uniform
of
a
lieutenant
general
and
now
general
grant
arm
in
arm
with
major
carter
harrison
stepped
out
on
the
platform
followed
two
and
two
by
the
badged
and
uniformed
reception
committee
general
grant
was
looking
exactly
as
he
had
looked
upon
that
trying
occasion
of
ten
years
before
all
iron
and
bronze
self
possession
mr
harrison
came
over
and
led
me
to
the
general
and
formally
introduced
me
before
i
could
put
together
the
proper
remark
general
grant
said
mr
clemens
i
am
not
embarrassed
are
you
and
that
little
seven
year
smile
twinkled
across
his
face
again
seventeen
years
have
gone
by
since
then
and
to
day
in
new
york
the
streets
are
a
crush
of
people
who
are
there
to
honor
the
remains
of
the
great
soldier
as
they
pass
to
their
final
resting
place
under
the
monument
and
the
air
is
heavy
with
dirges
and
the
boom
of
artillery
and
all
the
millions
of
america
are
thinking
of
the
man
who
restored
the
union
and
the
flag
and
gave
to
democratic
government
a
new
lease
of
life
and
as
we
may
hope
and
do
believe
a
permanent
place
among
the
beneficent
institutions
of
men
we
had
one
game
in
the
ship
which
was
a
good
time
passer
at
least
it
was
at
night
in
the
smoking
room
when
the
men
were
getting
freshened
up
from
the
day's
monotonies
and
dullnesses
it
was
the
completing
of
non
complete
stories
that
is
to
say
a
man
would
tell
all
of
a
story
except
the
finish
then
the
others
would
try
to
supply
the
ending
out
of
their
own
invention
when
every
one
who
wanted
a
chance
had
had
it
the
man
who
had
introduced
the
story
would
give
it
its
original
ending
then
you
could
take
your
choice
sometimes
the
new
endings
turned
out
to
be
better
than
the
old
one
but
the
story
which
called
out
the
most
persistent
and
determined
and
ambitious
effort
was
one
which
had
no
ending
and
so
there
was
nothing
to
compare
the
new
made
endings
with
the
man
who
told
it
said
he
could
furnish
the
particulars
up
to
a
certain
point
only
because
that
was
as
much
of
the
tale
as
he
knew
he
had
read
it
in
a
volume
of
`sketches
twenty
five
years
ago
and
was
interrupted
before
the
end
was
reached
he
would
give
any
one
fifty
dollars
who
would
finish
the
story
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
jury
to
be
appointed
by
ourselves
we
appointed
a
jury
and
wrestled
with
the
tale
we
invented
plenty
of
endings
but
the
jury
voted
them
all
down
the
jury
was
right
it
was
a
tale
which
the
author
of
it
may
possibly
have
completed
satisfactorily
and
if
he
really
had
that
good
fortune
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
ending
was
any
ordinary
man
will
find
that
the
story's
strength
is
in
its
middle
and
that
there
is
apparently
no
way
to
transfer
it
to
the
close
where
of
course
it
ought
to
be
in
substance
the
storiette
was
as
follows
john
brown
aged
thirty
one
good
gentle
bashful
timid
lived
in
a
quiet
village
in
missouri
he
was
superintendent
of
the
presbyterian
sunday
school
it
was
but
a
humble
distinction
still
it
was
his
only
official
one
and
he
was
modestly
proud
of
it
and
was
devoted
to
its
work
and
its
interests
the
extreme
kindliness
of
his
nature
was
recognized
by
all
in
fact
people
said
that
he
was
made
entirely
out
of
good
impulses
and
bashfulness
that
he
could
always
be
counted
upon
for
help
when
it
was
needed
and
for
bashfulness
both
when
it
was
needed
and
when
it
wasn't
mary
taylor
twenty
three
modest
sweet
winning
and
in
character
and
person
beautiful
was
all
in
all
to
him
and
he
was
very
nearly
all
in
all
to
her
she
was
wavering
his
hopes
were
high
her
mother
had
been
in
opposition
from
the
first
but
she
was
wavering
too
he
could
see
it
she
was
being
touched
by
his
warm
interest
in
her
two
charity
proteges
and
by
his
contributions
toward
their
support
these
were
two
forlorn
and
aged
sisters
who
lived
in
a
log
hut
in
a
lonely
place
up
a
cross
road
four
miles
from
mrs
taylor's
farm
one
of
the
sisters
was
crazy
and
sometimes
a
little
violent
but
not
often
at
last
the
time
seemed
ripe
for
a
final
advance
and
brown
gathered
his
courage
together
and
resolved
to
make
it
he
would
take
along
a
contribution
of
double
the
usual
size
and
win
the
mother
over
with
her
opposition
annulled
the
rest
of
the
conquest
would
be
sure
and
prompt
he
took
to
the
road
in
the
middle
of
a
placid
sunday
afternoon
in
the
soft
missourian
summer
and
he
was
equipped
properly
for
his
mission
he
was
clothed
all
in
white
linen
with
a
blue
ribbon
for
a
necktie
and
he
had
on
dressy
tight
boots
his
horse
and
buggy
were
the
finest
that
the
livery
stable
could
furnish
the
lap
robe
was
of
white
linen
it
was
new
and
it
had
a
hand
worked
border
that
could
not
be
rivaled
in
that
region
for
beauty
and
elaboration
when
he
was
four
miles
out
on
the
lonely
road
and
was
walking
his
horse
over
a
wooden
bridge
his
straw
hat
blew
off
and
fell
in
the
creek
and
floated
down
and
lodged
against
a
bar
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
he
must
have
the
hat
that
was
manifest
but
how
was
he
to
get
it
then
he
had
an
idea
the
roads
were
empty
nobody
was
stirring
yes
he
would
risk
it
he
led
the
horse
to
the
roadside
and
set
it
to
cropping
the
grass
then
he
undressed
and
put
his
clothes
in
the
buggy
petted
the
horse
a
moment
to
secure
its
compassion
and
its
loyalty
then
hurried
to
the
stream
he
swam
out
and
soon
had
the
hat
when
he
got
to
the
top
of
the
bank
the
horse
was
gone!
his
legs
almost
gave
way
under
him
the
horse
was
walking
leisurely
along
the
road
brown
trotted
after
it
saying
whoa
whoa
there's
a
good
fellow
but
whenever
he
got
near
enough
to
chance
a
jump
for
the
buggy
the
horse
quickened
its
pace
a
little
and
defeated
him
and
so
this
went
on
the
naked
man
perishing
with
anxiety
and
expecting
every
moment
to
see
people
come
in
sight
he
tagged
on
and
on
imploring
the
horse
beseeching
the
horse
till
he
had
left
a
mile
behind
him
and
was
closing
up
on
the
taylor
premises
then
at
last
he
was
successful
and
got
into
the
buggy
he
flung
on
his
shirt
his
necktie
and
his
coat
then
reached
for
but
he
was
too
late
he
sat
suddenly
down
and
pulled
up
the
lap
robe
for
he
saw
some
one
coming
out
of
the
gate
a
woman
he
thought
he
wheeled
the
horse
to
the
left
and
struck
briskly
up
the
cross
road
it
was
perfectly
straight
and
exposed
on
both
sides
but
there
were
woods
and
a
sharp
turn
three
miles
ahead
and
he
was
very
grateful
when
he
got
there
as
he
passed
around
the
turn
he
slowed
down
to
a
walk
and
reached
for
his
tr
too
late
again
he
had
come
upon
mrs
enderby
mrs
glossop
mrs
taylor
and
mary
they
were
on
foot
and
seemed
tired
and
excited
they
came
at
once
to
the
buggy
and
shook
hands
and
all
spoke
at
once
and
said
eagerly
and
earnestly
how
glad
they
were
that
he
was
come
and
how
fortunate
it
was
and
mrs
enderby
said
impressively
it
looks
like
an
accident
his
coming
at
such
a
time
but
let
no
one
profane
it
with
such
a
name
he
was
sent
sent
from
on
high
they
were
all
moved
and
mrs
glossop
said
in
an
awed
voice
sarah
enderby
you
never
said
a
truer
word
in
your
life
this
is
no
accident
it
is
a
special
providence
he
was
sent
he
is
an
angel
an
angel
as
truly
as
ever
angel
was
an
angel
of
deliverance
i
say
angel
sarah
enderby
and
will
have
no
other
word
don't
let
any
one
ever
say
to
me
again
that
there's
no
such
thing
as
special
providences
for
if
this
isn't
one
let
them
account
for
it
that
can
i
know
it's
so
said
mrs
taylor
fervently
john
brown
i
could
worship
you
i
could
go
down
on
my
knees
to
you
didn't
something
tell
you
didn't
you
feel
that
you
were
sent
i
could
kiss
the
hem
of
your
laprobe
he
was
not
able
to
speak
he
was
helpless
with
shame
and
fright
mrs
taylor
went
on
why
just
look
at
it
all
around
julia
glossop
any
person
can
see
the
hand
of
providence
in
it
here
at
noon
what
do
we
see
we
see
the
smoke
rising
i
speak
up
and
say
'that's
the
old
people's
cabin
afire
'
didn't
i
julia
glossop
the
very
words
you
said
nancy
taylor
i
was
as
close
to
you
as
i
am
now
and
i
heard
them
you
may
have
said
hut
instead
of
cabin
but
in
substance
it's
the
same
and
you
were
looking
pale
too
pale
i
was
that
pale
that
if
why
you
just
compare
it
with
this
laprobe
then
the
next
thing
i
said
was
'mary
taylor
tell
the
hired
man
to
rig
up
the
team
we'll
go
to
the
rescue
'
and
she
said
'mother
don't
you
know
you
told
him
he
could
drive
to
see
his
people
and
stay
over
sunday
'
and
it
was
just
so
i
declare
for
it
i
had
forgotten
it
'then
'
said
i
'we'll
go
afoot
'
and
go
we
did
and
found
sarah
enderby
on
the
road
and
we
all
went
together
said
mrs
enderby
and
found
the
cabin
set
fire
to
and
burnt
down
by
the
crazy
one
and
the
poor
old
things
so
old
and
feeble
that
they
couldn't
go
afoot
and
we
got
them
to
a
shady
place
and
made
them
as
comfortable
as
we
could
and
began
to
wonder
which
way
to
turn
to
find
some
way
to
get
them
conveyed
to
nancy
taylor's
house
and
i
spoke
up
and
said
now
what
did
i
say
didn't
i
say
'providence
will
provide'
why
sure
as
you
live
so
you
did!
i
had
forgotten
it
so
had
i
said
mrs
glossop
and
mrs
taylor
but
you
certainly
said
it
now
wasn't
that
remarkable
yes
i
said
it
and
then
we
went
to
mr
moseley's
two
miles
and
all
of
them
were
gone
to
the
camp
meeting
over
on
stony
fork
and
then
we
came
all
the
way
back
two
miles
and
then
here
another
mile
and
providence
has
provided
you
see
it
yourselves
they
gazed
at
each
other
awe
struck
and
lifted
their
hands
and
said
in
unison
it's
per
fectly
wonderful
and
then
said
mrs
glossop
what
do
you
think
we
had
better
do
let
mr
brown
drive
the
old
people
to
nancy
taylor's
one
at
a
time
or
put
both
of
them
in
the
buggy
and
him
lead
the
horse
brown
gasped
now
then
that's
a
question
said
mrs
enderby
you
see
we
are
all
tired
out
and
any
way
we
fix
it
it's
going
to
be
difficult
for
if
mr
brown
takes
both
of
them
at
least
one
of
us
must
go
back
to
help
him
for
he
can't
load
them
into
the
buggy
by
himself
and
they
so
helpless
that
is
so
said
mrs
taylor
it
doesn't
look
oh
how
would
this
do
one
of
us
drive
there
with
mr
brown
and
the
rest
of
you
go
along
to
my
house
and
get
things
ready
i'll
go
with
him
he
and
i
together
can
lift
one
of
the
old
people
into
the
buggy
then
drive
her
to
my
house
and
but
who
will
take
care
of
the
other
one
said
mrs
enderby
we
musn't
leave
her
there
in
the
woods
alone
you
know
especially
the
crazy
one
there
and
back
is
eight
miles
you
see
they
had
all
been
sitting
on
the
grass
beside
the
buggy
for
a
while
now
trying
to
rest
their
weary
bodies
they
fell
silent
a
moment
or
two
and
struggled
in
thought
over
the
baffling
situation
then
mrs
enderby
brightened
and
said
i
think
i've
got
the
idea
now
you
see
we
can't
walk
any
more
think
what
we've
done
four
miles
there
two
to
moseley's
is
six
then
back
to
here
nine
miles
since
noon
and
not
a
bite
to
eat
i
declare
i
don't
see
how
we've
done
it
and
as
for
me
i
am
just
famishing
now
somebody's
got
to
go
back
to
help
mr
brown
there's
no
getting
mound
that
but
whoever
goes
has
got
to
ride
not
walk
so
my
idea
is
this
one
of
us
to
ride
back
with
mr
brown
then
ride
to
nancy
taylor's
house
with
one
of
the
old
people
leaving
mr
brown
to
keep
the
other
old
one
company
you
all
to
go
now
to
nancy's
and
rest
and
wait
then
one
of
you
drive
back
and
get
the
other
one
and
drive
her
to
nancy's
and
mr
brown
walk
splendid!
they
all
cried
oh
that
will
do
that
will
answer
perfectly
and
they
all
said
that
mrs
enderby
had
the
best
head
for
planning
in
the
company
and
they
said
that
they
wondered
that
they
hadn't
thought
of
this
simple
plan
themselves
they
hadn't
meant
to
take
back
the
compliment
good
simple
souls
and
didn't
know
they
had
done
it
after
a
consultation
it
was
decided
that
mrs
enderby
should
drive
back
with
brown
she
being
entitled
to
the
distinction
because
she
had
invented
the
plan
everything
now
being
satisfactorily
arranged
and
settled
the
ladies
rose
relieved
and
happy
and
brushed
down
their
gowns
and
three
of
them
started
homeward
mrs
enderby
set
her
foot
on
the
buggy
step
and
was
about
to
climb
in
when
brown
found
a
remnant
of
his
voice
and
gasped
out
please
mrs
enderby
call
them
back
i
am
very
weak
i
can't
walk
i
can't
indeed
why
dear
mr
brown!
you
do
look
pale
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
that
i
didn't
notice
it
sooner
come
back
all
of
you!
mr
brown
is
not
well
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
mr
brown
i'm
real
sorry
are
you
in
pain
no
madam
only
weak
i
am
not
sick
but
only
just
weak
lately
not
long
but
just
lately
the
others
came
back
and
poured
out
their
sympathies
and
commiserations
and
were
full
of
self
reproaches
for
not
having
noticed
how
pale
he
was
and
they
at
once
struck
out
a
new
plan
and
soon
agreed
that
it
was
by
far
the
best
of
all
they
would
all
go
to
nancy
taylor's
house
and
see
to
brown's
needs
first
he
could
lie
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlor
and
while
mrs
taylor
and
mary
took
care
of
him
the
other
two
ladies
would
take
the
buggy
and
go
and
get
one
of
the
old
people
and
leave
one
of
themselves
with
the
other
one
and
by
this
time
without
any
solicitation
they
were
at
the
horse's
head
and
were
beginning
to
turn
him
around
the
danger
was
imminent
but
brown
found
his
voice
again
and
saved
himself
he
said
but
ladies
you
are
overlooking
something
which
makes
the
plan
impracticable
you
see
if
you
bring
one
of
them
home
and
one
remains
behind
with
the
other
there
will
be
three
persons
there
when
one
of
you
comes
back
for
that
other
for
some
one
must
drive
the
buggy
back
and
three
can't
come
home
in
it
they
all
exclaimed
why
sure
ly
that
is
so!
and
they
were
all
perplexed
again
dear
dear
what
can
we
do
said
mrs
glossop
it
is
the
most
mixed
up
thing
that
ever
was
the
fox
and
the
goose
and
the
corn
and
things
oh
dear
they
are
nothing
to
it
they
sat
wearily
down
once
more
to
further
torture
their
tormented
heads
for
a
plan
that
would
work
presently
mary
offered
a
plan
it
was
her
first
effort
she
said
i
am
young
and
strong
and
am
refreshed
now
take
mr
brown
to
our
house
and
give
him
help
you
see
how
plainly
he
needs
it
i
will
go
back
and
take
care
of
the
old
people
i
can
be
there
in
twenty
minutes
you
can
go
on
and
do
what
you
first
started
to
do
wait
on
the
main
road
at
our
house
until
somebody
comes
along
with
a
wagon
then
send
and
bring
away
the
three
of
us
you
won't
have
to
wait
long
the
farmers
will
soon
be
coming
back
from
town
now
i
will
keep
old
polly
patient
and
cheered
up
the
crazy
one
doesn't
need
it
this
plan
was
discussed
and
accepted
it
seemed
the
best
that
could
be
done
in
the
circumstances
and
the
old
people
must
be
getting
discouraged
by
this
time
brown
felt
relieved
and
was
deeply
thankful
let
him
once
get
to
the
main
road
and
he
would
find
a
way
to
escape
then
mrs
taylor
said
the
evening
chill
will
be
coming
on
pretty
soon
and
those
poor
old
burnt
out
things
will
need
some
kind
of
covering
take
the
lap
robe
with
you
dear
very
well
mother
i
will
she
stepped
to
the
buggy
and
put
out
her
hand
to
take
it
that
was
the
end
of
the
tale
the
passenger
who
told
it
said
that
when
he
read
the
story
twenty
five
years
ago
in
a
train
he
was
interrupted
at
that
point
the
train
jumped
off
a
bridge
at
first
we
thought
we
could
finish
the
story
quite
easily
and
we
set
to
work
with
confidence
but
it
soon
began
to
appear
that
it
was
not
a
simple
thing
but
difficult
and
baffling
this
was
on
account
of
brown's
character
great
generosity
and
kindliness
but
complicated
with
unusual
shyness
and
diffidence
particularly
in
the
presence
of
ladies
there
was
his
love
for
mary
in
a
hopeful
state
but
not
yet
secure
just
in
a
condition
indeed
where
its
affair
must
be
handled
with
great
tact
and
no
mistakes
made
no
offense
given
and
there
was
the
mother
wavering
half
willing
by
adroit
and
flawless
diplomacy
to
be
won
over
now
or
perhaps
never
at
all
also
there
were
the
helpless
old
people
yonder
in
the
woods
waiting
their
fate
and
brown's
happiness
to
be
determined
by
what
brown
should
do
within
the
next
two
seconds
mary
was
reaching
for
the
lap
robe
brown
must
decide
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
of
course
none
but
a
happy
ending
of
the
story
would
be
accepted
by
the
jury
the
finish
must
find
brown
in
high
credit
with
the
ladies
his
behavior
without
blemish
his
modesty
unwounded
his
character
for
self
sacrifice
maintained
the
old
people
rescued
through
him
their
benefactor
all
the
party
proud
of
him
happy
in
him
his
praises
on
all
their
tongues
we
tried
to
arrange
this
but
it
was
beset
with
persistent
and
irreconcilable
difficulties
we
saw
that
brown's
shyness
would
not
allow
him
to
give
up
the
lap
robe
this
would
offend
mary
and
her
mother
and
it
would
surprise
the
other
ladies
partly
because
this
stinginess
toward
the
suffering
old
people
would
be
out
of
character
with
brown
and
partly
because
he
was
a
special
providence
and
could
not
properly
act
so
if
asked
to
explain
his
conduct
his
shyness
would
not
allow
him
to
tell
the
truth
and
lack
of
invention
and
practice
would
find
him
incapable
of
contriving
a
lie
that
would
wash
we
worked
at
the
troublesome
problem
until
three
in
the
morning
meantime
mary
was
still
reaching
for
the
lap
robe
we
gave
it
up
and
decided
to
let
her
continue
to
reach
it
is
the
reader's
privilege
to
determine
for
himself
how
the
thing
came
out
chapter
iii
it
is
more
trouble
to
make
a
maxim
than
it
is
to
do
right
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
on
the
seventh
day
out
we
saw
a
dim
vast
bulk
standing
up
out
of
the
wastes
of
the
pacific
and
knew
that
that
spectral
promontory
was
diamond
head
a
piece
of
this
world
which
i
had
not
seen
before
for
twenty
nine
years
so
we
were
nearing
honolulu
the
capital
city
of
the
sandwich
islands
those
islands
which
to
me
were
paradise
a
paradise
which
i
had
been
longing
all
those
years
to
see
again
not
any
other
thing
in
the
world
could
have
stirred
me
as
the
sight
of
that
great
rock
did
in
the
night
we
anchored
a
mile
from
shore
through
my
port
i
could
see
the
twinkling
lights
of
honolulu
and
the
dark
bulk
of
the
mountain
range
that
stretched
away
right
and
left
i
could
not
make
out
the
beautiful
nuuana
valley
but
i
knew
where
it
lay
and
remembered
how
it
used
to
look
in
the
old
times
we
used
to
ride
up
it
on
horseback
in
those
days
we
young
people
and
branch
off
and
gather
bones
in
a
sandy
region
where
one
of
the
first
kamehameha's
battles
was
fought
he
was
a
remarkable
man
for
a
king
and
he
was
also
a
remarkable
man
for
a
savage
he
was
a
mere
kinglet
and
of
little
or
no
consequence
at
the
time
of
captain
cook's
arrival
in
1788
but
about
four
years
afterward
he
conceived
the
idea
of
enlarging
his
sphere
of
influence
that
is
a
courteous
modern
phrase
which
means
robbing
your
neighbor
for
your
neighbor's
benefit
and
the
great
theater
of
its
benevolences
is
africa
kamehameha
went
to
war
and
in
the
course
of
ten
years
he
whipped
out
all
the
other
kings
and
made
himself
master
of
every
one
of
the
nine
or
ten
islands
that
form
the
group
but
he
did
more
than
that
he
bought
ships
freighted
them
with
sandal
wood
and
other
native
products
and
sent
them
as
far
as
south
america
and
china
he
sold
to
his
savages
the
foreign
stuffs
and
tools
and
utensils
which
came
back
in
these
ships
and
started
the
march
of
civilization
it
is
doubtful
if
the
match
to
this
extraordinary
thing
is
to
be
found
in
the
history
of
any
other
savage
savages
are
eager
to
learn
from
the
white
man
any
new
way
to
kill
each
other
but
it
is
not
their
habit
to
seize
with
avidity
and
apply
with
energy
the
larger
and
nobler
ideas
which
he
offers
them
the
details
of
kamehameha's
history
show
that
he
was
always
hospitably
ready
to
examine
the
white
man's
ideas
and
that
he
exercised
a
tidy
discrimination
in
making
his
selections
from
the
samples
placed
on
view
a
shrewder
discrimination
than
was
exhibited
by
his
son
and
successor
liholiho
i
think
liholiho
could
have
qualified
as
a
reformer
perhaps
but
as
a
king
he
was
a
mistake
a
mistake
because
he
tried
to
be
both
king
and
reformer
this
is
mixing
fire
and
gunpowder
together
a
king
has
no
proper
business
with
reforming
his
best
policy
is
to
keep
things
as
they
are
and
if
he
can't
do
that
he
ought
to
try
to
make
them
worse
than
they
are
this
is
not
guesswork
i
have
thought
over
this
matter
a
good
deal
so
that
if
i
should
ever
have
a
chance
to
become
a
king
i
would
know
how
to
conduct
the
business
in
the
best
way
when
liholiho
succeeded
his
father
he
found
himself
possessed
of
an
equipment
of
royal
tools
and
safeguards
which
a
wiser
king
would
have
known
how
to
husband
and
judiciously
employ
and
make
profitable
the
entire
country
was
under
the
one
scepter
and
his
was
that
scepter
there
was
an
established
church
and
he
was
the
head
of
it
there
was
a
standing
army
and
he
was
the
head
of
that
an
army
of
114
privates
under
command
of
27
generals
and
a
field
marshal
there
was
a
proud
and
ancient
hereditary
nobility
there
was
still
one
other
asset
this
was
the
tabu
an
agent
endowed
with
a
mysterious
and
stupendous
power
an
agent
not
found
among
the
properties
of
any
european
monarch
a
tool
of
inestimable
value
in
the
business
liholiho
was
headmaster
of
the
tabu
the
tabu
was
the
most
ingenious
and
effective
of
all
the
inventions
that
has
ever
been
devised
for
keeping
a
people's
privileges
satisfactorily
restricted
it
required
the
sexes
to
live
in
separate
houses
it
did
not
allow
people
to
eat
in
either
house
they
must
eat
in
another
place
it
did
not
allow
a
man's
woman
folk
to
enter
his
house
it
did
not
allow
the
sexes
to
eat
together
the
men
must
eat
first
and
the
women
must
wait
on
them
then
the
women
could
eat
what
was
left
if
anything
was
left
and
wait
on
themselves
i
mean
if
anything
of
a
coarse
or
unpalatable
sort
was
left
the
women
could
have
it
but
not
the
good
things
the
fine
things
the
choice
things
such
as
pork
poultry
bananas
cocoanuts
the
choicer
varieties
of
fish
and
so
on
by
the
tabu
all
these
were
sacred
to
the
men
the
women
spent
their
lives
longing
for
them
and
wondering
what
they
might
taste
like
and
they
died
without
finding
out
these
rules
as
you
see
were
quite
simple
and
clear
it
was
easy
to
remember
them
and
useful
for
the
penalty
for
infringing
any
rule
in
the
whole
list
was
death
those
women
easily
learned
to
put
up
with
shark
and
taro
and
dog
for
a
diet
when
the
other
things
were
so
expensive
it
was
death
for
any
one
to
walk
upon
tabu'd
ground
or
defile
a
tabu'd
thing
with
his
touch
or
fail
in
due
servility
to
a
chief
or
step
upon
the
king's
shadow
the
nobles
and
the
king
and
the
priests
were
always
suspending
little
rags
here
and
there
and
yonder
to
give
notice
to
the
people
that
the
decorated
spot
or
thing
was
tabu
and
death
lurking
near
the
struggle
for
life
was
difficult
and
chancy
in
the
islands
in
those
days
thus
advantageously
was
the
new
king
situated
will
it
be
believed
that
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
destroy
his
established
church
root
and
branch
he
did
indeed
do
that
to
state
the
case
figuratively
he
was
a
prosperous
sailor
who
burnt
his
ship
and
took
to
a
raft
this
church
was
a
horrid
thing
it
heavily
oppressed
the
people
it
kept
them
always
trembling
in
the
gloom
of
mysterious
threatenings
it
slaughtered
them
in
sacrifice
before
its
grotesque
idols
of
wood
and
stone
it
cowed
them
it
terrorized
them
it
made
them
slaves
to
its
priests
and
through
the
priests
to
the
king
it
was
the
best
friend
a
king
could
have
and
the
most
dependable
to
a
professional
reformer
who
should
annihilate
so
frightful
and
so
devastating
a
power
as
this
church
reverence
and
praise
would
be
due
but
to
a
king
who
should
do
it
could
properly
be
due
nothing
but
reproach
reproach
softened
by
sorrow
sorrow
for
his
unfitness
for
his
position
he
destroyed
his
established
church
and
his
kingdom
is
a
republic
today
in
consequence
of
that
act
when
he
destroyed
the
church
and
burned
the
idols
he
did
a
mighty
thing
for
civilization
and
for
his
people's
weal
but
it
was
not
business
it
was
unkingly
it
was
inartistic
it
made
trouble
for
his
line
the
american
missionaries
arrived
while
the
burned
idols
were
still
smoking
they
found
the
nation
without
a
religion
and
they
repaired
the
defect
they
offered
their
own
religion
and
it
was
gladly
received
but
it
was
no
support
to
arbitrary
kingship
and
so
the
kingly
power
began
to
weaken
from
that
day
forty
seven
years
later
when
i
was
in
the
islands
kainehameha
v
was
trying
to
repair
liholiho's
blunder
and
not
succeeding
he
had
set
up
an
established
church
and
made
himself
the
head
of
it
but
it
was
only
a
pinchbeck
thing
an
imitation
a
bauble
an
empty
show
it
had
no
power
no
value
for
a
king
it
could
not
harry
or
burn
or
slay
it
in
no
way
resembled
the
admirable
machine
which
liholiho
destroyed
it
was
an
established
church
without
an
establishment
all
the
people
were
dissenters
long
before
that
the
kingship
had
itself
become
but
a
name
a
show
at
an
early
day
the
missionaries
had
turned
it
into
something
very
much
like
a
republic
and
here
lately
the
business
whites
have
turned
it
into
something
exactly
like
it
in
captain
cook's
time
1778
the
native
population
of
the
islands
was
estimated
at
400
000
in
1836
at
something
short
of
200
000
in
1866
at
50
000
it
is
to
day
per
census
25
000
all
intelligent
people
praise
kamehameha
i
and
liholiho
for
conferring
upon
their
people
the
great
boon
of
civilization
i
would
do
it
myself
but
my
intelligence
is
out
of
repair
now
from
over
work
when
i
was
in
the
islands
nearly
a
generation
ago
i
was
acquainted
with
a
young
american
couple
who
had
among
their
belongings
an
attractive
little
son
of
the
age
of
seven
attractive
but
not
practicably
companionable
with
me
because
he
knew
no
english
he
had
played
from
his
birth
with
the
little
kanakas
on
his
father's
plantation
and
had
preferred
their
language
and
would
learn
no
other
the
family
removed
to
america
a
month
after
i
arrived
in
the
islands
and
straightway
the
boy
began
to
lose
his
kanaka
and
pick
up
english
by
the
time
he
was
twelve
be
hadn't
a
word
of
kanaka
left
the
language
had
wholly
departed
from
his
tongue
and
from
his
comprehension
nine
years
later
when
he
was
twenty
one
i
came
upon
the
family
in
one
of
the
lake
towns
of
new
york
and
the
mother
told
me
about
an
adventure
which
her
son
had
been
having
by
trade
he
was
now
a
professional
diver
a
passenger
boat
had
been
caught
in
a
storm
on
the
lake
and
had
gone
down
carrying
her
people
with
her
a
few
days
later
the
young
diver
descended
with
his
armor
on
and
entered
the
berth
saloon
of
the
boat
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
companionway
with
his
hand
on
the
rail
peering
through
the
dim
water
presently
something
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
he
turned
and
found
a
dead
man
swaying
and
bobbing
about
him
and
seemingly
inspecting
him
inquiringly
he
was
paralyzed
with
fright
his
entry
had
disturbed
the
water
and
now
he
discerned
a
number
of
dim
corpses
making
for
him
and
wagging
their
heads
and
swaying
their
bodies
like
sleepy
people
trying
to
dance
his
senses
forsook
him
and
in
that
condition
he
was
drawn
to
the
surface
he
was
put
to
bed
at
home
and
was
soon
very
ill
during
some
days
he
had
seasons
of
delirium
which
lasted
several
hours
at
a
time
and
while
they
lasted
he
talked
kanaka
incessantly
and
glibly
and
kanaka
only
he
was
still
very
ill
and
he
talked
to
me
in
that
tongue
but
i
did
not
understand
it
of
course
the
doctor
books
tell
us
that
cases
like
this
are
not
uncommon
then
the
doctors
ought
to
study
the
cases
and
find
out
how
to
multiply
them
many
languages
and
things
get
mislaid
in
a
person's
head
and
stay
mislaid
for
lack
of
this
remedy
many
memories
of
my
former
visit
to
the
islands
came
up
in
my
mind
while
we
lay
at
anchor
in
front
of
honolulu
that
night
and
pictures
pictures
pictures
an
enchanting
procession
of
them!
i
was
impatient
for
the
morning
to
come
when
it
came
it
brought
disappointment
of
course
cholera
had
broken
out
in
the
town
and
we
were
not
allowed
to
have
any
communication
with
the
shore
thus
suddenly
did
my
dream
of
twenty
nine
years
go
to
ruin
messages
came
from
friends
but
the
friends
themselves
i
was
not
to
have
any
sight
of
my
lecture
hall
was
ready
but
i
was
not
to
see
that
either
several
of
our
passengers
belonged
in
honolulu
and
these
were
sent
ashore
but
nobody
could
go
ashore
and
return
there
were
people
on
shore
who
were
booked
to
go
with
us
to
australia
but
we
could
not
receive
them
to
do
it
would
cost
us
a
quarantine
term
in
sydney
they
could
have
escaped
the
day
before
by
ship
to
san
francisco
but
the
bars
had
been
put
up
now
and
they
might
have
to
wait
weeks
before
any
ship
could
venture
to
give
them
a
passage
any
whither
and
there
were
hardships
for
others
an
elderly
lady
and
her
son
recreation
seekers
from
massachusetts
had
wandered
westward
further
and
further
from
home
always
intending
to
take
the
return
track
but
always
concluding
to
go
still
a
little
further
and
now
here
they
were
at
anchor
before
honolulu
positively
their
last
westward
bound
indulgence
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
that
but
where
is
the
use
in
making
up
your
mind
in
this
world
it
is
usually
a
waste
of
time
to
do
it
these
two
would
have
to
stay
with
us
as
far
as
australia
then
they
could
go
on
around
the
world
or
go
back
the
way
they
had
come
the
distance
and
the
accommodations
and
outlay
of
time
would
be
just
the
same
whichever
of
the
two
routes
they
might
elect
to
take
think
of
it
a
projected
excursion
of
five
hundred
miles
gradually
enlarged
without
any
elaborate
degree
of
intention
to
a
possible
twenty
four
thousand
however
they
were
used
to
extensions
by
this
time
and
did
not
mind
this
new
one
much
and
we
had
with
us
a
lawyer
from
victoria
who
had
been
sent
out
by
the
government
on
an
international
matter
and
he
had
brought
his
wife
with
him
and
left
the
children
at
home
with
the
servants
and
now
what
was
to
be
done
go
ashore
amongst
the
cholera
and
take
the
risks
most
certainly
not
they
decided
to
go
on
to
the
fiji
islands
wait
there
a
fortnight
for
the
next
ship
and
then
sail
for
home
they
couldn't
foresee
that
they
wouldn't
see
a
homeward
bound
ship
again
for
six
weeks
and
that
no
word
could
come
to
them
from
the
children
and
no
word
go
from
them
to
the
children
in
all
that
time
it
is
easy
to
make
plans
in
this
world
even
a
cat
can
do
it
and
when
one
is
out
in
those
remote
oceans
it
is
noticeable
that
a
cat's
plans
and
a
man's
are
worth
about
the
same
there
is
much
the
same
shrinkage
in
both
in
the
matter
of
values
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
sit
about
the
decks
in
the
shade
of
the
awnings
and
look
at
the
distant
shore
we
lay
in
luminous
blue
water
shoreward
the
water
was
green
green
and
brilliant
at
the
shore
itself
it
broke
in
a
long
white
ruffle
and
with
no
crash
no
sound
that
we
could
hear
the
town
was
buried
under
a
mat
of
foliage
that
looked
like
a
cushion
of
moss
the
silky
mountains
were
clothed
in
soft
rich
splendors
of
melting
color
and
some
of
the
cliffs
were
veiled
in
slanting
mists
i
recognized
it
all
it
was
just
as
i
had
seen
it
long
before
with
nothing
of
its
beauty
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
wanting
a
change
had
come
but
that
was
political
and
not
visible
from
the
ship
the
monarchy
of
my
day
was
gone
and
a
republic
was
sitting
in
its
seat
it
was
not
a
material
change
the
old
imitation
pomps
the
fuss
and
feathers
have
departed
and
the
royal
trademark
that
is
about
all
that
one
could
miss
i
suppose
that
imitation
monarchy
was
grotesque
enough
in
my
time
if
it
had
held
on
another
thirty
years
it
would
have
been
a
monarchy
without
subjects
of
the
king's
race
we
had
a
sunset
of
a
very
fine
sort
the
vast
plain
of
the
sea
was
marked
off
in
bands
of
sharply
contrasted
colors
great
stretches
of
dark
blue
others
of
purple
others
of
polished
bronze
the
billowy
mountains
showed
all
sorts
of
dainty
browns
and
greens
blues
and
purples
and
blacks
and
the
rounded
velvety
backs
of
certain
of
them
made
one
want
to
stroke
them
as
one
would
the
sleek
back
of
a
cat
the
long
sloping
promontory
projecting
into
the
sea
at
the
west
turned
dim
and
leaden
and
spectral
then
became
suffused
with
pink
dissolved
itself
in
a
pink
dream
so
to
speak
it
seemed
so
airy
and
unreal
presently
the
cloud
rack
was
flooded
with
fiery
splendors
and
these
were
copied
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
it
made
one
drunk
with
delight
to
look
upon
it
from
talks
with
certain
of
our
passengers
whose
home
was
honolulu
and
from
a
sketch
by
mrs
mary
h
krout
i
was
able
to
perceive
what
the
honolulu
of
to
day
is
as
compared
with
the
honolulu
of
my
time
in
my
time
it
was
a
beautiful
little
town
made
up
of
snow
white
wooden
cottages
deliciously
smothered
in
tropical
vines
and
flowers
and
trees
and
shrubs
and
its
coral
roads
and
streets
were
hard
and
smooth
and
as
white
as
the
houses
the
outside
aspects
of
the
place
suggested
the
presence
of
a
modest
and
comfortable
prosperity
a
general
prosperity
perhaps
one
might
strengthen
the
term
and
say
universal
there
were
no
fine
houses
no
fine
furniture
there
were
no
decorations
tallow
candles
furnished
the
light
for
the
bedrooms
a
whale
oil
lamp
furnished
it
for
the

native
matting
served
as

in

would

was
nothing
reminiscent
of
foreign
parts
for
nobody
had
been
abroad
trips
were
made
to
san
francisco
but
that
could
not
be
called
going
abroad
comprehensively
speaking
nobody
traveled
but
honolulu
has
grown
wealthy
since
then
and
of
course
wealth
has
introduced
changes
some
of
the
old
simplicities
have
disappeared
here
is
a
modern
house
as
pictured
by
mrs
krout
almost
every
house
is
surrounded
by
extensive
lawns
and
gardens
enclosed
by
walls
of
volcanic
stone
or
by
thick
hedges
of
the
brilliant
hibiscus
the
houses
are
most
tastefully
and
comfortably
furnished
the
floors
are
either
of
hard
wood
covered
with
rugs
or
with
fine
indian
matting
while
there
is
a
preference
as
in
most
warm
countries
for
rattan
or
bamboo
furniture
there
are
the
usual
accessories
of
bric
a
brac
pictures
books
and
curios
from
all
parts
of
the
world
for
these
island
dwellers
are
indefatigable
travelers
nearly
every
house
has
what
is
called
a
lanai
it
is
a
large
apartment
roofed
floored
open
on
three
sides
with
a
door
or
a
draped
archway
opening
into
the
drawing
room
frequently
the
roof
is
formed
by
the
thick
interlacing
boughs
of
the
hou
tree
impervious
to
the
sun
and
even
to
the
rain
except
in
violent
storms
vines
are
trained
about
the
sides
the
stephanotis
or
some
one
of
the
countless
fragrant
and
blossoming
trailers
which
abound
in
the
islands
there
are
also
curtains
of
matting
that
may
be
drawn
to
exclude
the
sun
or
rain
the
floor
is
bare
for
coolness
or
partially
covered
with
rugs
and
the
lanai
is
prettily
furnished
with
comfortable
chairs
sofas
and
tables
loaded
with
flowers
or
wonderful
ferns
in
pots
the
lanai
is
the
favorite
reception
room
and
here
at
any
social
function
the
musical
program
is
given
and
cakes
and
ices
are
served
here
morning
callers
are
received
or
gay
riding
parties
the
ladies
in
pretty
divided
skirts
worn
for
convenience
in
riding
astride
the
universal
mode
adopted
by
europeans
and
americans
as
well
as
by
the
natives
the
comfort
and
luxury
of
such
an
apartment
especially
at
a
seashore
villa
can
hardly
be
imagined
the
soft
breezes
sweep
across
it
heavy
with
the
fragrance
of
jasmine
and
gardenia
and
through
the
swaying
boughs
of
palm
and
mimosa
there
are
glimpses
of
rugged
mountains
their
summits
veiled
in
clouds
of
purple
sea
with
the
white
surf
beating
eternally
against
the
reefs
whiter
still
in
the
yellow
sunlight
or
the
magical

of
the
tropics

rugs

fetched
from
everywhere
and
the
ladies
riding
astride
these
are
changes
indeed
in
my
time
the
native
women
rode
astride
but
the
white
ones
lacked
the
courage
to
adopt
their
wise
custom
in
my
time
ice
was
seldom
seen
in
honolulu
it
sometimes
came
in
sailing
vessels
from
new
england
as
ballast
and
then
if
there
happened
to
be
a
man
of
war
in
port
and
balls
and
suppers
raging
by
consequence
the
ballast
was
worth
six
hundred
dollars
a
ton
as
is
evidenced
by
reputable
tradition
but
the
ice
machine
has
traveled
all
over
the
world
now
and
brought
ice
within
everybody's
reach
in
lapland
and
spitzbergen
no
one
uses
native
ice
in
our
day
except
the
bears
and
the
walruses
the
bicycle
is
not
mentioned
it
was
not
necessary
we
know
that
it
is
there
without
inquiring
it
is
everywhere
but
for
it
people
could
never
have
had
summer
homes
on
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
before
its
day
property
up
there
had
but
a
nominal
value
the
ladies
of
the
hawaiian
capital
learned
too
late
the
right
way
to
occupy
a
horse
too
late
to
get
much
benefit
from
it
the
riding
horse
is
retiring
from
business
everywhere
in
the
world
in
honolulu
a
few
years
from
now
he
will
be
only
a
tradition
we
all
know
about
father
damien
the
french
priest
who
voluntarily
forsook
the
world
and
went
to
the
leper
island
of
molokai
to
labor
among
its
population
of
sorrowful
exiles
who
wait
there
in
slow
consuming
misery
for
death
to
cone
and
release
them
from
their
troubles
and
we
know
that
the
thing
which
he
knew
beforehand
would
happen
did
happen
that
he
became
a
leper
himself
and
died
of
that
horrible
disease
there
was
still
another
case
of
self
sacrifice
it
appears
i
asked
after
billy
ragsdale
interpreter
to
the
parliament
in
my
time
a
half
white
he
was
a
brilliant
young
fellow
and
very
popular
as
an
interpreter
he
would
have
been
hard
to
match
anywhere
he
used
to
stand
up
in
the
parliament
and
turn
the
english
speeches
into
hawaiian
and
the
hawaiian
speeches
into
english
with
a
readiness
and
a
volubility
that
were
astonishing
i
asked
after
him
and
was
told
that
his
prosperous
career
was
cut
short
in
a
sudden
and
unexpected
way
just
as
he
was
about
to
marry
a
beautiful
half
caste
girl
he
discovered
by
some
nearly
invisible
sign
about
his
skin
that
the
poison
of
leprosy
was
in
him
the
secret
was
his
own
and
might
be
kept
concealed
for
years
but
he
would
not
be
treacherous
to
the
girl
that
loved
him
he
would
not
marry
her
to
a
doom
like
his
and
so
he
put
his
affairs
in
order
and
went
around
to
all
his
friends
and
bade
them
good
bye
and
sailed
in
the
leper
ship
to
molokai
there
he
died
the
loathsome
and
lingering
death
that
all
lepers
die
in
this
place
let
me
insert
a
paragraph
or
two
from
the
paradise
of
the
pacific
rev
h
h
gowen
poor
lepers!
it
is
easy
for
those
who
have
no
relatives
or
friends
among
them
to
enforce
the
decree
of
segregation
to
the
letter
but
who
can
write
of
the
terrible
the
heart
breaking
scenes
which
that
enforcement
has
brought
about
a
man
upon
hawaii
was
suddenly
taken
away
after
a
summary
arrest
leaving
behind
him
a
helpless
wife
about
to
give
birth
to
a
babe
the
devoted
wife
with
great
pain
and
risk
came
the
whole
journey
to
honolulu
and
pleaded
until
the
authorities
were
unable
to
resist
her
entreaty
that
she
might
go
and
live
like
a
leper
with
her
leper
husband
a
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
and
activity
is
condemned
as
an
incipient
leper
suddenly
removed
from
her
home
and
her
husband
returns
to
find
his
two
helpless
babes
moaning
for
their
lost
mother
imagine
it!
the
case
of
the
babies
is
hard
but
its
bitterness
is
a
trifle
less
than
a
trifle
less
than
nothing
compared
to
what
the
mother
must
suffer
and
suffer
minute
by
minute
hour
by
hour
day

day

month

without
respite

or
any
abatement

pain

has
been
living
with
her
leper
husband
in

settlement
for
twelve
years
the
man
has
scarcely
a
joint
left
his
limbs
are
only
distorted
ulcerated
stumps
for
four
years
his
wife
has
put
every
particle
of
food
into
his
mouth
he
wanted
his
wife
to
abandon
his
wretched
carcass
long
ago
as
she
herself
was
sound
and
well
but
luka
said
that
she
was
content
to
remain
and
wait
on
the
man
she
loved
till
the
spirit
should
be
freed
from
its
burden
i
myself
have
known
hard
cases
enough
of
a
girl
apparently
in
full
health
decorating
the
church
with
me
at
easter
who
before
christmas
is
taken
away
as
a
confirmed
leper
of
a
mother
hiding
her
child
in
the
mountains
for
years
so
that
not
even
her
dearest
friends
knew
that
she
had
a
child
alive
that
he
might
not
be
taken
away
of
a
respectable
white
man
taken
away
from
his
wife
and
family
and
compelled
to
become
a
dweller
in
the
leper
settlement
where
he
is
counted
dead
even
by
the
insurance
companies
and
one
great
pity
of
it
all
is
that
these
poor
sufferers
are
innocent
the
leprosy
does
not
come
of
sins
which
they
committed
but
of
sins
committed
by
their
ancestors
who
escaped
the
curse
of
leprosy!
mr
gowan
has
made
record
of
a
certain
very
striking
circumstance
would
you
expect
to
find
in
that
awful
leper
settlement
a
custom
worthy
to
be
transplanted
to
your
own
country
they
have
one
such
and
it
is
inexpressibly
touching
and
beautiful
when
death
sets
open
the
prison
door
of
life
there
the
band
salutes
the
freed
soul
with
a
burst
of
glad
music!

closing

this

a

explained
to

that
the

is
poor
because
we
are
climbing
up
the

toward
the

that
when
we
should

we
should

asked

said

lather
up

shave
everybody
who
was
crossing

the
first
time
and
then
cleanse
these
unfortunates
by
swinging
them
from
the
yard
arm
and
ducking
them
three
times
in
the
sea
this
was
considered
funny
nobody
knows
why
no
that
is
not
true
we
do
know
why
such
a
thing
could
never
be
funny
on
land
no
part
of
the
old
time
grotesque
performances
gotten
up
on
shipboard
to
celebrate
the
passage
of
the
line
would
ever
be
funny
on
shore
they
would
seem
dreary
and
less
to
shore
people
but
the
shore
people
would
change
their
minds
about
it
at
sea
on
a
long
voyage
on
such
a
voyage
with
its
eternal
monotonies
people's
intellects
deteriorate
the
owners
of
the
intellects
soon
reach
a
point
where
they
almost
seem
to
prefer
childish
things
to
things
of
a
maturer
degree
one
is
often
surprised
at
the
juvenilities
which
grown
people
indulge
in
at
sea
and
the
interest
they
take
in
them
and
the
consuming
enjoyment
they
get
out
of
them
this
is
on
long
voyages
only
the
mind
gradually
becomes
inert
dull
blunted
it
loses
its
accustomed
interest
in
intellectual
things
nothing
but
horse
play
can
rouse
it
nothing
but
wild
and
foolish
grotesqueries
can
entertain
it
on
short
voyages
it
makes
no
such
exposure
of
itself
it
hasn't
time
to
slump
down
to
this
sorrowful
level
the
short
voyage
passenger
gets
his
chief
physical
exercise
out
of
horse
billiards
shovel
board
it
is
a
good
game
we
play
it
in
this
ship
a
quartermaster
chalks
off
a
diagram
like
this
on
the
deck
the
player
uses
a
cue
that
is
like
a
broom
handle
with
a
quarter
moon
of
wood
fastened
to
the
end
of
it
with
this
he
shoves
wooden
disks
the
size
of
a
saucer
he
gives
the
disk
a
vigorous
shove
and
sends
it
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
along
the
deck
and
lands
it
in
one
of
the
squares
if
he
can
if
it
stays
there
till
the
inning
is
played
out
it
will
count
as
many
points
in
the
game
as
the
figure
in
the
square
it
has
stopped
in
represents
the
adversary
plays
to
knock
that
disk
out
and
leave
his
own
in
its
place
particularly
if
it
rests
upon
the
9
or
10
or
some
other
of
the
high
numbers
but
if
it
rests
in
the
10off
he
backs
it
up
lands
his
disk
behind
it
a
foot
or
two
to
make
it
difficult
for
its
owner
to
knock
it
out
of
that
damaging
place
and
improve
his
record
when
the
inning
is
played
out
it
may
be
found
that
each
adversary
has
placed
his
four
disks
where
they
count
it
may
be
found
that
some
of
them
are
touching
chalk
lines
and
not
counting
and
very
often
it
will
be
found
that
there
has
been
a
general
wreckage
and
that
not
a
disk
has
been
left
within
the
diagram
anyway
the
result
is
recorded
whatever
it
is
and
the
game
goes
on
the
game
is
100
points
and
it
takes
from
twenty
minutes
to
forty
to
play
it
according
to
luck
and
the
condition
of
the
sea
it
is
an
exciting
game
and
the
crowd
of
spectators
furnish
abundance
of
applause
for
fortunate
shots
and
plenty
of
laughter
for
the
other
kind
it
is
a
game
of
skill
but
at
the
same
time
the
uneasy
motion
of
the
ship
is
constantly
interfering
with
skill
this
makes
it
a
chancy
game
and
the
element
of
luck
comes
largely
in
we
had
a
couple
of
grand
tournaments
to
determine
who
should
be
champion
of
the
pacific
they
included
among
the
participants
nearly
all
the
passengers
of
both
sexes
and
the
officers
of
the
ship
and
they
afforded
many
days
of
stupendous
interest
and
excitement
and
murderous
exercise
for
horse
billiards
is
a
physically
violent
game
the
figures
in
the
following
record
of
some
of
the
closing
games
in
the
first
tournament
will
show
better
than
any
description
how
very
chancy
the
game
is
the
losers
here
represented
had
all
been
winners
in
the
previous
games
of
the

mr

and
i
were
the
contestants
he
won
the
lead
and
went
to
the
bat
so
to
speak
and
there
he
stood
with
the
crotch
of
his
cue
resting
against
his
disk
while
the
ship
rose
slowly

sank
slowly

rose

sank

she
never
seemed
to

to

him
exactly
she
started
up
once
more
and
when
she
was
nearly
ready
for
the
turn
he
let
drive
and
landed
his
disk
just
within
the
left
hand
end
of
the
10
applause
the
umpire
proclaimed
a
good
10
and
the
game
keeper
set
it
down
i
played
my
disk
grazed
the
edge
of
mr
thomas's
disk
and
went
out
of
the
diagram
no
applause
mr
thomas
played
again
and
landed
his
second
disk
alongside
of
the
first
and
almost
touching
its
right
hand
side
good
10
great
applause
i
played
and
missed
both
of
them
no
applause
mr
thomas
delivered
his
third
shot
and
landed
his
disk
just
at
the
right
of
the
other
two
good
10
immense
applause
there
they
lay
side
by
side
the
three
in
a
row
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
anybody
could
miss
them
still
i
did
it
immense
silence
mr
thomas
played
his
last
disk
it
seems
incredible
but
he
actually
landed
that
disk
alongside
of
the
others
and
just
to
the
right
of
them
a
straight
solid
row
of
4
disks
tumultuous
and
long
continued
applause
then
i
played
my
last
disk
again
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
anybody
could
miss
that
row
a
row
which
would
have
been
14
inches
long
if
the
disks
had
been
clamped
together
whereas
with
the
spaces
separating
them
they
made
a
longer
row
than
that
but
i
did
it
it
may
be
that
i
was
getting
nervous
i
think
it
unlikely
that
that
innings
has
ever
had
its
parallel
in
the
history
of
horse
billiards
to
place
the
four
disks
side
by
side
in
the
10
was
an
extraordinary
feat
indeed
it
was
a
kind
of
miracle
to
miss
them
was
another
miracle
it
will
take
a
century
to
produce
another
man
who
can
place
the
four
disks
in
the
10
and
longer
than
that
to
find
a
man
who
can't
knock
them
out
i
was
ashamed
of
my
performance
at
the
time
but
now
that
i
reflect
upon
it
i
see
that
it
was
rather
fine
and
difficult
mr
thomas
kept
his
luck
and
won
the
game
and
later
the
championship
in
a
minor
tournament
i
won
the
prize
which
was
a
waterbury
watch
i
put
it
in
my
trunk
in
pretoria
south
africa
nine
months
afterward
my
proper
watch
broke
down
and
i
took
the
waterbury
out
wound
it
set
it
by
the
great
clock
on
the
parliament
house
8
05
then
went
back
to
my
room
and
went
to
bed
tired
from
a
long
railway
journey
the
parliamentary
clock
had
a
peculiarity
which
i
was
not
aware
of
at
the
time
a
peculiarity
which
exists
in
no
other
clock
and
would
not
exist
in
that
one
if
it
had
been
made
by
a
sane
person
on
the
half
hour
it
strikes
the
succeeding
hour
then
strikes
the
hour
again
at
the
proper
time
i
lay
reading
and
smoking
awhile
then
when
i
could
hold
my
eyes
open
no
longer
and
was
about
to
put
out
the
light
the
great
clock
began
to
boom
and
i
counted
ten
i
reached
for
the
waterbury
to
see
how
it
was
getting
along
it
was
marking
9
30
it
seemed
rather
poor
speed
for
a
three
dollar
watch
but
i
supposed
that
the
climate
was
affecting
it
i
shoved
it
half
an
hour
ahead
and
took
to
my
book
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
at
10
the
great
clock
struck
ten
again
i
looked
the
waterbury
was
marking
half
past
10
this
was
too
much
speed
for
the
money
and
it
troubled
me
i
pushed
the
hands
back
a
half
hour
and
waited
once
more
i
had
to
for
i
was
vexed
and
restless
now
and
my
sleepiness
was
gone
by
and
by
the
great
clock
struck
11
the
waterbury
was
marking
10
30
i
pushed
it
ahead
half
an
hour
with
some
show
of
temper
by
and
by
the
great
clock
struck
11
again
the
waterbury
showed
up
11
30
now
and
i
beat
her
brains
out
against
the
bedstead
i
was
sorry
next
day
when
i
found
out
to
return
to
the
ship
the
average
human
being
is
a
perverse
creature
and
when
he
isn't
that
he
is
a
practical
joker
the
result
to
the
other
person
concerned
is
about
the
same
that
is
he
is
made
to
suffer
the
washing
down
of
the
decks
begins
at
a
very
early
hour
in
all
ships
in
but
few
ships
are
any
measures
taken
to
protect
the
passengers
either
by
waking
or
warning
them
or
by
sending
a
steward
to
close
their
ports
and
so
the
deckwashers
have
their
opportunity
and
they
use
it
they
send
a
bucket
of
water
slashing
along
the
side
of
the
ship
and
into
the
ports
drenching
the
passenger's
clothes
and
often
the
passenger
himself
this
good
old
custom
prevailed
in
this
ship
and
under
unusually
favorable
circumstances
for
in
the
blazing
tropical
regions
a
removable
zinc
thing
like
a
sugarshovel
projects
from
the
port
to
catch
the
wind
and
bring
it
in
this
thing
catches
the
wash
water
and
brings
it
in
too
and
in
flooding
abundance
mrs
l
an
invalid
had
to
sleep
on
the
locker
sofa
under
her
port
and
every
time
she
over
slept
and
thus
failed
to
take
care
of
herself
the
deck
washers
drowned
her
out
and
the
painters
what
a
good
time
they
had!
this
ship
would
be
going
into
dock
for
a
month
in
sydney
for
repairs
but
no
matter
painting
was
going
on
all
the
time
somewhere
or
other
the
ladies'
dresses
were
constantly
getting
ruined
nevertheless
protests
and
supplications
went
for
nothing
sometimes
a
lady
taking
an
afternoon
nap
on
deck
near
a
ventilator
or
some
other
thing
that
didn't
need
painting
would
wake
up
by
and
by
and
find
that
the
humorous
painter
had
been
noiselessly
daubing
that
thing
and
had
splattered
her
white
gown
all
over
with
little
greasy
yellow
spots
the
blame
for
this
untimely
painting
did
not
lie
with
the
ship's
officers
but
with
custom
as
far
back
as
noah's
time
it
became
law
that
ships
must
be
constantly
painted
and
fussed
at
when
at
sea
custom
grew
out
of
the
law
and
at
sea
custom
knows
no
death
this
custom
will
continue
until
the
sea
goes

sunday
we
are
moving
so
nearly
south
that
we
cross
only
about
two
meridians
of
longitude
a

this
morning
we
were
in
longitude
178
west
from
greenwich
and
57
degrees

from

to

we
shall
be
close

the

the
180th
degree
of
west
longitude
and
180th
degree
of

and
then
we
must
drop
out
a
day
lose
a
day
out
of
our
lives
a
day
never
to
be
found
again
we
shall
all
die
one
day
earlier
than
from
the
beginning
of
time
we
were
foreordained
to
die
we
shall
be
a
day
behindhand
all
through
eternity
we
shall
always
be
saying
to
the
other
angels
fine
day
today
and
they
will
be
always
retorting
but
it
isn't
to
day
it's
tomorrow
we
shall
be
in
a
state
of
confusion
all
the
time
and
shall
never
know
what
true
happiness
is
next
day
sure
enough
it
has
happened
yesterday
it
was
september
8
sunday
to
day
per
the
bulletin
board
at
the
head
of
the
companionway
it
is
september
10
tuesday
there
is
something
uncanny
about
it
and
uncomfortable
in
fact
nearly
unthinkable
and
wholly
unrealizable
when
one
comes
to
consider
it
while
we
were
crossing
the
180th
meridian
it
was
sunday
in
the
stern
of
the
ship
where
my
family
were
and
tuesday
in
the
bow
where
i
was
they
were
there
eating
the
half
of
a
fresh
apple
on
the
8th
and
i
was
at
the
same
time
eating
the
other
half
of
it
on
the
10th
and
i
could
notice
how
stale
it
was
already
the
family
were
the
same
age
that
they
were
when
i
had
left
them
five
minutes
before
but
i
was
a
day
older
now
than
i
was
then
the
day
they
were
living
in
stretched
behind
them
half
way
round
the
globe
across
the
pacific
ocean
and
america
and
europe
the
day
i
was
living
in
stretched
in
front
of
me
around
the
other
half
to
meet
it
they
were
stupendous
days
for
bulk
and
stretch
apparently
much
larger
days
than
we
had
ever
been
in
before
all
previous
days
had
been
but
shrunk
up
little
things
by
comparison
the
difference
in
temperature
between
the
two
days
was
very
marked
their
day
being
hotter
than
mine
because
it
was
closer
to
the
equator
along
about
the
moment
that
we
were
crossing
the
great
meridian
a
child
was
born
in
the
steerage
and
now
there
is
no
way
to
tell
which
day
it
was
born
on
the
nurse
thinks
it
was
sunday
the
surgeon
thinks
it
was
tuesday
the
child
will
never
know
its
own
birthday
it
will
always
be
choosing
first
one
and
then
the
other
and
will
never
be
able
to
make
up
its
mind
permanently
this
will
breed
vacillation
and
uncertainty
in
its
opinions
about
religion
and
politics
and
business
and
sweethearts
and
everything
and
will
undermine
its
principles
and
rot
them
away
and
make
the
poor
thing
characterless
and
its
success
in
life
impossible
every
one
in
the
ship
says
so
and
this
is
not
all
in
fact
not
the
worst
for
there
is
an
enormously
rich
brewer
in
the
ship
who
said
as
much
as
ten
days
ago
that
if
the
child
was
born
on
his
birthday
he
would
give
it
ten
thousand
dollars
to
start
its
little
life
with
his
birthday
was
monday
the
9th
of
september
if
the
ships
all
moved
in
the
one
direction
westward
i
mean
the
world
would
suffer
a
prodigious
loss
in
the
matter
of
valuable
time
through
the
dumping
overboard
on
the
great
meridian
of
such
multitudes
of
days
by
ships
crews
and
passengers
but
fortunately
the
ships
do
not
all
sail
west
half
of
them
sail
east
so
there
is
no
real
loss
these
latter
pick
up
all
the
discarded
days
and
add
them
to
the
world's
stock
again
and
about
as
good
as
new
too
for
of
course
the

preserves

in
this
world
we
often
make
mistakes
of
judgment
we
do
not
as
a
rule
get
out
of
them
sound
and
whole
but
sometimes
we
do
at
dinner
yesterday
evening
present
a
mixture
of
scotch
english
american
canadian
and
australasian
folk
a
discussion
broke
out
about
the
pronunciation
of
certain
scottish
words
this
was
private
ground
and
the
non
scotch
nationalities
with
one
exception
discreetly
kept
still
but
i
am
not
discreet
and
i
took
a
hand
i
didn't
know
anything
about
the
subject
but
i
took
a
hand
just
to
have
something
to
do
at
that
moment
the
word
in
dispute
was
the
word
three
one
scotchman
was
claiming
that
the
peasantry
of
scotland
pronounced
it
three
his
adversaries
claimed
that
they
didn't
that
they
pronounced
it
'thraw'
the
solitary
scot
was
having
a
sultry
time
of
it
so
i
thought
i
would
enrich
him
with
my
help
in
my
position
i
was
necessarily
quite
impartial
and
was
equally
as
well
and
as
ill
equipped
to
fight
on
the
one
side
as
on
the
other
so
i
spoke
up
and
said
the
peasantry
pronounced
the
word
three
not
thraw
it
was
an
error
of
judgment
there
was
a
moment
of
astonished
and
ominous
silence
then
weather
ensued
the
storm
rose
and
spread
in
a
surprising
way
and
i
was
snowed
under
in
a
very
few
minutes
it
was
a
bad
defeat
for
me
a
kind
of
waterloo
it
promised
to
remain
so
and
i
wished
i
had
had
better
sense
than
to
enter
upon
such
a
forlorn
enterprise
but
just
then
i
had
a
saving
thought
at
least
a
thought
that
offered
a
chance
while
the
storm
was
still
raging
i
made
up
a
scotch
couplet
and
then
spoke
up
and
said
very
well
don't
say
any
more
i
confess
defeat
i
thought
i
knew
but
i
see
my
mistake
i
was
deceived
by
one
of
your
scotch
poets
a
scotch
poet!
o
come!
name
him
robert
burns
it
is
wonderful
the
power
of
that
name
these
men
looked
doubtful
but
paralyzed
all
the
same
they
were
quite
silent
for
a
moment
then
one
of
them
said
with
the
reverence
in
his
voice
which
is
always
present
in
a
scotchman's
tone
when
he
utters
the
name
does
robbie
burns
say
what
does
he
say
this
is
what
he
says
'there
were
nae
bairns
but
only
three
ane
at
the
breast
twa
at
the
knee
'
it
ended
the
discussion
there
was
no
man
there
profane
enough
disloyal
enough
to
say
any
word
against
a
thing
which
robert
burns
had
settled
i
shall
always
honor
that
great
name
for
the
salvation
it
brought
me
in
this
time
of
my
sore
need
it
is
my
belief
that
nearly
any
invented
quotation
played
with
confidence
stands
a
good
chance
to
deceive
there
are
people
who
think
that
honesty
is
always
the
best
policy
this
is
a
superstition
there
are
times
when
the
appearance
of
it
is
worth
six
of
it
we
are
moving
steadily
southward
getting
further
and
further
down
under
the
projecting
paunch
of
the
globe
yesterday
evening
we
saw
the
big
dipper
and
the
north
star
sink
below
the
horizon
and
disappear
from
our
world
no
not
we
but
they
they
saw
it
somebody
saw
it
and
told
me
about
it
but
it
is
no
matter
i
was
not
caring
for
those
things
i
am
tired
of
them
any
way
i
think
they
are
well
enough
but
one
doesn't
want
them
always
hanging
around
my
interest
was
all
in
the
southern
cross
i
had
never
seen
that
i
had
heard
about
it
all
my
life
and
it
was
but
natural
that
i
should
be
burning
to
see
it
no
other
constellation
makes
so
much
talk
i
had
nothing
against
the
big
dipper
and
naturally
couldn't
have
anything
against
it
since
it
is
a
citizen
of
our
own
sky
and
the
property
of
the
united
states
but
i
did
want
it
to
move
out
of
the
way
and
give
this
foreigner
a
chance
judging
by
the
size
of
the
talk
which
the
southern
cross
had
made
i
supposed
it
would
need
a
sky
all
to
itself
but
that
was
a
mistake
we
saw
the
cross
to
night
and
it
is
not
large
not
large
and
not
strikingly
bright
but
it
was
low
down
toward
the
horizon
and
it
may
improve
when
it
gets
up
higher
in
the
sky
it
is
ingeniously
named
for
it
looks
just
as
a
cross
would
look
if
it
looked
like
something
else
but
that
description
does
not
describe
it
is
too
vague
too
general
too
indefinite
it
does
after
a
fashion
suggest
a
cross
across
that
is
out
of
repair
or
out
of
drawing
not
correctly
shaped
it
is
long
with
a
short
cross
bar
and
the
cross
bar
is
canted
out
of
the
straight
line
it
consists
of
four
large
stars
and
one
little
one
the
little
one
is
out
of
line
and
further
damages
the
shape
it
should
have
been
placed
at
the
intersection
of
the
stem
and
the
cross
bar
if
you
do
not
draw
an
imaginary
line
from
star
to
star
it
does
not
suggest
a
cross
nor
anything
in
particular
one
must
ignore
the
little
star
and
leave
it
out
of
the
combination
it
confuses
everything
if
you
leave
it
out
then
you
can
make
out
of
the
four
stars
a
sort
of
cross
out
of
true
or
a
sort
of
kite
out
of
true
or
a
sort
of
coffin
out
of
true
constellations
have
always
been
troublesome
things
to
name
if
you
give
one
of
them
a
fanciful
name
it
will
always
refuse
to
live
up
to
it
it
will
always
persist
in
not
resembling
the
thing
it
has
been
named
for
ultimately
to
satisfy
the
public
the
fanciful
name
has
to
be
discarded
for
a
common
sense
one
a
manifestly
descriptive
one
the
great
bear
remained
the
great
bear
and
unrecognizable
as
such
for
thousands
of
years
and
people
complained
about
it
all
the
time
and
quite
properly
but
as
soon
as
it
became
the
property
of
the
united
states
congress
changed
it
to
the
big
dipper
and
now
every
body
is
satisfied
and
there
is
no
more
talk
about
riots
i
would
not
change
the
southern
cross
to
the
southern
coffin
i
would
change
it
to
the
southern
kite
for
up
there
in
the
general
emptiness
is
the
proper
home
of
a
kite
but
not
for
coffins
and
crosses
and
dippers
in
a
little
while
now
i
cannot
tell
exactly
how
long
it
will
be
the
globe
will
belong
to
the
english
speaking
race
and
of
course
the
skies
also
then
the
constellations
will
be
re
organized
and
polished
up
and
re
named
the
most
of
them
victoria
i
reckon
but
this
one
will
sail
thereafter
as
the
southern
kite
or
go
out
of
business
several
towns
and
things
here
and
there
have
been
named
for
her
majesty
already
in
these
past
few
days
we
are
plowing
through
a
mighty
milky
way
of
islands
they
are
so
thick
on
the
map
that
one
would
hardly
expect
to
find
room
between
them
for
a
canoe
yet
we
seldom
glimpse
one
once
we
saw
the
dim
bulk
of
a
couple
of
them
far
away
spectral
and
dreamy
things
members
of
the
horne
alofa
and
fortuna
on
the
larger
one
are
two
rival
native
kings
and
they
have
a
time
together
they
are
catholics
so
are
their
people
the
missionaries
there
are
french
priests
from
the
multitudinous
islands
in
these
regions
the
recruits
for
the
queensland
plantations
were
formerly
drawn
are
still
drawn
from
them
i
believe
vessels
fitted
up
like
old
time
slavers
came
here
and
carried
off
the
natives
to
serve
as
laborers
in
the
great
australian
province
in
the
beginning
it
was
plain
simple
man
stealing
as
per
testimony
of
the
missionaries
this
has
been
denied
but
not
disproven
afterward
it
was
forbidden
by
law
to
recruit
a
native
without
his
consent
and
governmental
agents
were
sent
in
all
recruiting
vessels
to
see
that
the
law
was
obeyed
which
they
did
according
to
the
recruiting
people
and
which
they
sometimes
didn't
according
to
the
missionaries
a
man
could
be
lawfully
recruited
for
a
three
years
term
of
service
he
could
volunteer
for
another
term
if
he
so
chose
when
his
time
was
up
he
could
return
to
his
island
and
would
also
have
the
means
to
do
it
for
the
government
required
the
employer
to
put
money
in
its
hands
for
this
purpose
before
the
recruit
was
delivered
to
him
captain
wawn
was
a
recruiting
ship
master
during
many
years
from
his
pleasant
book
one
gets
the
idea
that
the
recruiting
business
was
quite
popular
with
the
islanders
as
a
rule
and
yet
that
did
not
make
the
business
wholly
dull
and
uninteresting
for
one
finds
rather
frequent
little
breaks
in
the
monotony
of
it
like
this
for
instance
the
afternoon
of
our
arrival
at
leper
island
the
schooner
was
lying
almost
becalmed
under
the
lee
of
the
lofty
central
portion
of
the
island
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
shore
the
boats
were
in
sight
at
some
distance
the
recruiter
boat
had
run
into
a
small
nook
on
the
rocky
coast
under
a
high
bank
above
which
stood
a
solitary
hut
backed
by
dense
forest
the
government
agent
and
mate
in
the
second
boat
lay
about
400
yards
to
the
westward
suddenly
we
heard
the
sound
of
firing
followed
by
yells
from
the
natives
on
shore
and
then
we
saw
the
recruiter
boat
push
out
with
a
seemingly
diminished
crew
the
mate's
boat
pulled
quickly
up
took
her
in
tow
and
presently
brought
her
alongside
all
her
own
crew
being
more
or
less
hurt
it
seems
the
natives
had
called
them
into
the
place
on
pretence
of
friendship
a
crowd
gathered
about
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
several
fellows
even
got
into
her
all
of
a
sudden
our
men
were
attacked
with
clubs
and
tomahawks
the
recruiter
escaped
the
first
blows
aimed
at
him
making
play
with
his
fists
until
he
had
an
opportunity
to
draw
his
revolver
'tom
sayers
'
a
mare
man
received
a
tomahawk
blow
on
the
head
which
laid
the
scalp
open
but
did
not
penetrate
his
skull
fortunately
'bobby
towns
'
another
mare
boatman
had
both
his
thumbs
cut
in
warding
off
blows
one
of
them
being
so
nearly
severed
from
the
hand
that
the
doctors
had
to
finish
the
operation
lihu
a
lifu
boy
the
recruiter's
special
attendant
was
cut
and
pricked
in
various
places
but
nowhere
seriously
jack
an
unlucky
tanna
recruit
who
had
been
engaged
to
act
as
boatman
received
an
arrow
through
his
forearm
the
head
of
which
apiece
of
bone
seven
or
eight
inches
long
was
still
in
the
limb
protruding
from
both
sides
when
the
boats
returned
the
recruiter
himself
would
have
got
off
scot
free
had
not
an
arrow
pinned
one
of
his
fingers
to
the
loom
of
the
steering
oar
just
as
they
were
getting
off
the
fight
had
been
short
but
sharp
the
enemy
lost
two
men
both
shot
dead
the
truth
is
captain
wawn
furnishes
such
a
crowd
of
instances
of
fatal
encounters
between
natives
and
french
and
english
recruiting
crews
for
the
french
are
in
the
business
for
the
plantations
of
new
caledonia
that
one
is
almost
persuaded
that
recruiting
is
not
thoroughly
popular
among
the
islanders
else
why
this
bristling
string
of
attacks
and
bloodcurdling
slaughter
the
captain
lays
it
all
to
exeter
hall
influence
but
for
the
meddling
philanthropists
the
native
fathers
and
mothers
would
be
fond
of
seeing
their
children
carted
into
exile
and
now
and
then
the
grave
instead
of
weeping
about
it
and
trying
to
kill
the
kind

chapter

he
was
as
shy
as
a
newspaper
is
when
referring
to
its
own
merits
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
captain
wawn
is
crystal
clear
on
one
point
he
does
not
approve
of
missionaries
they
obstruct
his
business
they
make
recruiting
as
he
calls
it
slave
catching
as
they
call
it
in
their
frank
way
a
trouble
when
it
ought
to
be
just
a
picnic
and
a
pleasure
excursion
the
missionaries
have
their
opinion
about
the
manner
in
which
the
labor
traffic
is
conducted
and
about
the
recruiter's
evasions
of
the
law
of
the
traffic
and
about
the
traffic
itself
and
it
is
distinctly
uncomplimentary
to
the
traffic
and
to
everything
connected
with
it
including
the
law
for
its
regulation
captain
wawn's
book
is
of
very
recent
date
i
have
by
me
a
pamphlet
of
still
later
date
hot
from
the
press
in
fact
by
rev
wm
gray
a
missionary
and
the
book
and
the
pamphlet
taken
together
make
exceedingly
interesting
reading
to
my
mind
interesting
and
easy
to
understand
except
in
one
detail
which
i
will
mention
presently
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
the
queensland
sugar
planter
should
want
the
kanaka
recruit
he
is
cheap
very
cheap
in
fact
these
are
the
figures
paid
by
the
planter
l20
to
the
recruiter
for
getting
the
kanaka
or
catching
him
as
the
missionary
phrase
goes
l3
to
the
queensland
government
for
superintending
the
importation
l5
deposited
with
the
government
for
the
kanaka's
passage
home
when
his
three
years
are
up
in
case
he
shall
live
that
long
about
l25
to
the
kanaka
himself
for
three
years'
wages
and
clothing
total
payment
for
the
use
of
a
man
three
years
l53
or
including
diet
l60
altogether
a
hundred
dollars
a
year
one
can
understand
why
the
recruiter
is
fond
of
the
business
the
recruit
costs
him
a
few
cheap
presents
given
to
the
recruit's
relatives
not
himself
and
the
recruit
is
worth
l20
to
the
recruiter
when
delivered
in
queensland
all
this
is
clear
enough
but
the
thing
that
is
not
clear
is
what
there
is
about
it
all
to
persuade
the
recruit
he
is
young
and
brisk
life
at
home
in
his
beautiful
island
is
one
lazy
long
holiday
to
him
or
if
he
wants
to
work
he
can
turn
out
a
couple
of
bags
of
copra
per
week
and
sell
it
for
four
or
five
shillings
a
bag
in
queensland
he
must
get
up
at
dawn
and
work
from
eight
to
twelve
hours
a
day
in
the
canefields
in
a
much
hotter
climate
than
he
is
used
to
and
get
less
than
four
shillings
a
week
for
it
i
cannot
understand
his
willingness
to
go
to
queensland
it
is
a
deep
puzzle
to
me
here
is
the
explanation
from
the
planter's
point
of
view
at
least
i
gather
from
the
missionary's
pamphlet
that
it
is
the
planter's
when
he
comes
from
his
home
he
is
a
savage
pure
and
simple
he
feels
no
shame
at
his
nakedness
and
want
of
adornment
when
he
returns
home
he
does
so
well
dressed
sporting
a
waterbury
watch
collars
cuffs
boots
and
jewelry
he
takes
with
him
one
or
more
boxes
[
box
is
english
for
trunk
]
well
filled
with
clothing
a
musical
instrument
or
two
and
perfumery
and
other
articles
of
luxury
he
has
learned
to
appreciate
for
just
one
moment
we
have
a
seeming
flash
of
comprehension
of
the
kanaka's
reason
for
exiling
himself
he
goes
away
to
acquire
civilization
yes
he
was
naked
and
not
ashamed
now
he
is
clothed
and
knows
how
to
be
ashamed
he
was
unenlightened
now
he
has
a
waterbury
watch
he
was
unrefined
now
he
has
jewelry
and
something
to
make
him
smell
good
he
was
a
nobody
a
provincial
now
he
has
been
to
far
countries
and
can
show
off
it
all
looks
plausible
for
a
moment
then
the
missionary
takes
hold
of
this
explanation
and
pulls
it
to
pieces
and
dances
on
it
and
damages
it
beyond
recognition
admitting
that
the
foregoing
description
is
the
average
one
the
average
sequel
is
this
the
cuffs
and
collars
if
used
at
all
are
carried
off
by
youngsters
who
fasten
them
round
the
leg
just
below
the
knee
as
ornaments
the
waterbury
broken
and
dirty
finds
its
way
to
the
trader
who
gives
a
trifle
for
it
or
the
inside
is
taken
out
the
wheels
strung
on

of

him
according
to
the
missionary
he
has
learned
to
swear
this
is
art
and
art
is
long
as
the
poet
says
in
all
countries
the
laws
throw
light
upon
the
past
the
queensland
law
for
the
regulation
of
the
labor
traffic
is
a
confession
it
is
a
confession
that
the
evils
charged
by
the
missionaries
upon
the
traffic
had
existed
in
the
past
and
that
they
still
existed
when
the
law
was
made
the
missionaries
make
a
further
charge
that
the
law
is
evaded
by
the
recruiters
and
that
the
government
agent
sometimes
helps
them
to
do
it
regulation
31
reveals
two
things
that
sometimes
a
young
fool
of
a
recruit
gets
his
senses
back
after
being
persuaded
to
sign
away
his
liberty
for
three
years
and
dearly
wants
to
get
out
of
the
engagement
and
stay
at
home
with
his
own
people
and
that
threats
intimidation
and
force
are
used
to
keep
him
on
board
the
recruiting
ship
and
to
hold
him
to
his
contract
regulation
31
forbids
these
coercions
the
law
requires
that
he
shall
be
allowed
to
go
free
and
another
clause
of
it
requires
the
recruiter
to
set
him
ashore
per
boat
because
of
the
prevalence
of
sharks
testimony
from
rev
mr
gray
there
are
'wrinkles'
for
taking
the
penitent
kanaka
my
first
experience
of
the
traffic
was
a
case
of
this
kind
in
1884
a
vessel
anchored
just
out
of
sight
of
our
station
word
was
brought
to
me
that
some
boys
were
stolen
and
the
relatives
wished
me
to
go
and
get
them
back
the
facts
were
as
i
found
that
six
boys
had
recruited
had
rushed
into
the
boat
the
government
agent
informed
me
they
had
all
'signed'
and
said
the
government
agent
'on
board
they
shall
remain
'
i
was
assured
that
the
six
boys
were
of
age
and
willing
to
go
yet
on
getting
ready
to
leave
the
ship
i
found
four
of
the
lads
ready
to
come
ashore
in
the
boat!
this
i
forbade
one
of
them
jumped
into
the
water
and
persisted
in
coming
ashore
in
my
boat
when
appealed
to
the
government
agent
suggested
that
we
go
and
leave
him
to
be
picked
up
by
the
ship's
boat
a
quarter
mile
distant
at
the
time!
the
law
and
the
missionaries
feel
for
the
repentant
recruit
and
properly
one
may
be
permitted
to
think
for
he
is
only
a
youth
and
ignorant
and
persuadable
to
his
hurt
but
sympathy
for
him
is
not
kept
in
stock
by
the
recruiter
rev
mr
gray
says
a
captain
many
years
in
the
traffic
explained
to
me
how
a
penitent
could
betaken
'when
a
boy
jumps
overboard
we
just
take
a
boat
and
pull
ahead
of
him
then
lie
between
him
and
the
shore
if
he
has
not
tired
himself
swimming
and
passes
the
boat
keep
on
heading
him
in
this
way
the
dodge
rarely
fails
the
boy
generally
tires
of
swimming
gets
into
the
boat
of
his
own
accord
and
goes
quietly
on
board
yes
exhaustion
is
likely
to
make
a
boy
quiet
if
the
distressed
boy
had
been
the
speaker's
son
and
the
captors
savages
the
speaker
would
have
been
surprised
to
see
how
differently
the
thing
looked
from
the
new
point
of
view
however
it
is
not
our
custom
to
put
ourselves
in
the
other
person's
place
somehow
there
is
something
pathetic
about
that
disappointed
young
savage's
resignation
i
must
explain
here
that
in
the
traffic
dialect
boy
does
not
always
mean
boy
it
means
a
youth
above
sixteen
years
of
age
that
is
by
queensland
law
the
age
of
consent
though
it
is
held
that
recruiters
allow
themselves
some
latitude
in
guessing
at
ages

unjust

they
must

he
furnishes
his
reasons
for
his
position
but
they
are
too
long

however
if

most

imperfection
in
the
art
of
swearing
it
must
be
that
all
the
profit
of
the

goes
to
the
white
man
this
could
be
twisted
into
a
plausible
argument
that
the

ought
to
be
squarely
abolished
however
there
is
reason
for
hope
that
that
can
be
left
alone
to
achieve
itself

is
claimed
that
the

he
closes

indictment

is
as
eloquent
in
its
flowerless
straightforward
english
as
is
the
hand
painted
rhapsody
of
the
early
prophet
my
indictment
of
the
queensland
kanaka
labor
traffic
is
this
1
it
generally
demoralizes
and
always
impoverishes
the
kanaka
deprives
him
of
his
citizenship
and
depopulates
the
islands
fitted
to
his
home
2
it
is
felt
to
lower
the
dignity
of
the
white
agricultural
laborer
in
queensland
and
beyond
a
doubt
it
lowers
his
wages
there
3
the
whole
system
is
fraught
with
danger
to
australia
and
the
islands
on
the
score
of
health
4
on
social
and
political
grounds
the
continuance
of
the
queensland
kanaka
labor
traffic
must
be
a
barrier
to
the
true
federation
of
the
australian
colonies
5
the
regulations
under
which
the
traffic
exists
in
queensland
are
inadequate
to
prevent
abuses
and
in
the
nature
of
things
they
must
remain
so
6
the
whole
system
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
and
doctrine
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
the
gospel
requires
us
to
help
the
weak
but
the
kanaka
is
fleeced
and
trodden
down
7
the
bed
rock
of
this
traffic
is
that
the
life
and
liberty
of
a
black
man
are
of
less
value
than
those
of
a
white
man
and
a
traffic
that
has
grown
out
of
'slave
hunting'
will
certainly
remain
to
the
end
not
unlike
its
origin

a

of
clean
white

around

back

a
graceful
fringe

with

nestling
cosily
among

at
their

back
of

a

clothed
in

and

a

perched
high
up

sighted

the

threaded
our

into
the
secluded
little

a
placid
basin
of
brilliant
blue
and
green
water
tucked
snugly
in
among
the
sheltering

a

at

in

one
of

a

flying

said

came
from

there's

duluth
is
several
thousand
miles
from

yet
she
is
entitled
to
the
proud
name
of
mistress
of
the
commercial
marine
of
the
united
states
of
america
there
is
only
one
free
independent
unsubsidized
american
ship
sailing
the
foreign
seas
and
duluth
owns
it
all
by
itself
that
ship
is
the
american
fleet
all
by
itself
it
causes
the
american
name
and
power
to
be
respected
in
the
far
regions
of
the
globe
all
by
itself
it
certifies
to
the
world
that
the
most
populous
civilized
nation
in
the
earth
has
a
just
pride
in
her
stupendous
stretch
of
sea
front
and
is
determined
to
assert
and
maintain
her
rightful
place
as
one
of
the
great
maritime
powers
of
the
planet
all
by
itself
it
is
making
foreign
eyes
familiar
with
a
flag
which
they
have
not
seen
before
for
forty
years
outside
of
the
museum
for
what
duluth
has
done
in
building
equipping
and
maintaining
at
her
sole
expense
the
american
foreign
commercial
fleet
and
in
thus
rescuing
the
american
name
from
shame
and
lifting
it
high
for
the
homage
of
the
nations
we
owe
her
a
debt
of
gratitude
which
our
hearts
shall
confess
with
quickened
beats
whenever
her
name
is
named
henceforth
many
national
toasts
will
die
in
the
lapse
of

but
while

flies

there
we
saw
more
natives
wrinkled
old
women
with
their
flat
mammals
flung
over
their
shoulders
or
hanging
down
in
front
like
the
cold
weather
drip
from
the
molasses
faucet
plump
and
smily
young
girls
blithe
and
content
easy
and
graceful
a
pleasure
to
look
at
young
matrons
tall
straight
comely
nobly
built
sweeping
by
with
chin
up
and
a
gait
incomparable
for
unconscious
stateliness
and
dignity
majestic
young
men
athletes
for
build
and
muscle
clothed
in
a
loose
arrangement
of
dazzling
white
with
bronze
breast
and
bronze
legs
naked
and
the
head
a
cannon
swab
of
solid
hair
combed
straight
out
from
the
skull
and
dyed
a
rich
brick
red
only
sixty
years
ago
they
were
sunk
in
darkness
now
they
have
the
bicycle
we
strolled
about
the
streets
of
the
white
folks'
little
town
and
around
over
the
hills
by
paths
and
roads
among
european
dwellings
and
gardens
and
plantations
and
past
clumps
of
hibiscus
that
made
a
body
blink
the
great
blossoms
were
so
intensely
red
and
by
and
by
we
stopped
to
ask
an
elderly
english
colonist
a
question
or
two
and
to
sympathize
with
him
concerning
the
torrid
weather
but
he
was
surprised
and
said
this
this
is
not
hot
you
ought
to
be
here
in
the
summer
time
once
we
supposed
that
this
was
summer
it
has
the
ear
marks
of
it
you
could
take
it
to
almost
any
country
and
deceive
people
with
it
but
if
it
isn't
summer
what
does
it
lack
it
lacks
half
a
year
this
is
mid
winter
i
had
been
suffering
from
colds
for
several
months
and
a
sudden
change
of
season
like
this
could
hardly
fail
to
do
me
hurt
it
brought
on
another
cold
it
is
odd
these
sudden
jumps
from
season
to
season
a
fortnight
ago
we
left
america
in
mid
summer
now
it
is
midwinter
about
a
week
hence
we
shall
arrive
in
australia
in
the
spring
after
dinner
i
found
in
the
billiard
room
a
resident
whom
i
had
known
somewhere
else
in
the
world
and
presently
made
some
new
friends
and
drove
with
them
out
into
the
country
to
visit
his
excellency
the
head
of
the
state
who
was
occupying
his
country
residence
to
escape
the
rigors
of
the
winter
weather
i
suppose
for
it
was
on
breezy
high
ground
and
much
more
comfortable
than
the
lower
regions
where
the
town
is
and
where
the
winter
has
full
swing
and
often
sets
a
person's
hair
afire
when
he
takes
off
his
hat
to
bow
there
is
a
noble
and
beautiful
view
of
ocean
and
islands
and
castellated
peaks
from
the
governor's
high
placed
house
and
its
immediate
surroundings
lie
drowsing
in
that
dreamy
repose
and
serenity
which
are
the
charm
of
life
in
the
pacific
islands
one
of
the
new
friends
who
went
out
there
with
me
was
a
large
man
and
i
had
been
admiring
his
size
all
the
way
i
was
still
admiring
it
as
he
stood
by
the
governor
on
the
veranda
talking
then
the
fijian
butler
stepped
out
there
to
announce
tea
and
dwarfed
him
maybe
he
did
not
quite
dwarf
him
but
at
any
rate
the
contrast
was
quite
striking
perhaps
that
dark
giant
was
a
king
in
a
condition
of
political
suspension
i
think
that
in
the
talk
there
on
the
veranda
it
was
said
that
in
fiji
as
in
the
sandwich
islands
native
kings
and
chiefs
are
of
much
grander
size
and
build
than
the
commoners
this
man
was
clothed
in
flowing
white
vestments
and
they
were
just
the
thing
for
him
they
comported
well
with
his
great
stature
and
his
kingly
port
and
dignity
european
clothes
would
have
degraded
him
and
made
him
commonplace
i
know
that
because
they
do
that
with
everybody
that
wears
them
it
was
said
that
the
old
time
devotion
to
chiefs
and
reverence
for
their
persons
still
survive
in
the
native
commoner
and
in
great
force
the
educated
young
gentleman
who
is
chief
of
the
tribe
that
live
in
the
region
about
the
capital
dresses
in
the
fashion
of
high
class
european
gentlemen
but
even
his
clothes
cannot
damn
him
in
the
reverence
of
his
people
their
pride
in
his
lofty
rank
and
ancient
lineage
lives
on
in
spite
of
his
lost
authority
and
the
evil
magic
of
his
tailor
he
has
no
need
to
defile
himself
with
work
or
trouble
his
heart
with
the
sordid
cares
of
life
the
tribe
will
see
to
it
that
he
shall
not
want
and
that
he
shall
hold
up
his
head
and
live
like
a
gentleman
i
had
a
glimpse
of
him
down
in
the
town
perhaps
he
is
a
descendant
of
the
last
king
the
king
with
the
difficult
name
whose
memory
is
preserved
by
a
notable
monument
of
cut
stone
which
one
sees
in
the
enclosure
in
the
middle
of
the
town
thakombau
i
remember
now
that
is
the
name
it
is
easier
to
preserve
it
on
a
granite
block
than
in
your
head
fiji
was
ceded
to
england
by
this
king
in
1858
one
of
the
gentlemen
present
at
the
governor's
quoted
a
remark
made
by
the
king
at
the
time
of
the
session
a
neat
retort
and
with
a
touch
of
pathos
in
it
too
the
english
commissioner
had
offered
a
crumb
of
comfort
to
thakombau
by
saying
that
the
transfer
of
the
kingdom
to
great
britain
was
merely
a
sort
of
hermit
crab
formality
you
know
yes
said
poor
thakombau
but
with
this
difference
the
crab
moves
into
an
unoccupied
shell
but
mine
isn't
however
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
from
the
books
the
king
was
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
at
the
time
and
hadn't
much
choice
he
owed
the
united
states
a
large
debt
a
debt
which
he
could
pay
if
allowed
time
but
time
was
denied
him
he
must
pay
up
right
away
or
the
warships
would
be
upon
him
to
protect
his
people
from
this
disaster
he
ceded
his
country
to
britain
with
a
clause
in
the
contract
providing
for
the
ultimate
payment
of
the
american
debt
in
old
times
the
fijians
were
fierce
fighters
they
were
very
religious
and
worshiped
idols
the
big
chiefs
were
proud
and
haughty
and
they
were
men
of
great
style
in
many
ways
all
chiefs
had
several
wives
the
biggest
chiefs
sometimes
had
as
many
as
fifty
when
a
chief
was
dead
and
ready
for
burial
four
or
five
of
his
wives
were
strangled
and
put
into
the
grave
with
him
in
1804
twenty
seven
british
convicts
escaped
from
australia
to
fiji
and
brought
guns
and
ammunition
with
them
consider
what
a
power
they
were
armed
like
that
and
what
an
opportunity
they
had
if
they
had
been
energetic
men
and
sober
and
had
had
brains
and
known
how
to
use
them
they
could
have
achieved
the
sovereignty
of
the
archipelago
twenty
seven
kings
and
each
with
eight
or
nine
islands
under
his
scepter
but
nothing
came
of
this
chance
they
lived
worthless
lives
of
sin
and
luxury
and
died
without
honor
in
most
cases
by
violence
only
one
of
them
had
any
ambition
he
was
an
irishman
named
connor
he
tried
to
raise
a
family
of
fifty
children
and
scored
forty
eight
he
died
lamenting
his
failure
it
was
a
foolish
sort
of
avarice
many
a
father
would
have
been
rich
enough
with
forty
it
is
a
fine
race
the
fijians
with
brains
in
their
heads
and
an
inquiring
turn
of
mind
it
appears
that
their
savage
ancestors
had
a
doctrine
of
immortality
in
their
scheme
of
religion
with
limitations
that
is
to
say
their
dead
friend
would
go
to
a
happy
hereafter
if
he
could
be
accumulated
but
not
otherwise
they
drew
the
line
they
thought
that
the
missionary's
doctrine
was
too
sweeping
too
comprehensive
they
called
his
attention
to
certain
facts
for
instance
many
of
their
friends
had
been
devoured
by
sharks
the
sharks
in
their
turn
were
caught
and
eaten
by
other
men
later
these
men
were
captured
in
war
and
eaten
by
the
enemy
the
original
persons
had
entered
into
the
composition
of
the
sharks
next
they
and
the
sharks
had
become
part
of
the
flesh
and
blood
and
bone
of
the
cannibals
how
then
could
the
particles
of
the
original
men
be
searched
out
from
the
final
conglomerate
and
put
together
again
the
inquirers
were
full
of
doubts
and
considered
that
the
missionary
had
not
examined
the
matter
with
the
gravity
and
attention
which
so
serious
a
thing
deserved
the
missionary
taught
these
exacting
savages
many
valuable
things
and
got
from
them
one
a
very
dainty
and
poetical
idea
those
wild
and
ignorant
poor
children
of
nature
believed
that
the
flowers
after
they
perish
rise
on
the
winds
and
float
away
to
the
fair
fields
of
heaven
and
flourish
there
forever
in
immortal
beauty!

it
could
probably
be
shown
by
facts
and
figures
that
there
is
no
distinctly
native
american
criminal
class
except
congress
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
when
one
glances
at
the
map
the
members
of
the
stupendous
island
wilderness
of
the
pacific
seem
to
crowd
upon
each
other
but
no
there
is
no
crowding
even
in
the
center
of
a
group
and
between
groups
there
are
lonely
wide
deserts
of
sea
not
everything
is
known
about
the
islands
their
peoples
and
their
languages
a
startling
reminder
of
this
is
furnished
by
the
fact
that
in
fiji
twenty
years
ago
were
living
two
strange
and
solitary
beings
who
came
from
an
unknown
country
and
spoke
an
unknown
language
they
were
picked
up
by
a
passing
vessel
many
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
known
land
floating
in
the
same
tiny
canoe
in
which
they
had
been
blown
out
to
sea
when
found
they
were
but
skin
and
bone
no
one
could
understand
what
they
said
and
they
have
never
named
their
country
or
if
they
have
the
name
does
not
correspond
with
that
of
any
island
on
any
chart
they
are
now
fat
and
sleek
and
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
in
the
ship's
log
there
is
an
entry
of
the
latitude
and
longitude
in
which
they
were
found
and
this
is
probably
all
the
clue
they
will
ever
have
to
their
lost
homes
[forbes's
two
years
in
fiji
]
what
a
strange
and
romantic
episode
it
is
and
how
one
is
tortured
with
curiosity
to
know
whence
those
mysterious
creatures
came
those
men
without
a
country
errant
waifs
who
cannot
name
their
lost
home
wandering
children
of
nowhere
indeed
the
island
wilderness
is
the
very
home
of
romance
and
dreams
and
mystery
the
loneliness
the
solemnity
the
beauty
and
the
deep
repose
of
this
wilderness
have
a
charm
which
is
all
their
own
for
the
bruised
spirit
of
men
who
have
fought
and
failed
in
the
struggle
for
life
in
the
great
world
and
for
men
who
have
been
hunted
out
of
the
great
world
for
crime
and
for
other
men
who
love
an
easy
and
indolent
existence
and
for
others
who
love
a
roving
free
life
and
stir
and
change
and
adventure
and
for
yet
others
who
love
an
easy
and
comfortable
career
of
trading
and
money
getting
mixed
with
plenty
of
loose
matrimony
by
purchase
divorce
without
trial
or
expense
and
limitless
spreeing
thrown
in
to
make
life
ideally
perfect
we
sailed
again
refreshed
the
most
cultivated
person
in
the
ship
was
a
young
english
man
whose
home
was
in
new
zealand
he
was
a
naturalist
his
learning
in
his
specialty
was
deep
and
thorough
his
interest
in
his
subject
amounted
to
a
passion
he
had
an
easy
gift
of
speech
and
so
when
he
talked
about
animals
it
was
a
pleasure
to
listen
to
him
and
profitable
too
though
he
was
sometimes
difficult
to
understand
because
now
and
then
he
used
scientific
technicalities
which
were
above
the
reach
of
some
of
us
they
were
pretty
sure
to
be
above
my
reach
but
as
he
was
quite
willing
to
explain
them
i
always
made
it
a
point
to
get
him
to
do
it
i
had
a
fair
knowledge
of
his
subject
layman's
knowledge
to
begin
with
but
it
was
his
teachings
which
crystalized
it
into
scientific
form
and
clarity
in
a
word
gave
it
value
his
special
interest
was
the
fauna
of
australasia
and
his
knowledge
of
the
matter
was
as
exhaustive
as
it
was
accurate
i
already
knew
a
good
deal
about
the
rabbits
in
australasia
and
their
marvelous
fecundity
but
in
my
talks
with
him
i
found
that
my
estimate
of
the
great
hindrance
and
obstruction
inflicted
by
the
rabbit
pest
upon
traffic
and
travel
was
far
short
of
the
facts
he
told
me
that
the
first
pair
of
rabbits
imported
into
australasia
bred
so
wonderfully
that
within
six
months
rabbits
were
so
thick
in
the
land
that
people
had
to
dig
trenches
through
them
to
get
from
town
to
town
he
told
me
a
great
deal
about
worms
and
the
kangaroo
and
other
coleoptera
and
said
he
knew
the
history
and
ways
of
all
such
pachydermata
he
said
the
kangaroo
had
pockets
and
carried
its
young
in
them
when
it
couldn't
get
apples
and
he
said
that
the
emu
was
as
big
as
an
ostrich
and
looked
like
one
and
had
an
amorphous
appetite
and
would
eat
bricks
also
that
the
dingo
was
not
a
dingo
at
all
but
just
a
wild
dog
and
that
the
only
difference
between
a
dingo
and
a
dodo
was
that
neither
of
them
barked
otherwise
they
were
just
the
same
he
said
that
the
only
game
bird
in
australia
was
the
wombat
and
the
only
song
bird
the
larrikin
and
that
both
were
protected
by
government
the
most
beautiful
of
the
native
birds
was
the
bird
of
paradise
next
came
the
two
kinds
of
lyres
not
spelt
the
same
he
said
the
one
kind
was
dying
out
the
other
thickening
up
he
explained
that
the
sundowner
was
not
a
bird
it
was
a
man
sundowner
was
merely
the
australian
equivalent
of
our
word
tramp
he
is
a
loafer
a
hard
drinker
and
a
sponge
he
tramps
across
the
country
in
the
sheep
shearing
season
pretending
to
look
for
work
but
he
always
times
himself
to
arrive
at
a
sheep
run
just
at
sundown
when
the
day's
labor
ends
all
he
wants
is
whisky
and
supper
and
bed
and
breakfast
he
gets
them
and
then
disappears
the
naturalist
spoke
of
the
bell
bird
the
creature
that
at
short
intervals
all
day
rings
out
its
mellow
and
exquisite
peal
from
the
deeps
of
the
forest
it
is
the
favorite
and
best
friend
of
the
weary
and
thirsty
sundowner
for
he
knows
that
wherever
the
bell
bird
is
there
is
water
and
he
goes
somewhere
else
the
naturalist
said
that
the
oddest
bird
in
australasia
was
the
laughing
jackass
and
the
biggest
the
now
extinct
great
moa
the
moa
stood
thirteen
feet
high
and
could
step
over
an
ordinary
man's
head
or
kick
his
hat
off
and
his
head
too
for
that
matter
he
said
it
was
wingless
but
a
swift
runner
the
natives
used
to
ride
it
it
could
make
forty
miles
an
hour
and
keep
it
up
for
four
hundred
miles
and
come
out
reasonably
fresh
it
was
still
in
existence
when
the
railway
was
introduced
into
new
zealand
still
in
existence
and
carrying
the
mails
the
railroad
began
with
the
same
schedule
it
has
now
two
expresses
a
week
time
twenty
miles
an
hour
the
company
exterminated
the
moa
to
get
the
mails
speaking
of
the
indigenous
coneys
and
bactrian
camels
the
naturalist
said
that
the
coniferous
and
bacteriological
output
of
australasia
was
remarkable
for
its
many
and
curious
departures
from
the
accepted
laws
governing
these
species
of
tubercles
but
that
in
his
opinion
nature's
fondness
for
dabbling
in
the
erratic
was
most
notably
exhibited
in
that
curious
combination
of
bird
fish
amphibian
burrower
crawler
quadruped
and
christian
called
the
ornithorhynchus
grotesquest
of
animals
king
of
the
animalculae
of
the
world
for
versatility
of
character
and
make

you
can
call
it
anything
you
want
to
and
be
right
it
is
a
fish
for
it
lives
in
the
river
half
the
time
it
is
a
land
animal
for
it
resides
on
the
land
half
the
time
it
is
an
amphibian
since
it
likes
both
and
does
not
know
which
it
prefers
it
is
a
hybernian
for
when
times
are
dull
and
nothing
much
going
on
it
buries
itself
under
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
a
puddle
and
hybernates
there
a
couple
of
weeks
at
a
time
it
is
a
kind
of
duck
for
it
has
a
duck
bill
and
four
webbed
paddles
it
is
a
fish
and
quadruped
together
for
in
the
water
it
swims
with
the
paddles
and
on
shore
it
paws
itself
across
country
with
them
it
is
a
kind
of
seal
for
it
has
a
seal's
fur
it
is
carnivorous
herbivorous
insectivorous
and
vermifuginous
for
it
eats
fish
and
grass
and
butterflies
and
in
the
season
digs
worms
out
of
the
mud
and
devours
them
it
is
clearly
a
bird
for
it
lays
eggs
and
hatches
them
it
is
clearly
a
mammal
for
it
nurses
its
young
and
it
is
manifestly
a
kind
of
christian
for
it
keeps
the
sabbath
when
there
is
anybody
around
and
when
there
isn't
doesn't
it
has
all
the
tastes
there
are
except
refined
ones
it
has
all
the
habits
there
are
except
good
ones
it
is
a
survival
a
survival
of
the
fittest
mr
darwin
invented
the
theory
that
goes
by
that
name
but
the
ornithorhynchus
was
the
first
to
put
it
to
actual
experiment
and
prove
that
it
could
be
done
hence
it
should
have
as
much
of
the
credit
as
mr
darwin
it
was
never
in
the
ark
you
will
find
no
mention
of
it
there
it
nobly
stayed
out
and
worked
the
theory
of
all
creatures
in
the
world
it
was
the
only
one
properly
equipped
for
the
test
the
ark
was
thirteen
months
afloat
and
all
the
globe
submerged
no
land
visible
above
the
flood
no
vegetation
no
food
for
a
mammal
to
eat
nor
water
for
a
mammal
to
drink
for
all
mammal
food
was
destroyed
and
when
the
pure
floods
from
heaven
and
the
salt
oceans
of
the
earth
mingled
their
waters
and
rose
above
the
mountain
tops
the
result
was
a
drink
which
no
bird
or
beast
of
ordinary
construction
could
use
and
live
but
this
combination
was
nuts
for
the
ornithorhynchus
if
i
may
use
a
term
like
that
without
offense
its
river
home
had
always
been
salted
by
the
flood
tides
of
the
sea
on
the
face
of
the
noachian
deluge
innumerable
forest
trees
were
floating
upon
these
the
ornithorhynchus
voyaged
in
peace
voyaged
from
clime
to
clime
from
hemisphere
to
hemisphere
in
contentment
and
comfort
in
virile
interest
in
the
constant
change
of
scene
in
humble
thankfulness
for
its
privileges
in
ever
increasing
enthusiasm
in
the
development
of
the
great
theory
upon
whose
validity
it
had
staked
its
life
its
fortunes
and
its
sacred
honor
if
i
may
use
such
expressions
without
impropriety
in
connection
with
an
episode
of
this
nature
it
lived
the
tranquil
and
luxurious
life
of
a
creature
of
independent
means
of
things
actually
necessary
to
its
existence
and
its
happiness
not
a
detail
was
wanting
when
it
wished
to
walk
it
scrambled
along
the
tree
trunk
it
mused
in
the
shade
of
the
leaves
by
day
it
slept
in
their
shelter
by
night
when
it
wanted
the
refreshment
of
a
swim
it
had
it
it
ate
leaves
when
it
wanted
a
vegetable
diet
it
dug
under
the
bark
for
worms
and
grubs
when
it
wanted
fish
it
caught
them
when
it
wanted
eggs
it
laid
them
if
the
grubs
gave
out
in
one
tree
it
swam
to
another
and
as
for
fish
the
very
opulence
of
the
supply
was
an
embarrassment
and
finally
when
it
was
thirsty
it
smacked
its
chops
in
gratitude
over
a
blend
that
would
have
slain
a
crocodile
when
at
last
after
thirteen
months
of
travel
and
research
in
all
the
zones
it
went
aground
on
a
mountain
summit
it
strode
ashore
saying
in
its
heart
'let
them
that
come
after
me
invent
theories
and
dream
dreams
about
the
survival
of
the
fittest
if
they
like
but
i
am
the
first
that
has
done
it!
this
wonderful
creature
dates
back
like
the
kangaroo
and
many
other
australian
hydrocephalous
invertebrates
to
an
age
long
anterior
to
the
advent
of
man
upon
the
earth
they
date
back
indeed
to
a
time
when
a
causeway
hundreds
of
miles
wide
and
thousands
of
miles
long
joined
australia
to
africa
and
the
animals
of
the
two
countries
were
alike
and
all
belonged
to
that
remote
geological
epoch
known
to
science
as
the
old
red
grindstone
post
pleosaurian
later
the
causeway
sank
under
the
sea
subterranean
convulsions
lifted
the
african
continent
a
thousand
feet
higher
than
it
was
before
but
australia
kept
her
old
level
in
africa's
new
climate
the
animals
necessarily
began
to
develop
and
shade
off
into
new
forms
and
families
and
species
but
the
animals
of
australia
as
necessarily
remained
stationary
and
have
so
remained
until
this
day
in
the
course
of
some
millions
of
years
the
african
ornithorhynchus
developed
and
developed
and
developed
and
sluffed
off
detail
after
detail
of
its
make
up
until
at
last
the
creature
became
wholly
disintegrated
and
scattered
whenever
you
see
a
bird
or
a
beast
or
a
seal
or
an
otter
in
africa
you
know
that
he
is
merely
a
sorry
surviving
fragment
of
that
sublime
original
of
whom
i
have
been
speaking
that
creature
which
was
everything
in
general
and
nothing
in
particular
the
opulently
endowed
'e
pluribus
unum'
of
the
animal
world
such
is
the
history
of
the
most
hoary
the
most
ancient
the
most
venerable
creature
that
exists
in
the
earth
today
ornithorhynchus
platypus
extraordinariensis
whom
god
preserve!
when
he
was
strongly
moved
he
could
rise
and
soar
like
that
with
ease
and
not
only
in
the
prose
form
but
in
the
poetical
as
well
he
had
written
many
pieces
of
poetry
in
his
time
and
these
manuscripts
he
lent
around
among
the
passengers
and
was
willing
to
let
them
be
copied
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
least
technical
one
in
the
series
and
the
one
which
reached
the
loftiest
note
perhaps
was
his
invocation
come
forth
from
thy
oozy
couch
o
ornithorhynchus
dear!
and
greet
with
a
cordial
claw
the
stranger
that
longs
to
hear
from
thy
own
own
lips
the
tale
of
thy
origin
all
unknown

misplaced

should
be

perhaps
no
poet
is
a
conscious
plagiarist
but
there
seems
to
be
warrant
for
suspecting
that
there
is
no
poet
who
is
not
at
one
time
or
another
an
unconscious
one
the
above
verses
are
indeed
beautiful
and
in
a
way
touching
but
there
is
a
haunting
something
about
them
which
unavoidably
suggests
the
sweet
singer
of
michigan
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
author
had
read
the
works
of
that
poet
and
been
impressed
by
them
it
is
not
apparent
that
he
has
borrowed
from
them
any
word
or
yet
any
phrase
but
the
style
and
swing
and
mastery
and
melody
of
the
sweet
singer
all
are
there
compare
this
invocation
with
frank
dutton

i
think
the
reader
will
feel
convinced
that

night
close
to

now
sydney
50
miles
distant
that
note
recalls
an
experience
the
passengers
were
sent
for
to
come
up
in
the
bow
and
see
a
fine
sight
it
was
very
dark
one
could
not
follow
with
the
eye
the
surface
of
the
sea
more
than
fifty
yards
in
any
direction
it
dimmed
away
and
became
lost
to
sight
at
about
that
distance
from
us
but
if
you
patiently
gazed
into
the
darkness
a
little
while
there
was
a
sure
reward
for
you
presently
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
you
would
see
a
blinding
splash
or
explosion
of
light
on
the
water
a
flash
so
sudden
and
so
astonishingly
brilliant
that
it
would
make
you
catch
your
breath
then
that
blotch
of
light
would
instantly
extend
itself
and
take
the
corkscrew
shape
and
imposing
length
of
the
fabled
sea
serpent
with
every
curve
of
its
body
and
the
break
spreading
away
from
its
head
and
the
wake
following
behind
its
tail
clothed
in
a
fierce
splendor
of
living
fire
and
my
but
it
was
coming
at
a
lightning
gait!
almost
before
you
could
think
this
monster
of
light
fifty
feet
long
would
go
flaming
and
storming
by
and
suddenly
disappear
and
out
in
the
distance
whence
he
came
you
would
see
another
flash
and
another
and
another
and
another
and
see
them
turn
into
sea
serpents
on
the
instant
and
once
sixteen
flashed
up
at
the
same
time
and
came
tearing
towards
us
a
swarm
of
wiggling
curves
a
moving
conflagration
a
vision
of
bewildering
beauty
a
spectacle
of
fire
and
energy
whose
equal
the
most
of
those
people
will
not
see
again
until
after
they
are
dead
it
was
porpoises
porpoises
aglow
with
phosphorescent
light
they
presently
collected
in
a
wild
and
magnificent
jumble
under
the
bows
and
there
they
played
for
an
hour
leaping
and
frollicking
and
carrying
on
turning
summersaults
in
front
of
the
stem
or
across
it
and
never
getting
hit
never
making
a
miscalculation
though
the
stem
missed
them
only
about
an
inch
as
a
rule
they
were
porpoises
of
the
ordinary
length
eight
or
ten
feet
but
every
twist
of
their
bodies
sent
a
long
procession
of
united
and
glowing
curves
astern
that
fiery
jumble
was
an
enchanting
thing
to
look
at
and
we
stayed
out
the
performance
one
cannot
have
such
a
show
as
that
twice
in
a
lifetime
the
porpoise
is
the
kitten
of
the
sea
he
never
has
a
serious
thought
he
cares
for
nothing
but
fun
and
play
but
i
think
i
never
saw
him
at
his
winsomest
until
that
night
it
was
near
a
center
of
civilization
and
he
could
have
been
drinking
by
and
by
when
we
had
approached
to
somewhere
within
thirty
miles
of
sydney
heads
the
great
electric
light
that
is
posted
on
one
of
those
lofty
ramparts
began
to
show
and
in
time
the
little
spark
grew
to
a
great
sun
and
pierced
the
firmament
of
darkness
with
a
far
reaching
sword
of
light
sydney
harbor
is
shut
in
behind
a
precipice
that
extends
some
miles
like
a
wall
and
exhibits
no
break
to
the
ignorant
stranger
it
has
a
break
in
the
middle
but
it
makes
so
little
show
that
even
captain
cook
sailed
by
it
without
seeing
it
near
by
that
break
is
a
false
break
which
resembles
it
and
which
used
to
make
trouble
for
the
mariner
at
night
in
the
early
days
before
the
place
was
lighted
it
caused
the
memorable
disaster
to
the
duncan
dunbar
one
of
the
most
pathetic
tragedies
in
the
history
of
that
pitiless
ruffian
the
sea
the
ship
was
a
sailing
vessel
a
fine
and
favorite
passenger
packet
commanded
by
a
popular
captain
of
high
reputation
she
was
due
from
england
and
sydney
was
waiting
and
counting
the
hours
counting
the
hours
and
making
ready
to
give
her
a
heart
stirring
welcome
for
she
was
bringing
back
a
great
company
of
mothers
and
daughters
the
long
missed
light
and
bloom
of
life
of
sydney
homes
daughters
that
had
been
years
absent
at
school
and
mothers
that
had
been
with
them
all
that
time
watching
over
them
of
all
the
world
only
india
and
australasia
have
by
custom
freighted
ships
and
fleets
with
their
hearts
and
know
the
tremendous
meaning
of
that
phrase
only
they
know
what
the
waiting
is
like
when
this
freightage
is
entrusted
to
the
fickle
winds
not
steam
and
what
the
joy
is
like
when
the
ship
that
is
returning
this
treasure
comes
safe
to
port
and
the
long
dread
is
over
on
board
the
duncan
dunbar
flying
toward
sydney
heads
in
the
waning
afternoon
the
happy
home
comers
made
busy
preparation
for
it
was
not
doubted
that
they
would
be
in
the
arms
of
their
friends
before
the
day
was
done
they
put
away
their
sea
going
clothes
and
put
on
clothes
meeter
for
the
meeting
their
richest
and
their
loveliest
these
poor
brides
of
the
grave
but
the
wind
lost
force
or
there
was
a
miscalculation
and
before
the
heads
were
sighted
the
darkness
came
on
it
was
said
that
ordinarily
the
captain
would
have
made
a
safe
offing
and
waited
for
the
morning
but
this
was
no
ordinary
occasion
all
about
him
were
appealing
faces
faces
pathetic
with
disappointment
so
his
sympathy
moved
him
to
try
the
dangerous
passage
in
the
dark
he
had
entered
the
heads
seventeen
times
and
believed
he
knew
the
ground
so
he
steered
straight
for
the
false
opening
mistaking
it
for
the
true
one
he
did
not
find
out
that
he
was
wrong
until
it
was
too
late
there
was
no
saving
the
ship
the
great
seas
swept
her
in
and
crushed
her
to
splinters
and
rubbish
upon
the
rock
tushes
at
the
base
of
the
precipice
not
one
of
all
that
fair
and
gracious
company
was
ever
seen
again
alive
the
tale
is
told
to
every
stranger
that
passes
the
spot
and
it
will
continue
to
be
told
to
all
that
come
for
generations
but
it
will
never
grow
old
custom
cannot
stale
it
the
heart
break
that
is
in
it
can
never
perish
out
of
it
there
were
two
hundred
persons
in
the
ship
and
but
one
survived
the
disaster
he
was
a
sailor
a
huge
sea
flung
him
up
the
face
of
the
precipice
and
stretched
him
on
a
narrow
shelf
of
rock
midway
between
the
top
and
the
bottom
and
there
he
lay
all
night
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
lain
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
without
chance
of
discovery
but
the
next
morning
the
ghastly
news
swept
through
sydney
that
the
duncan
dunbar
had
gone
down
in
sight
of
home
and
straightway
the
walls
of
the
heads
were
black
with
mourners
and
one
of
these
stretching
himself
out
over
the
precipice
to
spy
out
what
might
be
seen
below
discovered
this
miraculously
preserved
relic
of
the
wreck
ropes
were
brought
and
the
nearly
impossible
feat
of
rescuing
the
man
was
accomplished
he
was
a
person
with
a
practical
turn
of
mind
and
he
hired
a
hall
in
sydney
and
exhibited
himself
at
sixpence
a
head
till
he
exhausted
the
output
of
the
gold
fields
for
that
year
we
entered
and
cast
anchor
and
in
the
morning
went
oh
ing
and
ah
ing
in
admiration
up
through
the
crooks
and
turns
of
the
spacious
and
beautiful
harbor
a
harbor
which
is
the
darling
of
sydney
and
the
wonder
of
the
world
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
people
are
proud
of
it
nor
that
they
put
their
enthusiasm
into
eloquent
words
a
returning
citizen
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
it
and
i
testified
with
a
cordiality
which
i
judged
would
be
up
to
the
market
rate
i
said
it
was
beautiful
superbly
beautiful
then
by
a
natural
impulse
i
gave
god
the
praise
the
citizen
did
not
seem
altogether
satisfied
he
said
it
is
beautiful
of
course
it's
beautiful
the
harbor
but
that
isn't
all
of
it
it's
only
half
of
it
sydney's
the
other
half
and
it
takes
both
of
them
together
to
ring
the
supremacy
bell
god
made
the
harbor
and
that's
all
right
but
satan
made
sydney
of
course
i
made
an
apology
and
asked
him
to
convey
it
to
his
friend
he
was
right
about
sydney
being
half
of
it
it
would
be
beautiful
without
sydney
but
not
above
half
as
beautiful
as
it
is
now
with
sydney
added
it
is
shaped
somewhat
like
an
oak
leaf
a
roomy
sheet
of
lovely
blue
water
with
narrow
off
shoots
of
water
running
up
into
the
country
on
both
sides
between
long
fingers
of
land
high
wooden
ridges
with
sides
sloped
like
graves
handsome
villas
are
perched
here
and
there
on
these
ridges
snuggling
amongst
the
foliage
and
one
catches
alluring
glimpses
of
them
as
the
ship
swims
by
toward
the
city
the
city
clothes
a
cluster
of
hills
and
a
ruffle
of
neighboring
ridges
with
its
undulating
masses
of
masonry
and
out
of
these
masses
spring
towers
and
spires
and
other
architectural
dignities
and
grandeurs
that
break
the
flowing
lines
and
give
picturesqueness
to
the
general
effect
the
narrow
inlets
which
i
have
mentioned
go
wandering
out
into
the
land
everywhere
and
hiding
themselves
in
it
and
pleasure
launches
are
always
exploring
them
with
picnic
parties
on
board
it
is
said
by
trustworthy
people
that
if
you
explore
them
all
you
will
find
that
you
have
covered
700
miles
of
water
passage
but
there
are
liars
everywhere
this
year
and
they
will
double
that
when
their
works
are
in
good
going
order
october
was
close
at
hand
spring
was
come
it
was
really
spring
everybody
said
so
but
you
could
have
sold
it
for
summer
in
canada
and
nobody
would
have
suspected
it
was
the
very
weather
that
makes
our
home
summers
the
perfection
of
climatic
luxury
i
mean
when
you
are
out
in
the
wood
or
by
the
sea
but
these
people
said
it
was
cool
now
a
person
ought
to
see
sydney
in
the
summer
time
if
he
wanted
to
know
what
warm
weather
is
and
he
ought
to
go
north
ten
or
fifteen
hundred
miles
if
he
wanted
to
know
what
hot
weather
is
they
said
that
away
up
there
toward
the
equator
the
hens
laid
fried
eggs
sydney
is
the
place
to
go
to
get
information
about
other
people's
climates
it
seems
to
me
that
the
occupation
of
unbiased
traveler
seeking
information
is
the
pleasantest
and
most
irresponsible
trade
there
is
the
traveler
can
always
find
out
anything
he
wants
to
merely
by
asking
he
can
get
at
all
the
facts
and
more
everybody
helps
him
nobody
hinders
him
anybody
who
has
an
old
fact
in
stock
that
is
no
longer
negotiable
in
the
domestic
market
will
let
him
have
it
at
his
own
price
an
accumulation
of
such
goods
is
easily
and
quickly
made
they
cost
almost
nothing
and
they
bring
par
in
the
foreign
market
travelers
who
come
to
america
always
freight
up
with
the
same
old
nursery
tales
that
their
predecessors
selected
and
they
carry
them
back
and
always
work
them
off
without
any
trouble
in
the
home
market
if
the
climates
of
the
world
were
determined
by
parallels
of
latitude
then
we
could
know
a
place's
climate
by
its
position
on
the
map
and
so
we
should
know
that
the
climate
of
sydney
was
the
counterpart
of
the
climate
of
columbia
s
c
and
of
little
rock
arkansas
since
sydney
is
about
the
same
distance
south
of
the
equator
that
those
other
towns
are
north
of
it
thirty
four
degrees
but
no
climate
disregards
the
parallels
of
latitude
in
arkansas
they
have
a
winter
in
sydney
they
have
the
name
of
it
but
not
the
thing
itself
i
have
seen
the
ice
in
the
mississippi
floating
past
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
river
and
at
memphis
but
a
little
way
above
the
mississippi
has
been
frozen
over
from
bank
to
bank
but
they
have
never
had
a
cold
spell
in
sydney
which
brought
the
mercury
down
to
freezing
point
once
in
a
mid
winter
day
there
in
the
month
of
july
the
mercury
went
down
to
36
deg
and
that
remains
the
memorable
cold
day
in
the
history
of
the
town
no
doubt
little
rock
has
seen
it
below
zero
once
in
sydney
in
mid
summer
about
new
year's
day
the
mercury
went
up
to
106
deg
in
the
shade
and
that
is
sydney's
memorable
hot
day
that
would
about
tally
with
little
rock's
hottest
day
also
i
imagine
my
sydney
figures
are
taken
from
a
government
report
and
are
trustworthy
in
the
matter
of
summer
weather
arkansas
has
no
advantage
over
sydney
perhaps
but
when
it
comes
to
winter
weather
that
is
another
affair
you
could
cut
up
an
arkansas
winter
into
a
hundred
sydney
winters
and
have
enough
left
for
arkansas
and
the
poor
the
whole
narrow
hilly
belt
of
the
pacific
side
of
new
south
wales
has
the
climate
of
its
capital
a
mean
winter
temperature
of
54
deg
and
a
mean
summer
one
of
71
deg
it
is
a
climate
which
cannot
be
improved
upon
for
healthfulness
but
the
experts
say
that
90
deg
in
new
south
wales
is
harder
to
bear
than
112
deg
in
the
neighboring
colony
of
victoria
because
the
atmosphere
of
the
former
is
humid
and
of
the
latter
dry
the
mean
temperature
of
the
southernmost
point
of
new
south
wales
is
the
same
as
that
of
nice
60
deg
yet
nice
is
further
from
the
equator
by
460
miles
than
is
the
former
but
nature
is
always
stingy
of
perfect
climates
stingier
in
the
case
of
australia
than
usual
apparently
this
vast
continent
has
a
really
good
climate
nowhere
but
around
the
edges
if
we
look
at
a
map
of
the
world
we
are
surprised
to
see
how
big
australia
is
it
is
about
two
thirds
as
large
as
the
united
states
was
before
we
added
alaska
but
where
as
one
finds
a
sufficiently
good
climate
and
fertile
land
almost
everywhere
in
the
united
states
it
seems
settled
that
inside
of
the
australian
border
belt
one
finds
many
deserts
and
in
spots
a
climate
which
nothing
can
stand
except
a
few
of
the
hardier
kinds
of
rocks
in
effect
australia
is
as
yet
unoccupied
if
you
take
a
map
of
the
united
states
and
leave
the
atlantic
sea
board
states
in
their
places
also
the
fringe
of
southern
states
from
florida
west
to
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
also
a
narrow
inhabited
streak
up
the
mississippi
half
way
to
its
head
waters
also
a
narrow
inhabited
border
along
the
pacific
coast
then
take
a
brushful
of
paint
and
obliterate
the
whole
remaining
mighty
stretch
of
country
that
lies
between
the
atlantic
states
and
the
pacific
coast
strip
your
map
will
look
like
the
latest
map
of
australia
this
stupendous
blank
is
hot
not
to
say
torrid
a
part
of
it
is
fertile
the
rest
is
desert
it
is
not
liberally
watered
it
has
no
towns
one
has
only
to
cross
the
mountains
of
new
south
wales
and
descend
into
the
westward
lying
regions
to
find
that
he
has
left
the
choice
climate
behind
him
and
found
a
new
one
of
a
quite
different
character
in
fact
he
would
not
know
by
the
thermometer
that
he
was
not
in
the
blistering
plains
of
india
captain
sturt
the
great
explorer
gives
us
a
sample
of
the
heat
the
wind
which
had
been
blowing
all
the
morning
from
the
n
e
increased
to
a
heavy
gale
and
i
shall
never
forget
its
withering
effect
i
sought
shelter
behind
a
large
gum
tree
but
the
blasts
of
heat
were
so
terrific
that
i
wondered
the
very
grass
did
not
take
fire
this
really
was
nothing
ideal
everything
both
animate
and
inanimate
gave
way
before
it
the
horses
stood
with
their
backs
to
the
wind
and
their
noses
to
the
ground
without
the
muscular
strength
to
raise
their
heads
the
birds
were
mute
and
the
leaves
of
the
trees
under
which
we
were
sitting
fell
like
a
snow
shower
around
us
at
noon
i
took
a
thermometer
graded
to
127
deg
out
of
my
box
and
observed
that
the
mercury
was
up
to
125
thinking
that
it
had
been
unduly
influenced
i
put
it
in
the
fork
of
a
tree
close
to
me
sheltered
alike
from
the
wind
and
the
sun
i
went
to
examine
it
about
an
hour
afterwards
when
i
found
the
mercury
had
risen
to
the
top
of
the
instrument
and
had
burst
the
bulb
a
circumstance
that
i
believe
no
traveler
has
ever
before
had
to
record
i
cannot
find
language
to
convey
to
the
reader's
mind
an
idea
of
the
intense
and
oppressive
nature
of
the
heat
that
prevailed
that
hot
wind
sweeps
over
sydney
sometimes
and
brings
with
it
what
is
called
a
dust
storm
it
is
said
that
most
australian
towns
are
acquainted
with
the
dust
storm
i
think
i
know
what
it
is
like
for
the
following
description
by
mr
gape
tallies
very
well
with
the
alkali
duststorm
of
nevada
if
you
leave
out
the
shovel
part
still
the
shovel
part
is
a
pretty
important
part
and
seems
to
indicate
that
my
nevada
storm
is
but
a
poor
thing
after
all
as
we
proceeded
the
altitude
became
less
and
the
heat
proportionately
greater
until
we
reached
dubbo
which
is
only
600
feet
above
sea
level
it
is
a
pretty
town
built
on
an
extensive
plain
after
the
effects
of
a
shower
of
rain
have
passed
away
the
surface
of
the
ground
crumbles
into
a
thick
layer
of
dust
and
occasionally
when
the
wind
is
in
a
particular
quarter
it
is
lifted
bodily
from
the
ground
in
one
long
opaque
cloud
in
the
midst
of
such
a
storm
nothing
can
be
seen
a
few
yards
ahead
and
the
unlucky
person
who
happens
to
be
out
at
the
time
is
compelled
to
seek
the
nearest
retreat
at
hand
when
the
thrifty
housewife
sees
in
the
distance
the
dark
column
advancing
in
a
steady
whirl
towards
her
house
she
closes
the
doors
and
windows
with
all
expedition
a
drawing
room
the
window
of
which
has
been
carelessly
left
open
during
a
dust
storm
is
indeed
an
extraordinary
sight
a
lady
who
has
resided
in
dubbo
for
some
years
says
that
the
dust
lies
so
thick
on
the
carpet
that
it
is
necessary
to
use
a
shovel
to
remove
it
and
probably
a
wagon
i
was
mistaken
i
have
not
seen
a
proper
duststorm
to
my
mind
the
exterior
aspects
and
character
of
australia
are
fascinating
things
to
look
at
and
think
about
they
are
so
strange
so
weird
so
new
so
uncommonplace

a
startling
and
interesting

story

j

english
law
was
hard
hearted
in
those
days
for
trifling
offenses
which
in
our
day
would
be
punished
by
a
small
fine
or
a
few
days'
confinement
men
women
and
boys
were
sent
to
this
other
end
of
the
earth
to
serve
terms
of
seven
and
fourteen
years
and
for
serious
crimes
they
were
transported
for
life
children
were
sent
to
the
penal
colonies
for
seven
years
for
stealing
a
rabbit!
when
i
was
in
london
twenty
three
years
ago
there
was
a
new
penalty
in
force
for
diminishing
garroting
and
wife
beating
25
lashes
on
the
bare
back
with
the
cat
o'
nine
tails
it
was
said
that
this
terrible
punishment
was
able
to
bring
the
stubbornest
ruffians
to
terms
and
that
no
man
had
been
found
with
grit
enough
to
keep
his
emotions
to
himself
beyond
the
ninth
blow
as
a
rule
the
man
shrieked
earlier
that
penalty
had
a
great
and
wholesome
effect
upon
the
garroters
and
wife
beaters
but
humane
modern
london
could
not
endure
it
it
got
its
law
rescinded

cruel
achievement

humanity
twenty
five
lashes!
in
australia
and
tasmania
they
gave
a
convict
fifty
for
almost
any
little
offense
and
sometimes
a
brutal
officer
would
add
fifty
and
then
another
fifty
and
so
on
as
long
as
the
sufferer
could
endure
the
torture
and
live
in
tasmania
i
read
the
entry
in
an
old
manuscript
official
record
of
a
case
where
a
convict
was
given
three
hundred
lashes
for
stealing
some
silver
spoons
and
men
got
more
than
that
sometimes
who
handled
the
cat
often
it
was
another
convict
sometimes
it
was
the
culprit's
dearest
comrade
and
he
had
to
lay
on
with
all
his
might
otherwise
he
would
get
a
flogging
himself
for
his
mercy
for
he
was
under
watch
and
yet
not
do
his
friend
any
good
the
friend
would
be
attended
to
by
another
hand
and
suffer
no
lack
in
the
matter
of
full
punishment
the
convict
life
in
tasmania
was
so
unendurable
and
suicide
so
difficult
to
accomplish
that
once
or
twice
despairing
men
got
together
and
drew
straws
to
determine
which
of
them
should
kill
another
of
the
group
this
murder
to
secure
death
to
the
perpetrator
and
to
the
witnesses
of
it
by
the
hand
of
the
hangman!
the
incidents
quoted
above
are
mere
hints
mere
suggestions
of
what
convict
life
was
like
they
are
but
a
couple
of
details
tossed
into
view
out
of
a
shoreless
sea
of
such
or
to
change
the
figure
they
are
but
a
pair
of
flaming
steeples
photographed
from
a
point
which
hides
from
sight
the
burning
city
which
stretches
away
from
their
bases
on
every
hand
some
of
the
convicts
indeed
a
good
many
of
them
were
very
bad
people
even
for
that
day
but
the
most
of
them
were
probably
not
noticeably
worse
than
the
average
of
the
people
they
left
behind
them
at
home
we
must
believe
this
we
cannot
avoid
it
we
are
obliged
to
believe
that
a
nation
that
could
look
on
unmoved
and
see
starving
or
freezing
women
hanged
for
stealing
twenty
six
cents'
worth
of
bacon
or
rags
and
boys
snatched
from
their
mothers
and
men
from
their
families
and
sent
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
for
long
terms
of

for
similar
trifling

a
nation
to
whom

civilized
could
not
in
any
large
way
be
applied
and
we
must
also
believe
that
a
nation
that
knew
during
more
than
forty
years
what
was
happening
to
those
exiles
and
was
still
content
with
it
was
not
advancing
in
any
showy
way
toward
a
higher
grade
of
civilization
if
we
look
into
the
characters
and
conduct
of
the
officers
and
gentlemen
who
had
charge
of
the
convicts
and
attended
to
their
backs
and
stomachs
we
must
grant
again
that
as
between
the
convict
and
his
masters
and
between
both
and
the
nation
at
home
there
was
a
quite
noticeable
monotony
of
sameness
four
years
had
gone
by
and
many
convicts
had
come
respectable
settlers
were
beginning
to
arrive
these
two
classes
of
colonists
had
to
be
protected
in
case
of
trouble
among
themselves
or
with
the
natives
it
is
proper
to
mention
the
natives
though
they
could
hardly
count
they
were
so
scarce
at
a
time
when
they
had
not
as
yet
begun
to
be
much
disturbed
not
as
yet
being
in
the
way
it
was
estimated
that
in
new
south
wales
there
was
but
one
native
to
45
000
acres
of
territory
people
had
to
be
protected
officers
of
the
regular
army
did
not
want
this
service
away
off
there
where
neither
honor
nor
distinction
was
to
be
gained
so
england
recruited
and
officered
a
kind
of
militia
force
of
1
000
uniformed
civilians
called
the
new
south
wales
corps
and
shipped
it
this
was
the
worst
blow
of
all
the
colony
fairly
staggered
under
it
the
corps
was
an
object
lesson
of
the
moral
condition
of
england
outside
of
the
jails
the
colonists
trembled
it
was
feared
that
next
there
would
be
an
importation
of
the
nobility
in
those
early
days
the
colony
was
non
supporting
all
the
necessaries
of
life
food
clothing
and
all
were
sent
out
from
england
and
kept
in
great
government
store
houses
and
given
to
the
convicts
and
sold
to
the
settlers
sold
at
a
trifling
advance
upon
cost
the
corps
saw
its
opportunity
its
officers
went
into
commerce
and
in
a
most
lawless
way
they
went
to
importing
rum
and
also
to
manufacturing
it
in
private
stills
in
defiance
of
the
government's
commands
and
protests
they
leagued
themselves
together
and
ruled
the
market
they
boycotted
the
government
and
the
other
dealers
they
established
a
close
monopoly
and
kept
it
strictly
in
their
own
hands
when
a
vessel
arrived
with
spirits
they
allowed
nobody
to
buy
but
themselves
and
they
forced
the
owner
to
sell
to
them
at
a
price
named
by
themselves
and
it
was
always
low
enough
they
bought
rum
at
an
average
of
two
dollars
a
gallon
and
sold
it
at
an
average
of
ten
they
made
rum
the
currency
of
the
country
for
there
was
little
or
no
money
and
they
maintained
their
devastating
hold
and
kept
the
colony
under
their
heel
for
eighteen
or
twenty
years
before
they
were
finally
conquered
and
routed
by
the
government
meantime
they
had
spread
intemperance
everywhere
and
they
had
squeezed
farm
after
farm
out
of
the
settlers
hands
for
rum
and
thus
had
bountifully
enriched
themselves
when
a
farmer
was
caught
in
the
last
agonies
of
thirst
they
took
advantage
of
him
and
sweated
him
for
a
drink
in
one
instance
they
sold
a
man
a
gallon
of
rum
worth
two
dollars
for
a
piece
of
property
which
was
sold
some
years
later
for
$100
000
when
the
colony
was
about
eighteen
or
twenty
years
old
it
was
discovered
that
the
land
was
specially
fitted
for
the
wool
culture
prosperity
followed
commerce
with
the
world
began
by
and
by
rich
mines
of
the
noble
metals
were
opened
immigrants
flowed
in
capital
likewise
the
result
is
the
great
and
wealthy
and
enlightened
commonwealth
of
new
south
wales
it
is
a
country
that
is
rich
in
mines
wool
ranches
trams
railways
steamship
lines
schools
newspapers
botanical
gardens

it
is

of

and
of
every
species
of

there
is

should
be
careful

all
around
i
know
by
experience
that
the
description
fits
them
i
will
not
go
more
particularly
into
this
matter
for
i
find
that
when
writers
try
to
distribute
their
gratitude
here
and
there
and
yonder
by
detail
they
run
across
difficulties
and
do
some
ungraceful
stumbling
mr

new

and
victoria
in
1885
tried
to
distribute
his
gratitude
and
was
not
lucky
the
inhabitants
of
sydney
are
renowned
for
their
hospitality
the
treatment
which
we
experienced
at
the
hands
of
this
generous
hearted
people
will
help
more
than
anything
else
to
make
us
recollect
with
pleasure
our
stay
amongst
them
in
the
character
of
hosts
and
hostesses
they
excel
the
'new
chum'
needs
only
the
acquaintanceship
of
one
of
their
number
and
he
becomes
at
once
the
happy
recipient
of
numerous
complimentary
invitations
and
thoughtful
kindnesses
of
the
towns
it
has
been
our
good
fortune
to
visit
none
have
portrayed
home
so
faithfully
as
sydney
nobody
could
say
it
finer
than
that
if
he
had
put
in
his
cork
then
and
stayed
away
from
dubbo
but
no
heedless
man
he
pulled
it
again
pulled
it
when
he
was
away
along
in
his
book
and
his
memory
of
what
he
had
said
about
sydney
had
grown
dim
we
cannot
quit
the
promising
town
of
dubbo
without
testifying
in
warm
praise
to
the
kind
hearted
and
hospitable
usages
of
its
inhabitants
sydney
though
well
deserving
the
character
it
bears
of
its
kindly
treatment
of
strangers
possesses
a
little
formality
and
reserve
in
dubbo
on
the
contrary
though
the
same
congenial
manners
prevail
there
is
a
pleasing
degree
of
respectful
familiarity
which
gives
the
town
a
homely
comfort
not
often
met
with
elsewhere
in
laying
on
one
side
our
pen
we
feel
contented
in
having
been
able
though
so
late
in
this
work
to
bestow
a
panegyric
however
unpretentious
on
a
town
which
though
possessing
no
picturesque
natural
surroundings
nor
interesting
architectural
productions
has
yet
a
body
of
citizens
whose
hearts
cannot
but
obtain
for
their
town
a
reputation
for
benevolence
and
kind
heartedness
i
wonder
what
soured
him
on
sydney
it
seems
strange
that
a
pleasing
degree
of
three
or
four
fingers
of
respectful
familiarity
should
fill
a
man
up
and
give
him
the
panegyrics
so
bad
for
he
has
them
the
worst
way
any
one
can
see
that
a
man
who
is
perfectly
at
himself
does
not
throw
cold
detraction
at
people's
architectural
productions
and
picturesque
surroundings
and
let
on
that
what
he
prefers
is
a
dubbonese
dust
storm
and
a
pleasing
degree
of
respectful
familiarity
no
these
are
old
old
symptoms
and
when
they
appear
we
know
that
the
man
has
got
the
panegyrics
sydney
has
a
population
of
400
000
when
a
stranger
from
america
steps
ashore
there
the
first
thing
that
strikes
him
is
that
the
place
is
eight
or
nine
times
as
large
as
he
was
expecting
it
to
be
and
the
next
thing
that
strikes
him
is
that
it
is
an
english
city
with
american
trimmings
later
on
in
melbourne
he
will
find
the
american
trimmings
still
more
in
evidence
there
even
the
architecture
will
often
suggest
america
a
photograph
of
its
stateliest
business
street
might
be
passed
upon
him
for
a
picture
of
the
finest
street
in
a
large
american
city
i
was
told
that
the
most
of
the
fine
residences
were
the
city
residences
of
squatters
the
name
seemed
out
of
focus
somehow
when
the
explanation
came
it
offered
a
new
instance
of
the
curious
changes
which
words
as
well
as
animals
undergo
through
change
of
habitat
and
climate
with
us
when
you
speak
of
a
squatter
you
are
always
supposed
to
be
speaking
of
a
poor
man
but
in
australia
when
you
speak
of
a
squatter
you
are
supposed
to
be
speaking
of
a
millionaire
in
america
the
word
indicates
the
possessor
of
a
few
acres
and
a
doubtful
title
in
australia
it
indicates
a
man
whose
landfront
is
as
long
as
a
railroad
and
whose
title
has
been
perfected
in
one
way
or
another
in
america
the
word
indicates
a
man
who
owns
a
dozen
head
of
live
stock
in
australia
a
man
who
owns
anywhere
from
fifty
thousand
up
to
half
a
million
head
in
america
the
word
indicates
a
man
who
is
obscure
and
not
important
in
australia
a
man
who
is
prominent
and
of
the
first
importance
in
america
you
take
off
your
hat
to
no
squatter
in
australia
you
do
in
america
if
your
uncle
is
a
squatter
you
keep
it
dark
in
australia
you
advertise
it
in
america
if
your
friend
is
a
squatter
nothing
comes
of
it
but
with
a
squatter
for
your
friend
in
australia
you
may
sup
with
kings
if
there
are
any
around
in
australia
it
takes
about
two
acres
and
a
half
of
pastureland
some
people
say
twice
as
many
to
support
a
sheep
and
when
the
squatter
has
half
a
million
sheep
his
private
domain
is
about
as
large
as
rhode
island
to
speak
in
general
terms
his
annual
wool
crop
may
be
worth
a
quarter
or
a
half
million
dollars
he
will
live
in
a
palace
in
melbourne
or
sydney
or
some
other
of
the
large
cities
and
make
occasional
trips
to
his
sheep
kingdom
several
hundred
miles
away
in
the
great
plains
to
look
after
his
battalions
of
riders
and
shepherds
and
other
hands
he
has
a
commodious
dwelling
out
there
and
if
he
approve
of
you
he
will
invite
you
to
spend
a
week
in
it
and
will
make
you
at
home
and
comfortable
and
let
you
see
the
great
industry
in
all
its
details
and
feed
you
and
slake
you
and
smoke
you
with
the
best
that
money
can
buy
on
at
least
one
of
these
vast
estates
there
is
a
considerable
town
with
all
the
various
businesses
and
occupations
that
go
to
make
an
important
town
and
the
town
and
the
land
it
stands
upon
are
the
property
of
the
squatters
i
have
seen
that
town
and
it
is
not
unlikely
that
there
are
other
squatter
owned
towns
in
australia
australia
supplies
the
world
not
only
with
fine
wool
but
with
mutton
also
the
modern
invention
of
cold
storage
and
its
application
in
ships
has
created
this
great
trade
in
sydney
i
visited
a
huge
establishment
where
they
kill
and
clean
and
solidly
freeze
a
thousand
sheep
a
day
for
shipment
to
england
the
australians
did
not
seem
to
me
to
differ
noticeably
from
americans
either
in
dress
carriage
ways
pronunciation
inflections
or
general
appearance
there
were
fleeting
and
subtle
suggestions
of
their
english
origin
but
these
were
not
pronounced
enough
as
a
rule
to
catch
one's
attention
the
people
have
easy
and
cordial
manners
from
the
beginning
from
the
moment
that
the
introduction
is
completed
this
is
american
to
put
it
in
another
way
it
is
english
friendliness
with
the
english
shyness
and
self
consciousness
left
out
now
and
then
but
this
is
rare
one
hears
such
words
as
piper
for
paper
lydy
for
lady
and
tyble
for
table
fall
from
lips
whence
one
would
not
expect
such
pronunciations
to
come
there
is
a
superstition
prevalent
in
sydney
that
this
pronunciation
is
an
australianism
but
people
who
have
been
home
as
the
native
reverently
and
lovingly
calls
england
know
better
it
is
costermonger
all
over
australasia
this
pronunciation
is
nearly
as
common
among
servants
as
it
is
in
london
among
the
uneducated
and
the
partially
educated
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
that
mislaid
'y'
is
rather
striking
when
a
person
gets
enough
of
it
into
a
short
sentence
to
enable
it
to
show
up
in
the
hotel
in
sydney
the
chambermaid
said
one
morning
the
tyble
is
set
and
here
is
the
piper
and
if
the
lydy
is
ready
i'll
tell
the
wyter
to
bring
up
the
breakfast
i
have
made
passing
mention
a
moment
ago
of
the
native
australasian's
custom
of
speaking
of
england
as
home
it
was
always
pretty
to
hear
it
and
often
it
was
said
in
an
unconsciously
caressing
way
that
made
it
touching
in
a
way
which
transmuted
a
sentiment
into
an
embodiment
and
made
one
seem
to
see
australasia
as
a
young
girl
stroking
mother
england's
old
gray
head
in
the
australasian
home
the
table
talk
is
vivacious
and
unembarrassed
it
is
without
stiffness
or
restraint
this
does
not
remind
one
of
england
so
much
as
it
does
of
america
but
australasia
is
strictly
democratic
and
reserves
and
restraints
are
things
that
are
bred
by
differences
of
rank
english
and
colonial
audiences
are
phenomenally
alert
and
responsive
where
masses
of
people
are
gathered
together
in
england
caste
is
submerged
and
with
it
the
english
reserve
equality
exists
for
the
moment
and
every
individual
is
free
so
free
from
any
consciousness
of
fetters
indeed
that
the
englishman's
habit
of
watching
himself
and
guarding
himself
against
any
injudicious
exposure
of
his
feelings
is
forgotten
and
falls
into
abeyance
and
to
such
a
degree
indeed
that
he
will
bravely
applaud
all
by
himself
if
he
wants
to
an
exhibition
of
daring
which
is
unusual
elsewhere
in
the
world
but
it
is
hard
to
move
a
new
english
acquaintance
when
he
is
by
himself
or
when
the
company
present
is
small
and
new
to
him
he
is
on
his
guard
then
and
his
natural
reserve
is
to
the
fore
this
has
given
him
the
false
reputation
of
being
without
humor
and
without
the
appreciation
of
humor
americans
are
not
englishmen
and
american
humor
is
not
english
humor
but
both
the
american
and
his
humor
had
their
origin
in
england
and
have
merely
undergone
changes
brought
about
by
changed
conditions
and
a
new
environment
about
the
best
humorous
speeches
i
have
yet
heard
were
a
couple
that
were
made
in
australia
at
club
suppers
one
of
them
by
an
englishman
the
other
by
an
australian
chapter
xii
there
are
those
who
scoff
at
the
schoolboy
calling
him
frivolous
and
shallow
yet
it
was
the
schoolboy
who
said
faith
is
believing
what
you
know
ain't
so
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
in
sydney
i
had
a
large
dream
and
in
the
course
of
talk
i
told
it
to
a
missionary
from
india
who
was
on
his
way
to
visit
some
relatives
in
new
zealand
i
dreamed
that
the
visible
universe
is
the
physical
person
of
god
that
the
vast
worlds
that
we
see
twinkling
millions
of
miles
apart
in
the
fields
of
space
are
the
blood
corpuscles
in
his
veins
and
that
we
and
the
other
creatures
are
the
microbes
that
charge
with
multitudinous
life
the
corpuscles
mr
x
the
missionary
considered
the
dream
awhile
then
said
it
is
not
surpassable
for
magnitude
since
its
metes
and
bounds
are
the
metes
and
bounds
of
the
universe
itself
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
almost
accounts
for
a
thing
which
is
otherwise
nearly
unaccountable
the
origin
of
the
sacred
legends
of
the
hindoos
perhaps
they
dream
them
and
then
honestly
believe
them
to
be
divine
revelations
of
fact
it
looks
like
that
for
the
legends
are
built
on
so
vast
a
scale
that
it
does
not
seem
reasonable
that
plodding
priests
would
happen
upon
such
colossal
fancies
when
awake
he
told
some
of
the
legends
and
said
that
they
were
implicitly
believed
by
all
classes
of
hindoos
including
those
of
high
social
position
and
intelligence
and
he
said
that
this
universal
credulity
was
a
great
hindrance
to
the
missionary
in
his
work
then
he
said
something
like
this
at
home
people
wonder
why
christianity
does
not
make
faster
progress
in
india
they
hear
that
the
indians
believe
easily
and
that
they
have
a
natural
trust
in
miracles
and
give
them
a
hospitable
reception
then
they
argue
like
this
since
the
indian
believes
easily
place
christianity
before
them
and
they
must
believe
confirm
its
truths
by
the
biblical
miracles
and
they
will
no
longer
doubt
the
natural
deduction
is
that
as
christianity
makes
but
indifferent
progress
in
india
the
fault
is
with
us
we
are
not
fortunate
in
presenting
the
doctrines
and
the
miracles
but
the
truth
is
we
are
not
by
any
means
so
well
equipped
as
they
think
we
have
not
the
easy
task
that
they
imagine
to
use
a
military
figure
we
are
sent
against
the
enemy
with
good
powder
in
our
guns
but
only
wads
for
bullets
that
is
to
say
our
miracles
are
not
effective
the
hindoos
do
not
care
for
them
they
have
more
extraordinary
ones
of
their
own
all
the
details
of
their
own
religion
are
proven
and
established
by
miracles
the
details
of
ours
must
be
proven
in
the
same
way
when
i
first
began
my
work
in
india
i
greatly
underestimated
the
difficulties
thus
put
upon
my
task
a
correction
was
not
long
in
coming
i
thought
as
our
friends
think
at
home
that
to
prepare
my
childlike
wonder
lovers
to
listen
with
favor
to
my
grave
message
i
only
needed
to
charm
the
way
to
it
with
wonders
marvels
miracles
with
full
confidence
i
told
the
wonders
performed
by
samson
the
strongest
man
that
had
ever
lived
for
so
i
called
him
at
first
i
saw
lively
anticipation
and
strong
interest
in
the
faces
of
my
people
but
as
i
moved
along
from
incident
to
incident
of
the
great
story
i
was
distressed
to
see
that
i
was
steadily
losing
the
sympathy
of
my
audience
i
could
not
understand
it
it
was
a
surprise
to
me
and
a
disappointment
before
i
was
through
the
fading
sympathy
had
paled
to
indifference
thence
to
the
end
the
indifference
remained
i
was
not
able
to
make
any
impression
upon
it
a
good
old
hindoo
gentleman
told
me
where
my
trouble
lay
he
said
'we
hindoos
recognize
a
god
by
the
work
of
his
hands
we
accept
no
other
testimony
apparently
this
is
also
the
rule
with
you
christians
and
we
know
when
a
man
has
his
power
from
a
god
by
the
fact
that
he
does
things
which
he
could
not
do
as
a
man
with
the
mere
powers
of
a
man
plainly
this
is
the
christian's
way
also
of
knowing
when
a
man
is
working
by
a
god's
power
and
not
by
his
own
you
saw
that
there
was
a
supernatural
property
in
the
hair
of
samson
for
you
perceived
that
when
his
hair
was
gone
he
was
as
other
men
it
is
our
way
as
i
have
said
there
are
many
nations
in
the
world
and
each
group
of
nations
has
its
own
gods
and
will
pay
no
worship
to
the
gods
of
the
others
each
group
believes
its
own
gods
to
be
strongest
and
it
will
not
exchange
them
except
for
gods
that
shall
be
proven
to
be
their
superiors
in
power
man
is
but
a
weak
creature
and
needs
the
help
of
gods
he
cannot
do
without
it
shall
he
place
his
fate
in
the
hands
of
weak
gods
when
there
may
be
stronger
ones
to
be
found
that
would
be
foolish
no
if
he
hear
of
gods
that
are
stronger
than
his
own
he
should
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
for
it
is
not
a
light
matter
that
is
at
stake
how
then
shall
he
determine
which
gods
are
the
stronger
his
own
or
those
that
preside
over
the
concerns
of
other
nations
by
comparing
the
known
works
of
his
own
gods
with
the
works
of
those
others
there
is
no
other
way
now
when
we
make
this
comparison
we
are
not
drawn
towards
the
gods
of
any
other
nation
our
gods
are
shown
by
their
works
to
be
the
strongest
the
most
powerful
the
christians
have
but
few
gods
and
they
are
new
new
and
not
strong
as
it
seems
to
us
they
will
increase
in
number
it
is
true
for
this
has
happened
with
all
gods
but
that
time
is
far
away
many
ages
and
decades
of
ages
away
for
gods
multiply
slowly
as
is
meet
for
beings
to
whom
a
thousand
years
is
but
a
single
moment
our
own
gods
have
been
born
millions
of
years
apart
the
process
is
slow
the
gathering
of
strength
and
power
is
similarly
slow
in
the
slow
lapse
of
the
ages
the
steadily
accumulating
power
of
our
gods
has
at
last
become
prodigious
we
have
a
thousand
proofs
of
this
in
the
colossal
character
of
their
personal
acts
and
the
acts
of
ordinary
men
to
whom
they
have
given
supernatural
qualities
to
your
samson
was
given
supernatural
power
and
when
he
broke
the
withes
and
slew
the
thousands
with
the
jawbone
of
an
ass
and
carried
away
the
gate's
of
the
city
upon
his
shoulders
you
were
amazed
and
also
awed
for
you
recognized
the
divine
source
of
his
strength
but
it
could
not
profit
to
place
these
things
before
your
hindoo
congregation
and
invite
their
wonder
for
they
would
compare
them
with
the
deed
done
by
hanuman
when
our
gods
infused
their
divine
strength
into
his
muscles
and
they
would
be
indifferent
to
them
as
you
saw
in
the
old
old
times
ages
and
ages
gone
by
when
our
god
rama
was
warring
with
the
demon
god
of
ceylon
rama
bethought
him
to
bridge
the
sea
and
connect
ceylon
with
india
so
that
his
armies
might
pass
easily
over
and
he
sent
his
general
hanuman
inspired
like
your
own
samson
with
divine
strength
to
bring
the
materials
for
the
bridge
in
two
days
hanuman
strode
fifteen
hundred
miles
to
the
himalayas
and
took
upon
his
shoulder
a
range
of
those
lofty
mountains
two
hundred
miles
long
and
started
with
it
toward
ceylon
it
was
in
the
night
and
as
he
passed
along
the
plain
the
people
of
govardhun
heard
the
thunder
of
his
tread
and
felt
the
earth
rocking
under
it
and
they
ran
out
and
there
with
their
snowy
summits
piled
to
heaven
they
saw
the
himalayas
passing
by
and
as
this
huge
continent
swept
along
overshadowing
the
earth
upon
its
slopes
they
discerned
the
twinkling
lights
of
a
thousand
sleeping
villages
and
it
was
as
if
the
constellations
were
filing
in
procession
through
the
sky
while
they
were
looking
hanuman
stumbled
and
a
small
ridge
of
red
sandstone
twenty
miles
long
was
jolted
loose
and
fell
half
of
its
length
has
wasted
away
in
the
course
of
the
ages
but
the
other
ten
miles
of
it
remain
in
the
plain
by
govardhun
to
this
day
as
proof
of
the
might
of
the
inspiration
of
our
gods
you
must
know
yourself
that
hanuman
could
not
have
carried
those
mountains
to
ceylon
except
by
the
strength
of
the
gods
you
know
that
it
was
not
done
by
his
own
strength
therefore
you
know
that
it
was
done
by
the
strength
of
the
gods
just
as
you
know
that
samson
carried
the
gates
by
the
divine
strength
and
not
by
his
own
i
think
you
must
concede
two
things
first
that
in
carrying
the
gates
of
the
city
upon
his
shoulders
samson
did
not
establish
the
superiority
of
his
gods
over
ours
secondly
that
his
feat
is
not
supported
by
any
but
verbal
evidence
while
hanuman's
is
not
only
supported
by
verbal
evidence
but
this
evidence
is
confirmed
established
proven
by
visible
tangible
evidence
which
is
the
strongest
of
all
testimony
we
have
the
sandstone
ridge
and
while
it
remains
we
cannot
doubt
and
shall
not
have
you
the
gates

chapter
xiii
the
timid
man
yearns
for
full
value
and
asks
a
tenth
the
bold
man
strikes
for
double
value
and
compromises
on
par
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
one
is
sure
to
be
struck
by
the
liberal
way
in
which
australasia
spends
money
upon
public
works
such
as
legislative
buildings
town
halls
hospitals
asylums
parks
and
botanical
gardens
i
should
say
that
where
minor
towns
in
america
spend
a
hundred
dollars
on
the
town
hall
and
on
public
parks
and
gardens
the
like
towns
in
australasia
spend
a
thousand
and
i
think
that
this
ratio
will
hold
good
in
the
matter
of
hospitals
also
i
have
seen
a
costly
and
well
equipped
and
architecturally
handsome
hospital
in
an
australian
village
of
fifteen
hundred
inhabitants
it
was
built
by
private
funds
furnished
by
the
villagers
and
the
neighboring
planters
and
its
running
expenses
were
drawn
from
the
same
sources
i
suppose
it
would
be
hard
to
match
this
in
any
country
this
village
was
about
to
close
a
contract
for
lighting
its
streets
with
the
electric
light
when
i
was
there
that
is
ahead
of
london
london
is
still
obscured
by
gas
gas
pretty
widely
scattered
too
in
some
of
the
districts
so
widely
indeed
that
except
on
moonlight
nights
it
is
difficult
to
find
the
gas
lamps
the
botanical
garden
of
sydney
covers
thirty
eight
acres
beautifully
laid
out
and
rich
with
the
spoil
of
all
the
lands
and
all
the
climes
of
the
world
the
garden
is
on
high
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
town
overlooking
the
great
harbor
and
it
adjoins
the
spacious
grounds
of
government
house
fifty
six
acres
and
at
hand
also
is
a
recreation
ground
containing
eighty
two
acres
in
addition
there
are
the
zoological
gardens
the
race
course
and
the
great
cricket
grounds
where
the
international
matches
are
played
therefore
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
reposeful
lazying
and
lounging
and
for
exercise
too
for
such
as
like
that
kind
of
work
there
are
four
specialties
attainable
in
the
way
of
social
pleasure
if
you
enter
your
name
on
the
visitor's
book
at
government
house
you
will
receive
an
invitation
to
the
next
ball
that
takes
place
there
if
nothing
can
be
proven
against
you
and
it
will
be
very
pleasant
for
you
will
see
everybody
except
the
governor
and
add
a
number
of
acquaintances
and
several
friends
to
your
list
the
governor
will
be
in
england
he
always
is
the
continent
has
four
or
five
governors
and
i
do
not
know
how
many
it
takes
to
govern
the
outlying
archipelago
but
anyway
you
will
not
see
them
when
they
are
appointed
they
come
out
from
england
and
get
inaugurated
and
give
a
ball
and
help
pray
for
rain
and
get
aboard
ship
and
go
back
home
and
so
the
lieutenant
governor
has
to
do
all
the
work
i
was
in
australasia
three
months
and
a
half
and
saw
only
one
governor
the
others
were
at
home
the
australasian
governor
would
not
be
so
restless
perhaps
if
he
had
a
war
or
a
veto
or
something
like
that
to
call
for
his
reserve
energies
but
he
hasn't
there
isn't
any
war
and
there
isn't
any
veto
in
his
hands
and
so
there
is
really
little
or
nothing
doing
in
his
line
the
country
governs
itself
and
prefers
to
do
it
and
is
so
strenuous
about
it
and
so
jealous
of
its
independence
that
it
grows
restive
if
even
the
imperial
government
at
home
proposes
to
help
and
so
the
imperial
veto
while
a
fact
is
yet
mainly
a
name
thus
the
governor's
functions
are
much
more
limited
than
are
a
governor's
functions
with
us
and
therefore
more
fatiguing
he
is
the
apparent
head
of
the
state
he
is
the
real
head
of
society
he
represents
culture
refinement
elevated
sentiment
polite
life
religion
and
by
his
example
he
propagates
these
and
they
spread
and
flourish
and
bear
good
fruit
he
creates
the
fashion
and
leads
it
his
ball
is
the
ball
of
balls
and
his
countenance
makes
the
horse
race
thrive
he
is
usually
a
lord
and
this
is
well
for
his
position
compels
him
to
lead
an
expensive
life
and
an
english
lord
is
generally
well
equipped
for
that
another
of
sydney's
social
pleasures
is
the
visit
to
the
admiralty
house
which
is
nobly
situated
on
high
ground
overlooking
the
water
the
trim
boats
of
the
service
convey
the
guests
thither
and
there
or
on
board
the
flag
ship
they
have
the
duplicate
of
the
hospitalities
of
government
house
the
admiral
commanding
a
station
in
british
waters
is
a
magnate
of
the
first
degree
and
he
is
sumptuously
housed
as
becomes
the
dignity
of
his
office
third
in
the
list
of
special
pleasures
is
the
tour
of
the
harbor
in
a
fine
steam
pleasure
launch
your
richer
friends
own
boats
of
this
kind
and
they
will
invite
you
and
the
joys
of
the
trip
will
make
a
long
day
seem
short
and
finally
comes
the
shark
fishing
sydney
harbor
is
populous
with
the
finest
breeds
of
man
eating
sharks
in
the
world
some
people
make
their
living
catching
them
for
the
government
pays
a
cash
bounty
on
them
the
larger
the
shark
the
larger
the
bounty
and
some
of
the
sharks
are
twenty
feet
long
you
not
only
get
the
bounty
but
everything
that
is
in
the
shark
belongs
to
you
sometimes
the
contents
are
quite
valuable
the
shark
is
the
swiftest
fish
that
swims
the
speed
of
the
fastest
steamer
afloat
is
poor
compared
to
his
and
he
is
a
great
gad
about
and
roams
far
and
wide
in
the
oceans
and
visits
the
shores
of
all
of
them
ultimately
in
the
course
of
his
restless
excursions
i
have
a
tale
to
tell
now
which
has
not
as
yet
been
in
print
in
1870
a
young
stranger
arrived
in
sydney
and
set
about
finding
something
to
do
but
he
knew
no
one
and
brought
no
recommendations
and
the
result
was
that
he
got
no
employment
he
had
aimed
high
at
first
but
as
time
and
his
money
wasted
away
he
grew
less
and
less
exacting
until
at
last
he
was
willing
to
serve
in
the
humblest
capacities
if
so
he
might
get
bread
and
shelter
but
luck
was
still
against
him
he
could
find
no
opening
of
any
sort
finally
his
money
was
all
gone
he
walked
the
streets
all
day
thinking
he
walked
them
all
night
thinking
thinking
and
growing
hungrier
and
hungrier
at
dawn
he
found
himself
well
away
from
the
town
and
drifting
aimlessly
along
the
harbor
shore
as
he
was
passing
by
a
nodding
shark
fisher
the
man
looked
up
and
said
say
young
fellow
take
my
line
a
spell
and
change
my
luck
for
me
how
do
you
know
i
won't
make
it
worse
because
you
can't
it
has
been
at
its
worst
all
night
if
you
can't
change
it
no
harm's
done
if
you
do
change
it
it's
for
the
better
of
course
come
all
right
what
will
you
give
i'll
give
you
the
shark
if
you
catch
one
and
i
will
eat
it
bones
and
all
give
me
the
line
here
you
are
i
will
get
away
now
for
awhile
so
that
my
luck
won't
spoil
yours
for
many
and
many
a
time
i've
noticed
that
if
there
pull
in
pull
in
man
you've
got
a
bite!
i
knew
how
it
would
be
why
i
knew
you
for
a
born
son
of
luck
the
minute
i
saw
you
all
right
he's
landed
it
was
an
unusually
large
shark
a
full
nineteen
footer
the
fisherman
said
as
he
laid
the
creature
open
with
his
knife
now
you
rob
him
young
man
while
i
step
to
my
hamper
for
a
fresh
bait
there's
generally
something
in
them
worth
going
for
you've
changed
my
luck
you
see
but
my
goodness
i
hope
you
haven't
changed
your
own
oh
it
wouldn't
matter
don't
worry
about
that
get
your
bait
i'll
rob
him
when
the
fisherman
got
back
the
young
man
had
just
finished
washing
his
hands
in
the
bay
and
was
starting
away
what
you
are
not
going
yes
good
bye
but
what
about
your
shark
the
shark
why
what
use
is
he
to
me
what
use
is
he
i
like
that
don't
you
know
that
we
can
go
and
report
him
to
government
and
you'll
get
a
clean
solid
eighty
shillings
bounty
hard
cash
you
know
what
do
you
think
about
it
now
oh
well
you
can
collect
it
and
keep
it
is
that
what
you
mean
yes
well
this
is
odd
you're
one
of
those
sort
they
call
eccentrics
i
judge
the
saying
is
you
mustn't
judge
a
man
by
his
clothes
and
i'm
believing
it
now
why
yours
are
looking
just
ratty
don't
you
know
and
yet
you
must
be
rich
i
am
the
young
man
walked
slowly
back
to
the
town
deeply
musing
as
he
went
he
halted
a
moment
in
front
of
the
best
restaurant
then
glanced
at
his
clothes
and
passed
on
and
got
his
breakfast
at
a
stand
up
there
was
a
good
deal
of
it
and
it
cost
five
shillings
he
tendered
a
sovereign
got
his
change
glanced
at
his
silver
muttered
to
himself
there
isn't
enough
to
buy
clothes
with
and
went
his
way
at
half
past
nine
the
richest
wool
broker
in
sydney
was
sitting
in
his
morning
room
at
home
settling
his
breakfast
with
the
morning
paper
a
servant
put
his
head
in
and
said
there's
a
sundowner
at
the
door
wants
to
see
you
sir
what
do
you
bring
that
kind
of
a
message
here
for
send
him
about
his
business
he
won't
go
sir
i've
tried
he
won't
go
that's
why
that's
unusual
he's
one
of
two
things
then
he's
a
remarkable
person
or
he's
crazy
is
he
crazy
no
sir
he
don't
look
it
then
he's
remarkable
what
does
he
say
he
wants
he
won't
tell
sir
only
says
it's
very
important
and
won't
go
does
he
say
he
won't
go
says
he'll
stand
there
till
he
sees
you
sir
if
it's
all
day
and
yet
isn't
crazy
show
him
up
the
sundowner
was
shown
in
the
broker
said
to
himself
no
he's
not
crazy
that
is
easy
to
see
so
he
must
be
the
other
thing
then
aloud
well
my
good
fellow
be
quick
about
it
don't
waste
any
words
what
is
it
you
want
i
want
to
borrow
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
scott!
it's
a
mistake
he
is
crazy
no
he
can't
be
not
with
that
eye
why
you
take
my
breath
away
come
who
are
you
nobody
that
you
know
what
is
your
name
cecil
rhodes
no
i
don't
remember
hearing
the
name
before
now
then
just
for
curiosity's
sake
what
has
sent
you
to
me
on
this
extraordinary
errand
the
intention
to
make
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
for
you
and
as
much
for
myself
within
the
next
sixty
days
well
well
well
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
idea
that
sit
down
you
interest
me
and
somehow
you
well
you
fascinate
me
i
think
that
that
is
about
the
word
and
it
isn't
your
proposition
no
that
doesn't
fascinate
me
it's
something
else
i
don't
quite
know
what
something
that's
born
in
you
and
oozes
out
of
you
i
suppose
now
then
just
for
curiosity's
sake
again
nothing
more
as
i
understand
it
it
is
your
desire
to
bor
i
said
intention
pardon
so
you
did
i
thought
it
was
an
unheedful
use
of
the
word
an
unheedful
valuing
of
its
strength
you
know
i
knew
its
strength
well
i
must
say
but
look
here
let
me
walk
the
floor
a
little
my
mind
is
getting
into
a
sort
of
whirl
though
you
don't
seem
disturbed
any
plainly
this
young
fellow
isn't
crazy
but
as
to
his
being
remarkable
well
really
he
amounts
to
that
and
something
over
now
then
i
believe
i
am
beyond
the
reach
of
further
astonishment
strike
and
spare
not
what
is
your
scheme
to
buy
the
wool
crop
deliverable
in
sixty
days
what
the
whole
of
it
the
whole
of
it
no
i
was
not
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
surprises
after
all
why
how
you
talk!
do
you
know
what
our
crop
is
going
to
foot
up
two
and
a
half
million
sterling
maybe
a
little
more
well
you've
got
your
statistics
right
any
way
now
then
do
you
know
what
the
margins
would
foot
up
to
buy
it
at
sixty
days
the
hundred
thousand
pounds
i
came
here
to
get
right
once
more
well
dear
me
just
to
see
what
would
happen
i
wish
you
had
the
money
and
if
you
had
it
what
would
you
do
with
it
i
shall
make
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
out
of
it
in
sixty
days
you
mean
of
course
that
you
might
make
it
if
i
said
'shall'
yes
by
george
you
did
say
'shall'!
you
are
the
most
definite
devil
i
ever
saw
in
the
matter
of
language
dear
dear
dear
look
here!
definite
speech
means
clarity
of
mind
upon
my
word
i
believe
you've
got
what
you
believe
to
be
a
rational
reason
for
venturing
into
this
house
an
entire
stranger
on
this
wild
scheme
of
buying
the
wool
crop
of
an
entire
colony
on
speculation
bring
it
out
i
am
prepared
acclimatized
if
i
may
use
the
word
why
would
you
buy
the
crop
and
why
would
you
make
that
sum
out
of
it
that
is
to
say
what
makes
you
think
you
i
don't
think
i
know
definite
again
how
do
you
know
because
france
has
declared
war
against
germany
and
wool
has
gone
up
fourteen
per
cent
in
london
and
is
still
rising
oh
in
deed
now
then
i've
got
you!
such
a
thunderbolt
as
you
have
just
let
fly
ought
to
have
made
me
jump
out
of
my
chair
but
it
didn't
stir
me
the
least
little
bit
you
see
and
for
a
very
simple
reason
i
have
read
the
morning
paper
you
can
look
at
it
if
you
want
to
the
fastest
ship
in
the
service
arrived
at
eleven
o'clock
last
night
fifty
days
out
from
london
all
her
news
is
printed
here
there
are
no
war
clouds
anywhere
and
as
for
wool
why
it
is
the
low
spiritedest
commodity
in
the
english
market
it
is
your
turn
to
jump
now
well
why
don't
you
jump
why
do
you
sit
there
in
that
placid
fashion
when
because
i
have
later
news
later
news
oh
come
later
news
than
fifty
days
brought
steaming
hot
from
london
by
the
my
news
is
only
ten
days
old
oh
mun
chausen
hear
the
maniac
talk!
where
did
you
get
it
got
it
out
of
a
shark
oh
oh
oh
this
is
too
much!
front!
call
the
police
bring
the
gun
raise
the
town!
all
the
asylums
in
christendom
have
broken
loose
in
the
single
person
of
sit
down!
and
collect
yourself
where
is
the
use
in
getting
excited
am
i
excited
there
is
nothing
to
get
excited
about
when
i
make
a
statement
which
i
cannot
prove
it
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
begin
to
offer
hospitality
to
damaging
fancies
about
me
and
my
sanity
oh
a
thousand
thousand
pardons!
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
and
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
for
thinking
that
a
little
bit
of
a
circumstance
like
sending
a
shark
to
england
to
fetch
back
a
market
report
what
does
your
middle
initial
stand
for
sir
andrew
what
are
you
writing
wait
a
moment
proof
about
the
shark
and
another
matter
only
ten
lines
there
now
it
is
done
sign
it
many
thanks
many
let
me
see
it
says
it
says
oh
come
this
is
interesting!
why
why
look
here!
prove
what
you
say
here
and
i'll
put
up
the
money
and
double
as
much
if
necessary
and
divide
the
winnings
with
you
half
and
half
there
now
i've
signed
make
your
promise
good
if
you
can
show
me
a
copy
of
the
london
times
only
ten
days
old
here
it
is
and
with
it
these
buttons
and
a
memorandum
book
that
belonged
to
the
man
the
shark
swallowed
swallowed
him
in
the
thames
without
a
doubt
for
you
will
notice
that
the
last
entry
in
the
book
is
dated
'london
'
and
is
of
the
same
date
as
the
times
and
says
'ber
confequentz
der
kreigeseflarun
reife

heute
nach
deutchland
ab
aur
bak
ich
mein

dem

as
clean
native
german
as
anybody
can
put
upon
paper
and
means
that
in
consequence
of
the
declaration
of
war
this
loyal
soul
is
leaving
for
home
to
day
to
fight
and
he
did
leave
too
but
the
shark
had
him
before
the
day
was
done
poor
fellow
and
a
pity
too
but
there
are
times
for
mourning
and
we
will
attend
to
this
case
further
on
other
matters
are
pressing
now
i
will
go
down
and
set
the
machinery
in
motion
in
a
quiet
way
and
buy
the
crop
it
will
cheer
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
boys
in
a
transitory
way
everything
is
transitory
in
this
world
sixty
days
hence
when
they
are
called
to
deliver
the
goods
they
will
think
they've
been
struck
by
lightning
but
there
is
a
time
for
mourning
and
we
will
attend
to
that
case
along
with
the
other
one
come
along
i'll
take
you
to
my
tailor
what
did
you
say
your
name
is
cecil
rhodes
it
is
hard
to
remember
however
i
think
you
will
make
it
easier
by
and
by
if
you
live
there
are
three
kinds
of
people
commonplace
men
remarkable
men
and
lunatics
i'll
classify
you
with
the
remarkables
and
take
the
chances
the
deal
went
through
and
secured
to
the
young
stranger
the
first
fortune
he
ever
pocketed
the
people
of
sydney
ought
to
be
afraid
of
the
sharks
but
for
some
reason
they
do
not
seem
to
be
on
saturdays
the
young
men
go
out
in
their
boats
and
sometimes
the
water
is
fairly
covered
with
the
little
sails
a
boat
upsets
now
and
then
by
accident
a
result
of
tumultuous
skylarking
sometimes
the
boys
upset
their
boat
for
fun
such
as
it
is
with
sharks
visibly
waiting
around
for
just
such
an
occurrence
the
young
fellows
scramble
aboard
whole
sometimes
not
always
tragedies
have
happened
more
than
once
while
i
was
in
sydney
it
was
reported
that
a
boy
fell
out
of
a
boat
in
the
mouth
of
the
paramatta
river
and
screamed
for
help
and
a
boy
jumped
overboard
from
another
boat
to
save
him
from
the
assembling
sharks
but
the
sharks
made
swift
work
with
the
lives
of
both
the
government
pays
a
bounty
for
the
shark
to
get
the
bounty
the
fishermen
bait
the
hook
or
the
seine
with
agreeable
mutton
the
news
spreads
and
the
sharks
come
from
all
over
the
pacific
ocean
to
get
the
free
board
in
time
the
shark
culture
will
be
one
of
the
most
successful
things
in
the
colony
chapter
xiv
we
can
secure
other
people's
approval
if
we
do
right
and
try
hard
but
our
own
is
worth
a
hundred
of
it
and
no
way
has
been
found
out
of
securing
that
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
my
health
had
broken
down
in
new
york
in
may
it
had
remained
in
a
doubtful
but
fairish
condition
during
a
succeeding
period
of
82
days
it
broke
again
on
the
pacific
it
broke
again
in
sydney
but
not
until
after
i
had
had
a
good
outing
and
had
also
filled
my
lecture
engagements
this
latest
break
lost
me
the
chance
of
seeing
queensland
in
the
circumstances
to
go
north
toward
hotter
weather
was
not
advisable
so
we
moved
south
with
a
westward
slant
17
hours
by
rail
to
the
capital
of
the
colony
of
victoria
melbourne
that
juvenile
city
of
sixty
years
and
half
a
million
inhabitants
on
the
map
the
distance
looked
small
but
that
is
a
trouble
with
all
divisions
of
distance
in
such
a
vast
country
as
australia
the
colony
of
victoria
itself
looks
small
on
the
map
looks
like
a
county
in
fact
yet
it
is
about
as
large
as
england
scotland
and
wales
combined
or
to
get
another
focus
upon
it
it
is
just
80
times
as
large
as
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
one
third
as
large
as
the
state
of
texas
outside
of
melbourne
victoria
seems
to
be
owned
by
a
handful
of
squatters
each
with
a
rhode
island
for
a
sheep
farm
that
is
the
impression
which
one
gathers
from
common
talk
yet
the
wool
industry
of
victoria
is
by
no
means
so
great
as
that
of
new
south
wales
the
climate
of
victoria
is
favorable
to
other
great
industries
among
others
wheat
growing
and
the
making
of
wine
we
took
the
train
at
sydney
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
it
was
american
in
one
way
for
we
had
a
most
rational
sleeping
car
also
the
car
was
clean
and
fine
and
new
nothing
about
it
to
suggest
the
rolling
stock
of
the
continent
of
europe
but
our
baggage
was
weighed
and
extra
weight
charged
for
that
was
continental
continental
and
troublesome
any
detail
of
railroading
that
is
not
troublesome
cannot
honorably
be
described
as
continental
the
tickets
were
round
trip
ones
to
melbourne
and
clear
to
adelaide
in
south
australia
and
then
all
the
way
back
to
sydney
twelve
hundred
more
miles
than
we
really
expected
to
make
but
then
as
the
round
trip
wouldn't
cost
much
more
than
the
single
trip
it
seemed
well
enough
to
buy
as
many
miles
as
one
could
afford
even
if
one
was
not
likely
to
need
them
a
human
being
has
a
natural
desire
to
have
more
of
a
good
thing
than
he
needs
now
comes
a
singular
thing
the
oddest
thing
the
strangest
thing
the
most
baffling
and
unaccountable
marvel
that
australasia
can
show
at
the
frontier
between
new
south
wales
and
victoria
our
multitude
of
passengers
were
routed
out
of
their
snug
beds
by
lantern
light
in
the
morning
in
the
biting
cold
of
a
high
altitude
to
change
cars
on
a
road
that
has
no
break
in
it
from
sydney
to
melbourne!
think
of
the
paralysis
of
intellect
that
gave
that
idea
birth
imagine
the
boulder
it
emerged
from
on
some
petrified
legislator's
shoulders
it
is
a
narrow
gage
road
to
the
frontier
and
a
broader
gauge
thence
to
melbourne
the
two
governments
were
the
builders
of
the
road
and
are
the
owners
of
it
one
or
two
reasons
are
given
for
this
curious
state
of
things
one
is
that
it
represents
the
jealousy
existing
between
the
colonies
the
two
most
important
colonies
of
australasia
what
the
other
one
is
i
have
forgotten
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
it
could
be
but
another
effort
to
explain
the
inexplicable
all
passengers
fret
at
the
double
gauge
all
shippers
of
freight
must
of
course
fret
at
it
unnecessary
expense
delay
and
annoyance
are
imposed
upon
everybody
concerned
and
no
one
is
benefitted
each
australian
colony
fences
itself
off
from
its
neighbor
with
a
custom
house
personally
i
have
no
objection
but
it
must
be
a
good
deal
of
inconvenience
to
the
people
we
have
something
resembling
it
here
and
there
in
america
but
it
goes
by
another
name
the
large
empire
of
the
pacific
coast
requires
a
world
of
iron
machinery
and
could
manufacture
it
economically
on
the
spot
if
the
imposts
on
foreign
iron
were
removed
but
they
are
not
protection
to
pennsylvania
and
alabama
forbids
it
the
result
to
the
pacific
coast
is
the
same
as
if
there
were
several
rows
of
custom
fences
between
the
coast
and
the
east
iron
carted
across
the
american
continent
at
luxurious
railway
rates
would
be
valuable
enough
to
be
coined
when
it
arrived
we
changed
cars
this
was
at
albury
and
it
was
there
i
think
that
the
growing
day
and
the
early
sun
exposed
the
distant
range
called
the
blue
mountains
accurately
named
my
word!
as
the
australians
say
but
it
was
a
stunning
color
that
blue
deep
strong
rich
exquisite
towering
and
majestic
masses
of
blue
a
softly
luminous
blue
a
smouldering
blue
as
if
vaguely
lit
by
fires
within
it
extinguished
the
blue
of
the
sky
made
it
pallid
and
unwholesome
whitey
and
washed
out
a
wonderful
color
just
divine
a
resident
told
me
that
those
were
not
mountains
he
said
they
were
rabbit
piles
and
explained
that
long
exposure
and
the
over
ripe
condition
of
the
rabbits
was
what
made
them
look
so
blue
this
man
may
have
been
right
but
much
reading
of
books
of
travel
has
made
me
distrustful
of
gratis
information
furnished
by
unofficial
residents
of
a
country
the
facts
which
such
people
give
to
travelers
are
usually
erroneous
and
often
intemperately
so
the
rabbit
plague
has
indeed
been
very
bad
in
australia
and
it
could
account
for
one
mountain
but
not
for
a
mountain
range
it
seems
to
me
it
is
too
large
an
order
we
breakfasted
at
the
station
a
good
breakfast
except
the
coffee
and
cheap
the
government
establishes
the
prices
and
placards
them
the
waiters
were
men
i
think
but
that
is
not
usual
in
australasia
the
usual
thing
is
to
have
girls
no
not
girls
young
ladies
generally
duchesses
dress
they
would
attract
attention
at
any
royal
levee
in
europe
even
empresses
and
queens
do
not
dress
as
they
do
not
that
they
could
not
afford
it
perhaps
but
they
would
not
know
how
all
the
pleasant
morning
we
slid
smoothly
along
over
the
plains
through
thin
not
thick
forests
of
great
melancholy
gum
trees
with
trunks
rugged
with
curled
sheets
of
flaking
bark
erysipelas
convalescents
so
to
speak
shedding
their
dead
skins
and
all
along
were
tiny
cabins
built
sometimes
of
wood
sometimes
of
gray
blue
corrugated
iron
and
the
doorsteps
and
fences
were
clogged
with
children
rugged
little
simply
clad
chaps
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
imported
from
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
without
breaking
bulk
and
there
were
little
villages
with
neat
stations
well
placarded
with
showy
advertisements
mainly
of
almost
too
self
righteous
brands
of
sheepdip
if
that
is
the
name
and
i
think
it
is
it
is
a
stuff
like
tar
and
is
dabbed
on
to
places
where
the
shearer
clips
a
piece
out
of
the
sheep
it
bars
out
the
flies
and
has
healing
properties
and
a
nip
to
it
which
makes
the
sheep
skip
like
the
cattle
on
a
thousand
hills
it
is
not
good
to
eat
that
is
it
is
not
good
to
eat
except
when
mixed
with
railroad
coffee
it
improves
railroad
coffee
without
it
railroad
coffee
is
too
vague
but
with
it
it
is
quite
assertive
and
enthusiastic
by
itself
railroad
coffee
is
too
passive
but
sheep
dip
makes
it
wake
up
and
get
down
to
business
i
wonder
where
they
get
railroad
coffee
we
saw
birds
but
not
a
kangaroo
not
an
emu
not
an
ornithorhynchus
not
a
lecturer
not
a
native
indeed
the
land
seemed
quite
destitute
of
game
but
i
have
misused
the
word
native
in
australia
it
is
applied
to
australian
born
whites
only
i
should
have
said
that
we
saw
no
aboriginals
no
blackfellows
and
to
this
day
i
have
never
seen
one
in
the
great
museums
you
will
find
all
the
other
curiosities
but
in
the
curio
of
chiefest
interest
to
the
stranger
all
of
them
are
lacking
we
have
at
home
an
abundance
of
museums
and
not
an
american
indian
in
them
it
is
clearly
an
absurdity
but
it
never
struck
me
before
chapter
xv
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
to
some
people
but
i
am
measurably
familiar
with
it
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
but
it
is
because
fiction
is
obliged
to
stick
to
possibilities
truth
isn't
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
the
air
was
balmy
and
delicious
the
sunshine
radiant
it
was
a
charming
excursion
in
the
course
of
it
we
came
to
a
town
whose
odd
name
was
famous
all
over
the
world
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
wagga
wagga
this
was
because
the
tichborne
claimant
had
kept
a
butcher
shop
there
it
was
out
of
the
midst
of
his
humble
collection
of
sausages
and
tripe
that
he
soared
up
into
the
zenith
of
notoriety
and
hung
there
in
the
wastes
of
space
a
time
with
the
telescopes
of
all
nations
leveled
at
him
in
unappeasable
curiosity
curiosity
as
to
which
of
the
two
long
missing
persons
he
was
arthur
orton
the
mislaid
roustabout
of
wapping
or
sir
roger
tichborne
the
lost
heir
of
a
name
and
estates
as
old
as
english
history
we
all
know
now
but
not
a
dozen
people
knew
then
and
the
dozen
kept
the
mystery
to
themselves
and
allowed
the
most
intricate
and
fascinating
and
marvelous
real
life
romance
that
has
ever
been
played
upon
the
world's
stage
to
unfold
itself
serenely
act
by
act
in
a
british
court
by
the
long
and
laborious
processes
of
judicial
development
when
we
recall
the
details
of
that
great
romance
we
marvel
to
see
what
daring
chances
truth
may
freely
take
in
constructing
a
tale
as
compared
with
the
poor
little
conservative
risks
permitted
to
fiction
the
fiction
artist
could
achieve
no
success
with
the
materials
of
this
splendid
tichborne
romance
he
would
have
to
drop
out
the
chief
characters
the
public
would
say
such
people
are
impossible
he
would
have
to
drop
out
a
number
of
the
most
picturesque
incidents
the
public
would
say
such
things
could
never
happen
and
yet
the
chief
characters
did
exist
and
the
incidents
did
happen
it
cost
the
tichborne
estates
$400
000
to
unmask
the
claimant
and
drive
him
out
and
even
after
the
exposure
multitudes
of
englishmen
still
believed
in
him
it
cost
the
british
government
another
$400
000
to
convict
him
of
perjury
and
after
the
conviction
the
same
old
multitudes
still
believed
in
him
and
among
these
believers
were
many
educated
and
intelligent
men
and
some
of
them
had
personally
known
the
real
sir
roger
the
claimant
was
sentenced
to
14
years'
imprisonment
when
he
got
out
of
prison
he
went
to
new
york
and
kept
a
whisky
saloon
in
the
bowery
for
a
time
then
disappeared
from
view
he
always
claimed
to
be
sir
roger
tichborne
until
death
called
for
him
this
was
but
a
few
months
ago
not
very
much
short
of
a
generation
since
he
left
wagga
wagga
to
go
and
possess
himself
of
his
estates
on
his
death
bed
he
yielded
up
his
secret
and
confessed
in
writing
that
he
was
only
arthur
orton
of
wapping
able
seaman
and
butcher
that
and
nothing
more
but
it
is
scarcely
to
be
doubted
that
there
are
people
whom
even
his
dying
confession
will
not
convince
the
old
habit
of
assimilating
incredibilities
must
have
made
strong
food
a
necessity
in
their
case
a
weaker
article
would
probably
disagree
with
them
i
was
in
london
when
the
claimant
stood
his
trial
for
perjury
i
attended
one
of
his
showy
evenings
in
the
sumptuous
quarters
provided
for
him
from
the
purses
of
his
adherents
and
well
wishers
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
i
thought
him
a
rather
fine
and
stately
creature
there
were
about
twenty
five
gentlemen
present
educated
men
men
moving
in
good
society
none
of
them
commonplace
some
of
them
were
men
of
distinction
none
of
them
were
obscurities
they
were
his
cordial
friends
and
admirers
it
was
sir
roger
always
sir
roger
on
all
hands
no
one
withheld
the
title
all
turned
it
from
the
tongue
with
unction
and
as
if
it
tasted
good
for
many
years
i
had
had
a
mystery
in
stock
melbourne
and
only
melbourne
could
unriddle
it
for
me
in
1873
i
arrived
in
london
with
my
wife
and
young
child
and
presently
received
a
note
from
naples
signed
by
a
name
not
familiar
to
me
it
was
not
bascom
and
it
was
not
henry
but
i
will
call
it
henry
bascom
for
convenience's
sake
this
note
of
about
six
lines
was
written
on
a
strip
of
white
paper
whose
end
edges
were
ragged
i
came
to
be
familiar
with
those
strips
in
later
years
their
size
and
pattern
were
always
the
same
their
contents
were
usually
to
the
same
effect
would
i
and
mine
come
to
the
writer's
country
place
in
england
on
such
and
such
a
date
by
such
and
such
a
train
and
stay
twelve
days
and
depart
by
such
and
such
a
train
at
the
end
of
the
specified
time
a
carriage
would
meet
us
at
the
station
these
invitations
were
always
for
a
long
time
ahead
if
we
were
in
europe
three
months
ahead
if
we
were
in
america
six
to
twelve
months
ahead
they
always
named
the
exact
date
and
train
for
the
beginning
and
also
for
the
end
of
the
visit
this
first
note
invited
us
for
a
date
three
months
in
the
future
it
asked
us
to
arrive
by
the
4
10
p
m
train
from
london
august
6th
the
carriage
would
be
waiting
the
carriage
would
take
us
away
seven
days
later
train
specified
and
there
were
these
words
speak
to
tom
hughes
i
showed
the
note
to
the
author
of
tom
brown
at
rugby
and
be
said
accept
and
be
thankful
he
described
mr
bascom
as
being
a
man
of
genius
a
man
of
fine
attainments
a
choice
man
in
every
way
a
rare
and
beautiful
character
he
said
that
bascom
hall
was
a
particularly
fine
example
of
the
stately
manorial
mansion
of
elizabeth's
days
and
that
it
was
a
house
worth
going
a
long
way
to
see
like
knowle
that
mr
b
was
of
a
social
disposition
liked
the
company
of
agreeable
people
and
always
had
samples
of
the
sort
coming
and
going
we
paid
the
visit
we
paid
others
in
later
years
the
last
one
in
1879
soon
after
that
mr
bascom
started
on
a
voyage
around
the
world
in
a
steam
yacht
a
long
and
leisurely
trip
for
he
was
making
collections
in
all
lands
of
birds
butterflies
and
such
things
the
day
that
president
garfield
was
shot
by
the
assassin
guiteau
we
were
at
a
little
watering
place
on
long
island
sound
and
in
the
mail
matter
of
that
day
came
a
letter
with
the
melbourne
post
mark
on
it
it
was
for
my
wife
but
i
recognized
mr
bascom's
handwriting
on
the
envelope
and
opened
it
it
was
the
usual
note
as
to
paucity
of
lines
and
was
written
on
the
customary
strip
of
paper
but
there
was
nothing
usual
about
the
contents
the
note
informed
my
wife
that
if
it
would
be
any
assuagement
of
her
grief
to
know
that
her
husband's
lecture
tour
in
australia
was
a
satisfactory
venture
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
he
the
writer
could
testify
that
such
was
the
case
also
that
her
husband's
untimely
death
had
been
mourned
by
all
classes
as
she
would
already
know
by
the
press
telegrams
long
before
the
reception
of
this
note
that
the
funeral
was
attended
by
the
officials
of
the
colonial
and
city
governments
and
that
while
he
the
writer
her
friend
and
mine
had
not
reached
melbourne
in
time
to
see
the
body
he
had
at
least
had
the
sad
privilege
of
acting
as
one
of
the
pall
bearers
signed
henry
bascom
my
first
thought
was
why
didn't
he
have
the
coffin
opened
he
would
have
seen
that
the
corpse
was
an
imposter
and
he
could
have
gone
right
ahead
and
dried
up
the
most
of
those
tears
and
comforted
those
sorrowing
governments
and
sold
the
remains
and
sent
me
the
money
i
did
nothing
about
the
matter
i
had
set
the
law
after
living
lecture
doubles
of
mine
a
couple
of
times
in
america
and
the
law
had
not
been
able
to
catch
them
others
in
my
trade
had
tried
to
catch
their
impostor
doubles
and
had
failed
then
where
was
the
use
in
harrying
a
ghost
none
and
so
i
did
not
disturb
it
i
had
a
curiosity
to
know
about
that
man's
lecture
tour
and
last
moments
but
that
could
wait
when
i
should
see
mr
bascom
he
would
tell
me
all
about
it
but
he
passed
from
life
and
i
never
saw
him
again
my
curiosity
faded
away
however
when
i
found
that
i
was
going
to
australia
it
revived
and
naturally
for
if
the
people
should
say
that
i
was
a
dull
poor
thing
compared
to
what
i
was
before
i
died
it
would
have
a
bad
effect
on
business
well
to
my
surprise
the
sydney
journalists
had
never
heard
of
that
impostor!
i
pressed
them
but
they
were
firm
they
had
never
heard
of
him
and
didn't
believe
in
him
i
could
not
understand
it
still
i
thought
it
would
all
come
right
in
melbourne
the
government
would
remember
and
the
other
mourners
at
the
supper
of
the
institute
of
journalists
i
should
find
out
all
about
the
matter
but
no
it
turned
out
that
they
had
never
heard
of
it
so
my
mystery
was
a
mystery
still
it
was
a
great
disappointment
i
believed
it
would
never
be
cleared
up
in
this
life
so
i
dropped
it
out
of
my
mind
but
at
last!
just
when
i
was
least
expecting
it
however
this
is
not
the
place
for
the
rest
of
it
i
shall
come
to
the
matter
again
in
a
far
distant
chapter

xvi

moral

is
the
melbourne
cup
that
brings
this
multitude
together
their
clothes
have
been
ordered
long
ago
at
unlimited
cost
and
without
bounds
as
to
beauty
and
magnificence
and
have
been
kept
in
concealment
until
now
for
unto
this
day
are
they
consecrate
i
am
speaking
of
the
ladies'
clothes
but
one
might
know
that
and
so
the
grand
stands
make
a
brilliant
and
wonderful
spectacle
a
delirium
of
color
a
vision
of
beauty
the
champagne
flows
everybody
is
vivacious
excited
happy
everybody
bets
and
gloves
and
fortunes
change
hands
right
along
all
the
time
day
after
day
the
races
go
on
and
the
fun
and
the
excitement
are
kept
at
white
heat
and
when
each
day
is
done
the
people
dance
all
night
so
as
to
be
fresh
for
the
race
in
the
morning
and
at
the
end
of
the
great
week
the
swarms
secure
lodgings
and
transportation
for
next
year
then
flock
away
to
their
remote
homes
and
count
their
gains
and
losses
and
order
next
year's
cup
clothes
and
then
lie
down
and
sleep
two
weeks
and
get
up
sorry
to
reflect
that
a
whole
year
must
be
put
in
somehow
or
other
before
they
can
be
wholly
happy
again
the
melbourne
cup
is
the
australasian
national
day
it
would
be
difficult
to
overstate
its
importance
it
overshadows
all
other
holidays
and
specialized
days
of
whatever
sort
in
that
congeries
of
colonies
overshadows
them
i
might
almost
say
it
blots
them
out
each
of
them
gets
attention
but
not
everybody's
each
of
them
evokes
interest
but
not
everybody's
each
of
them
rouses
enthusiasm
but
not
everybody's
in
each
case
a
part
of
the
attention
interest
and
enthusiasm
is
a
matter
of
habit
and
custom
and
another
part
of
it
is
official
and
perfunctory
cup
day
and
cup
day
only
commands
an
attention
an
interest
and
an
enthusiasm
which
are
universal
and
spontaneous
not
perfunctory
cup
day
is
supreme
it
has
no
rival
i
can
call
to
mind
no
specialized
annual
day
in
any
country
which
can
be
named
by
that
large
name
supreme
i
can
call
to
mind
no
specialized
annual
day
in
any
country
whose
approach
fires
the
whole
land
with
a
conflagration
of
conversation
and
preparation
and
anticipation
and
jubilation
no
day
save
this
one
but
this
one
does
it
in
america
we
have
no
annual
supreme
day
no
day
whose
approach
makes
the
whole
nation
glad
we
have
the
fourth
of
july
and
christmas
and
thanksgiving
neither
of
them
can
claim
the
primacy
neither
of
them
can
arouse
an
enthusiasm
which
comes
near
to
being
universal
eight
grown
americans
out
of
ten
dread
the
coming
of
the
fourth
with
its
pandemonium
and
its
perils
and
they
rejoice
when
it
is
gone
if
still
alive
the
approach
of
christmas
brings
harassment
and
dread
to
many
excellent
people
they
have
to
buy
a
cart
load
of
presents
and
they
never
know
what
to
buy
to
hit
the
various
tastes
they
put
in
three
weeks
of
hard
and
anxious
work
and
when
christmas
morning
comes
they
are
so
dissatisfied
with
the
result
and
so
disappointed
that
they
want
to
sit
down
and
cry
then
they
give
thanks
that
christmas
comes
but
once
a
year
the
observance
of
thanksgiving
day
as
a
function
has
become
general
of
late
years
the
thankfulness
is
not
so
general
this
is
natural
two
thirds
of
the
nation
have
always
had
hard
luck
and
a
hard
time
during
the
year
and
this
has
a
calming
effect
upon
their
enthusiasm
we
have
a
supreme
day
a
sweeping
and
tremendous
and
tumultuous
day
a
day
which
commands
an
absolute
universality
of
interest
and
excitement
but
it
is
not
annual
it
comes
but
once
in
four
years
therefore
it
cannot
count
as
a
rival
of
the
melbourne
cup
in
great
britain
and
ireland
they
have
two
great
days
christmas
and
the
queen's
birthday
but
they
are
equally
popular
there
is
no
supremacy
i
think
it
must
be
conceded
that
the
position
of
the
australasian
day
is
unique
solitary
unfellowed
and
likely
to
hold
that
high
place
a
long
time
the
next
things
which
interest
us
when
we
travel
are
first
the
people
next
the
novelties
and
finally
the
history
of
the
places
and
countries
visited
novelties
are
rare
in
cities
which
represent
the
most
advanced
civilization
of
the
modern
day
when
one
is
familiar
with
such
cities
in
the
other
parts
of
the
world
he
is
in
effect
familiar
with
the
cities
of
australasia
the
outside
aspects
will
furnish
little
that
is
new
there
will
be
new
names
but
the
things
which
they
represent
will
sometimes
be
found
to
be
less
new
than
their
names
there
may
be
shades
of
difference
but
these
can
easily
be
too
fine
for
detection
by
the
incompetent
eye
of
the
passing
stranger
in
the
larrikin
he
will
not
be
able
to
discover
a
new
species
but
only
an
old
one
met
elsewhere
and
variously
called
loafer
rough
tough
bummer
or
blatherskite
according
to
his
geographical
distribution
the
larrikin
differs
by
a
shade
from
those
others
in
that
he
is
more
sociable
toward
the
stranger
than
they
more
kindly
disposed
more
hospitable
more
hearty
more
friendly
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
me
and
i
had
opportunity
to
observe
in
sydney
at
least
in
melbourne
i
had
to
drive
to
and
from
the
lecture
theater
but
in
sydney
i
was
able
to
walk
both
ways
and
did
it
every
night
on
my
way
home
at
ten
or
a
quarter
past
i
found
the
larrikin
grouped
in
considerable
force
at
several
of
the
street
corners
and
he
always
gave
me
this
pleasant
salutation
hello
mark!
here's
to
you
old
chap!
say
mark!
is
he
dead
a
reference
to
a
passage
in
some
book
of
mine
though
i
did
not
detect
at
that
time
that
that
was
its
source
and
i
didn't
detect
it
afterward
in
melbourne
when
i
came
on
the
stage
for
the
first
time
and
the
same
question
was
dropped
down
upon
me
from
the
dizzy
height
of
the
gallery
it
is
always
difficult
to
answer
a
sudden
inquiry
like
that
when
you
have
come
unprepared
and
don't
know
what
it
means
i
will
remark
here
if
it
is
not
an
indecorum
that
the
welcome
which
an
american
lecturer
gets
from
a
british
colonial
audience
is
a
thing
which
will
move
him
to
his
deepest
deeps
and
veil
his
sight
and
break
his
voice
and
from
winnipeg
to
africa
experience
will
teach
him
nothing
he
will
never
learn
to
expect
it
it
will
catch
him
as
a
surprise
each
time
the
war
cloud
hanging
black
over
england
and
america
made
no
trouble
for
me
i
was
a
prospective
prisoner
of
war
but
at
dinners
suppers
on
the
platform
and
elsewhere
there
was
never
anything
to
remind
me
of
it
this
was
hospitality
of
the
right
metal
and
would
have
been
prominently
lacking
in
some
countries
in
the
circumstances
and
speaking
of
the
war
flurry
it
seemed
to
me
to
bring
to
light
the
unexpected
in
a
detail
or
two
it
seemed
to
relegate
the
war
talk
to
the
politicians
on
both
sides
of
the
water
whereas
whenever
a
prospective
war
between
two
nations
had
been
in
the
air
theretofore
the
public
had
done
most
of
the
talking
and
the
bitterest
the
attitude
of
the
newspapers
was
new
also
i
speak
of
those
of
australasia
and
india
for
i
had
access
to
those
only
they
treated
the
subject
argumentatively
and
with
dignity
not
with
spite
and
anger
that
was
a
new
spirit
too
and
not
learned
of
the
french
and
german
press
either
before
sedan
or
since
i
heard
many
public
speeches
and
they
reflected
the
moderation
of
the
journals
the
outlook
is
that
the
english
speaking
race
will
dominate
the
earth
a
hundred
years
from
now
if
its
sections
do
not
get
to
fighting
each
other
it
would
be
a
pity
to
spoil
that
prospect
by
baffling
and
retarding
wars
when
arbitration
would
settle
their
differences
so
much
better
and
also
so
much
more
definitely
no
as
i
have
suggested
novelties
are
rare
in
the
great
capitals
of
modern
times
even
the
wool
exchange
in
melbourne
could
not
be
told
from
the
familiar
stock
exchange
of
other
countries
wool
brokers
are
just
like
stockbrokers
they
all
bounce
from
their
seats
and
put
up
their
hands
and
yell
in
unison
no
stranger
can
tell
what
and
the
president
calmly
says
sold
to
smith
&
co
threpence
farthing
next!
when
probably
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
for
how
should
he
know
in
the
museums
you
will
find
acres
of
the
most
strange
and
fascinating
things
but
all
museums
are
fascinating
and
they
do
so
tire
your
eyes
and
break
your
back
and
burn
out
your
vitalities
with
their
consuming
interest
you
always
say
you
will
never
go
again
but
you
do
go
the
palaces
of
the
rich
in
melbourne
are
much
like
the
palaces
of
the
rich
in
america
and
the
life
in
them
is
the
same
but
there
the
resemblance
ends
the
grounds
surrounding
the
american
palace
are
not
often
large
and
not
often
beautiful
but
in
the
melbourne
case
the
grounds
are
often
ducally
spacious
and
the
climate
and
the
gardeners
together
make
them
as
beautiful
as
a
dream
it
is
said
that
some
of
the
country
seats
have
grounds
domains
about
them
which
rival
in
charm
and
magnitude
those
which
surround
the
country
mansion
of
an
english
lord
but
i
was
not
out
in
the
country
i
had
my
hands
full
in
town
and
what
was
the
origin
of
this
majestic
city
and
its
efflorescence
of
palatial
town
houses
and
country
seats
its
first
brick
was
laid
and
its
first
house
built
by
a
passing
convict
australian
history
is
almost
always
picturesque
indeed
it
is
so
curious
and
strange
that
it
is
itself
the
chiefest
novelty
the
country
has
to
offer
and
so
it
pushes
the
other
novelties
into
second
and
third
place
it
does
not
read
like
history
but
like
the
most
beautiful
lies
and
all
of
a
fresh
new
sort
no
mouldy
old
stale
ones
it
is
full
of
surprises
and
adventures
and
incongruities
and
contradictions
and
incredibilities
but
they
are
all
true
they
all
happened

pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
when
we
consider
the
immensity
of
the
british
empire
in
territory
population
and
trade
it
requires
a
stern
exercise
of
faith
to
believe
in
the
figures
which
represent
australasia's
contribution
to
the
empire's
commercial
grandeur
as
compared
with
the
landed
estate
of
the
british
empire
the
landed
estate
dominated
by
any
other
power
except
one
russia
is
not
very
impressive
for
size
my
authorities
make
the
british
empire
not
much
short
of
a
fourth
larger
than
the
russian
empire
roughly
proportioned
if
you
will
allow
your
entire
hand
to
represent
the
british
empire
you
may
then
cut
off
the
fingers
a
trifle
above
the
middle
joint
of
the
middle
finger
and
what
is
left
of
the
hand
will
represent
russia
the
populations
ruled
by
great
britain
and
china
are
about
the
same
400
000
000
each
no
other
power
approaches
these
figures
even
russia
is
left
far
behind
the
population
of
australasia
4
000
000
sinks
into
nothingness
and
is
lost
from
sight
in
that
british
ocean
of
400
000
000
yet
the
statistics
indicate
that
it
rises
again
and
shows
up
very
conspicuously
when
its
share
of
the
empire's
commerce
is
the
matter
under
consideration
the
value
of
england's
annual
exports
and
imports
is
stated
at
three
billions
of
dollars
[new
south
wales
blue
book
]
and
it
is
claimed
that
more
than
one
tenth
of
this
great
aggregate
is
represented
by
australasia's
exports
to
england
and
imports
from
england
in
addition
to
this
australasia
does
a
trade
with
countries
other
than
england
amounting
to
a
hundred
million
dollars
a
year
and
a
domestic
intercolonial
trade
amounting
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
millions
in
round
numbers
the
4
000
000
buy
and
sell
about
$600
000
000
worth
of
goods
a
year
it
is
claimed
that
about
half
of
this
represents
commodities
of
australasian
production
the
products
exported
annually
by
india
are
worth
a
trifle
over
$500
000
000
now
here
are
some
faith
straining
figures
indian

$500
000
000
australasian
production
4
000

$300
000
000
that
is
to
say
the
product
of
the
individual
indian
annually
for
export
some
whither
is
worth
$1
15
that
of
the
individual
australasian
for
export
some
whither
$75!
or
to
put
it
in
another
way
the
indian
family
of
man
and
wife
and
three
children
sends
away
an
annual
result
worth
$8
75
while
the
australasian
family
sends
away
$375
worth
there
are
trustworthy
statistics
furnished
by
sir
richard
temple
and
others
which
show
that
the
individual
indian's
whole
annual
product
both
for
export
and
home
use
is
worth
in
gold
only
$7
50
or
$37
50
for
the
family
aggregate
ciphered
out
on
a
like
ratio
of
multiplication
the
australasian
family's
aggregate
production
would
be
nearly
$1
600
truly
nothing
is
so
astonishing
as
figures
if
they
once
get
started
we
left
melbourne
by
rail
for
adelaide
the
capital
of
the
vast
province
of
south
australia
a
seventeen
hour
excursion
on
the
train
we
found
several
sydney
friends
among
them
a
judge
who
was
going
out
on
circuit
and
was
going
to
hold
court
at
broken
hill
where
the
celebrated
silver
mine
is
it
seemed
a
curious
road
to
take
to
get
to
that
region
broken
hill
is
close
to
the
western
border
of
new
south
wales
and
sydney
is
on
the
eastern
border
a
fairly
straight
line
700
miles
long
drawn
westward
from
sydney
would
strike
broken
hill
just
as
a
somewhat
shorter
one
drawn
west
from
boston
would
strike
buffalo
the
way
the
judge
was
traveling
would
carry
him
over
2
000
miles
by
rail
he
said
southwest
from
sydney
down
to
melbourne
then
northward
up
to
adelaide
then
a
cant
back
northeastward
and
over
the
border
into
new
south
wales
once
more
to
broken
hill
it
was
like
going
from
boston
southwest
to
richmond
virginia
then
northwest
up
to
erie
pennsylvania
then
a
cant
back
northeast
and
over
the
border
to
buffalo
new
york
but
the
explanation
was
simple
years
ago
the
fabulously
rich
silver
discovery
at
broken
hill
burst
suddenly
upon
an
unexpectant
world
its
stocks
started
at
shillings
and
went
by
leaps
and
bounds
to
the
most
fanciful
figures
it
was
one
of
those
cases
where
the
cook
puts
a
month's
wages
into
shares
and
comes
next
mouth
and
buys
your
house
at
your
own
price
and
moves
into
it
herself
where
the
coachman
takes
a
few
shares
and
next
month
sets
up
a
bank
and
where
the
common
sailor
invests
the
price
of
a
spree
and
next
month
buys
out
the
steamship
company
and
goes
into
business
on
his
own
hook
in
a
word
it
was
one
of
those
excitements
which
bring
multitudes
of
people
to
a
common
center
with
a
rush
and
whose
needs
must
be
supplied
and
at
once
adelaide
was
close
by
sydney
was
far
away
adelaide
threw
a
short
railway
across
the
border
before
sydney
had
time
to
arrange
for
a
long
one
it
was
not
worth
while
for
sydney
to
arrange
at
all
the
whole
vast
trade
profit
of
broken
hill
fell
into
adelaide's
hands
irrevocably
new
south
wales
furnishes
for
broken
hill
and
sends
her
judges
2
000
miles
mainly
through
alien
countries
to
administer
it
but
adelaide
takes
the
dividends
and
makes
no
moan
we
started
at
4
20
in
the
afternoon
and
moved
across
level
until
night
in
the
morning
we
had
a
stretch
of
scrub
country
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
so
useful
to
the
australian
novelist
in
the
scrub
the
hostile
aboriginal
lurks
and
flits
mysteriously
about
slipping
out
from
time
to
time
to
surprise
and
slaughter
the
settler
then
slipping
back
again
and
leaving
no
track
that
the
white
man
can
follow
in
the
scrub
the
novelist's
heroine
gets
lost
search
fails
of
result
she
wanders
here
and
there
and
finally
sinks
down
exhausted
and
unconscious
and
the
searchers
pass
within
a
yard
or
two
of
her
not
suspecting
that
she
is
near
and
by
and
by
some
rambler
finds
her
bones
and
the
pathetic
diary
which
she
had
scribbled
with
her
failing
hand
and
left
behind
nobody
can
find
a
lost
heroine
in
the
scrub
but
the
aboriginal
tracker
and
he
will
not
lend
himself
to
the
scheme
if
it
will
interfere
with
the
novelist's
plot
the
scrub
stretches
miles
and
miles
in
all
directions
and
looks
like
a
level
roof
of
bush
tops
without
a
break
or
a
crack
in
it
as
seamless
as
a
blanket
to
all
appearance
one
might
as
well
walk
under
water
and
hope
to
guess
out
a
route
and
stick
to
it
i
should
think
yet
it
is
claimed
that
the
aboriginal
tracker
was
able
to
hunt
out
people
lost
in
the
scrub
also
in
the
bush
also
in
the
desert
and
even
follow
them
over
patches
of
bare
rocks
and
over
alluvial
ground
which
had
to
all
appearance
been
washed
clear
of
footprints
from
reading
australian
books
and
talking
with
the
people
i
became
convinced
that
the
aboriginal
tracker's
performances
evince
a
craft
a
penetration
a
luminous
sagacity
and
a
minuteness
and
accuracy
of
observation
in
the
matter
of
detective
work
not
found
in
nearly
so
remarkable
a
degree
in
any
other
people
white
or
colored
in
an
official
account
of
the
blacks
of
australia
published
by
the
government
of
victoria
one
reads
that
the
aboriginal
not
only
notices
the
faint
marks
left
on
the
bark
of
a
tree
by
the
claws
of
a
climbing
opossum
but
knows
in
some
way
or
other
whether
the
marks
were
made
to
day
or
yesterday
and
there
is
the
case
on
records
where
a
a
settler
makes
a
bet
with
b
that
b
may
lose
a
cow
as
effectually
as
he
can
and
a
will
produce
an
aboriginal
who
will
find
her
b
selects
a
cow
and
lets
the
tracker
see
the
cow's
footprint
then
be
put
under
guard
b
then
drives
the
cow
a
few
miles
over
a
course
which
drifts
in
all
directions
and
frequently
doubles
back
upon
itself
and
he
selects
difficult
ground
all
the
time
and
once
or
twice
even
drives
the
cow
through
herds
of
other
cows
and
mingles
her
tracks
in
the
wide
confusion
of
theirs
he
finally
brings
his
cow
home
the
aboriginal
is
set
at
liberty
and
at
once
moves
around
in
a
great
circle
examining
all
cow
tracks
until
he
finds
the
one
he
is
after
then
sets
off
and
follows
it
throughout
its
erratic
course
and
ultimately
tracks
it
to
the
stable
where
b
has
hidden
the
cow
now
wherein
does
one
cow
track
differ
from
another
there
must
be
a
difference
or
the
tracker
could
not
have
performed
the
feat
a
difference

pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
the
train
was
now
exploring
a
beautiful
hill
country
and
went
twisting
in
and
out
through
lovely
little
green
valleys
there
were
several
varieties
of
gum
trees
among
them
many
giants
some
of
them
were
bodied
and
barked
like
the
sycamore
some
were
of
fantastic
aspect
and
reminded
one
of
the
quaint
apple
trees
in
japanese
pictures
and
there
was
one
peculiarly
beautiful
tree
whose
name
and
breed
i
did
not
know
the
foliage
seemed
to
consist
of
big
bunches
of
pine
spines
the
lower
half
of
each
bunch
a
rich
brown
or
old
gold
color
the
upper
half
a
most
vivid
and
strenuous
and
shouting
green
the
effect
was
altogether
bewitching
the
tree
was
apparently
rare
i
should
say
that
the
first
and
last
samples
of
it
seen
by
us
were
not
more
than
half
an
hour
apart
there
was
another
tree
of
striking
aspect
a
kind
of
pine
we
were
told
its
foliage
was
as
fine
as
hair
apparently
and
its
mass
sphered
itself
above
the
naked
straight
stem
like
an
explosion
of
misty
smoke
it
was
not
a
sociable
sort
it
did
not
gather
in
groups
or
couples
but
each
individual
stood
far
away
from
its
nearest
neighbor
it
scattered
itself
in
this
spacious
and
exclusive
fashion
about
the
slopes
of
swelling
grassy
great
knolls
and
stood
in
the
full
flood
of
the
wonderful
sunshine
and
as
far
as
you
could
see
the
tree
itself
you
could
also
see
the
ink
black
blot
of
its
shadow
on
the
shining
green
carpet
at
its
feet
on
some
part
of
this
railway
journey
we
saw
gorse
and
broom
importations
from
england
and
a
gentleman
who
came
into
our
compartment
on
a
visit
tried
to
tell
me
which
was
which
but
as
he
didn't
know
he
had
difficulty
he
said
he
was
ashamed
of
his
ignorance
but
that
he
had
never
been
confronted
with
the
question
before
during
the
fifty
years
and
more
that
he
had
spent
in
australia
and
so
he
had
never
happened
to
get
interested
in
the
matter
but
there
was
no
need
to
be
ashamed
the
most
of
us
have
his
defect
we
take
a
natural
interest
in
novelties
but
it
is
against
nature
to
take
an
interest
in
familiar
things
the
gorse
and
the
broom
were
a
fine
accent
in
the
landscape
here
and
there
they
burst
out
in
sudden
conflagrations
of
vivid
yellow
against
a
background
of
sober
or
sombre
color
with
a
so
startling
effect
as
to
make
a
body
catch
his
breath
with
the
happy
surprise
of
it
and
then
there
was
the
wattle
a
native
bush
or
tree
an
inspiring
cloud
of
sumptuous
yellow
bloom
it
is
a
favorite
with
the
australians
and
has
a
fine
fragrance
a
quality
usually
wanting
in
australian
blossoms
the
gentleman
who
enriched
me
with
the
poverty
of
his
formation
about
the
gorse
and
the
broom
told
me
that
he
came
out
from
england
a
youth
of
twenty
and
entered
the
province
of
south
australia
with
thirty
six
shillings
in
his
pocket
an
adventurer
without
trade
profession
or
friends
but
with
a
clearly
defined
purpose
in
his
head
he
would
stay
until
he
was
worth
l200
then
go
back
home
he
would
allow
himself
five
years
for
the
accumulation
of
this
fortune
that
was
more
than
fifty
years
ago
said
he
and
here
i
am
yet
as
he
went
out
at
the
door
he
met
a
friend
and
turned
and
introduced
him
to
me
and
the
friend
and
i
had
a
talk
and
a
smoke
i
spoke
of
the
previous
conversation
and
said
there
something
very
pathetic
about
this
half
century
of
exile
and
that
i
wished
the
l200
scheme
had
succeeded
with
him
oh
it
did
it's
not
so
sad
a
case
he
is
modest
and
he
left
out
some
of
the
particulars
the
lad
reached
south
australia
just
in
time
to
help
discover
the
burra
burra
copper
mines
they
turned
out
l700
000
in
the
first
three
years
up
to
now
they
have
yielded
l120
000
000
he
has
had
his
share
before
that
boy
had
been
in
the
country
two
years
he
could
have
gone
home
and
bought
a
village
he
could
go
now
and
buy
a
city
i
think
no
there
is
nothing
very
pathetic
about
his
case
he
and
his
copper
arrived
at
just
a
handy
time
to
save
south
australia
it
had
got
mashed
pretty
flat
under
the
collapse
of
a
land
boom
a
while
before
there
it

australia's

in

south
australia
hadn't
a
white
man
in
it
in
1836
the
british
parliament
erected
it
still
a
solitude
into
a
province
and
gave
it
a
governor
and
other
governmental
machinery
speculators
took
hold
now
and
inaugurated
a
vast

scheme
and
invited
immigration
encouraging
it
with
lurid
promises
of
sudden

it
was
well
worked
in
london
and
bishops
statesmen
and
all
ports
of
people
made
a
rush
for
the

shares
immigrants
soon
began
to
pour
into
the

of
adelaide

the
crowds
continued
to
come
prices
of

rose
high
then
higher
and
still
higher
everybody
was
prosperous
and
happy
the
boom
swelled
into
gigantic
proportions
a

sprang
up
in

in

made

played
on

london
swells
in

and

were
abundant
and
this
fine
society
drank
champagne
and
in
other
ways
conducted
itself
in
this
capital
of
humble
sheds
as
it
had
been
accustomed
to
do
in
the
aristocratic
quarters
of
the
metropolis
of

the
provincial
government
put
up
expensive
buildings
for
its
own
use
and
a
palace
with
gardens
for
the
use
of
its

the
governor
had
a
guard
and
maintained

were

came

went
over
the
border
and
took
it
giving
thanks
among
our
passengers
was
an
american
with
a
unique
vocation
unique
is
a
strong
word
but
i
use
it
justifiably
if
i
did
not
misconceive
what
the
american
told
me
for
i
understood
him
to
say
that
in
the
world
there
was
not
another
man
engaged
in
the
business
which
he
was
following
he
was
buying
the
kangaroo
skin
crop
buying
all
of
it
both
the
australian
crop
and
the
tasmanian
and
buying
it
for
an
american
house
in
new
york
the
prices
were
not
high
as
there
was
no
competition
but
the
year's
aggregate
of
skins
would
cost
him
l30
000
i
had
had
the
idea
that
the
kangaroo
was
about
extinct
in
tasmania
and
well
thinned
out
on
the
continent
in
america
the
skins
are
tanned
and
made
into
shoes
after
the
tanning
the
leather
takes
a
new
name
which
i
have
forgotten
i
only
remember
that
the
new
name
does
not
indicate
that
the
kangaroo
furnishes
the
leather
there
was
a
german
competition
for
a
while
some
years
ago
but
that
has
ceased
the
germans
failed
to
arrive
at
the
secret
of
tanning
the
skins
successfully
and
they
withdrew
from
the
business
now
then
i
suppose
that
i
have
seen
a
man
whose
occupation
is
really
entitled
to
bear
that
high
epithet
unique
and
i
suppose
that
there
is
not
another
occupation
in
the
world
that
is
restricted
to
the
hands
of
a
sole
person
i
can
think
of
no
instance
of
it
there
is
more
than
one
pope
there
is
more
than
one
emperor
there
is
even
more
than
one
living
god
walking
upon
the
earth
and
worshiped
in
all
sincerity
by
large
populations
of
men
i
have
seen
and
talked
with
two
of
these
beings
myself
in
india
and
i
have
the
autograph
of
one
of
them
it
can
come
good
by
and
by
i
reckon
if
i
attach
it
to
a
permit
approaching
adelaide
we
dismounted
from
the
train
as
the
french
say
and
were
driven
in
an
open
carriage
over
the
hills
and
along
their
slopes
to
the
city
it
was
an
excursion
of
an
hour
or
two
and
the
charm
of
it
could
not
be
overstated
i
think
the
road
wound
around
gaps
and
gorges
and
offered
all
varieties
of
scenery
and
prospect
mountains
crags
country
homes
gardens
forests
color
color
color
everywhere
and
the
air
fine
and
fresh
the
skies
blue
and
not
a
shred
of
cloud
to
mar
the
downpour
of
the
brilliant
sunshine
and
finally
the
mountain
gateway
opened
and
the
immense
plain
lay
spread
out
below
and
stretching
away
into
dim
distances
on
every
hand
soft
and
delicate
and
dainty
and
beautiful
on
its
near
edge
reposed
the
city
we
descended
and
entered
there
was
nothing
to
remind
one
of
the
humble
capital
of
buts
and
sheds
of
the
long
vanished
day
of
the
land
boom
no
this
was
a
modern
city
with
wide
streets
compactly
built
with
fine
homes
everywhere
embowered
in
foliage
and
flowers
and
with
imposing
masses
of
public
buildings
nobly
grouped
and
architecturally
beautiful
there
was
prosperity
in
the
air
for
another

to
show

neighboring

west
called
western

everything

when
the

came
the

was
nearly
as
poor
in

of

as

appear

i
saw
the
only
laughing
jackass
that
ever
showed
any
disposition
to
be
courteous
to
me
this
one
opened
his
head
wide
and
laughed
like
a
demon
or
like
a
maniac
who
was
consumed
with
humorous
scorn
over
a
cheap
and
degraded
pun
it
was
a
very
human
laugh
if
he
had
been
out
of
sight
i
could
have
believed
that
the
laughter
came
from
a
man
it
is
an
odd
looking
bird
with
a
head
and
beak
that
are
much
too
large
for
its
body
in
time
man
will
exterminate
the
rest
of
the
wild
creatures
of
australia
but
this
one
will
probably
survive
for
man
is
his
friend
and
lets
him
alone
man
always
has
a
good
reason
for
his
charities
towards
wild
things
human
or
animal
when
he
has
any
in
this
case
the
bird
is
spared
because
he
kills
snakes
if
l
j
he
will
not
kill
all
of
them
in
that
garden
i
also
saw
the
wild
australian
dog
the
dingo
he
was
a
beautiful
creature
shapely
graceful
a
little
wolfish
in
some
of
his
aspects
but
with
a
most
friendly
eye
and
sociable
disposition
the
dingo
is
not
an
importation
he
was
present
in
great
force
when
the
whites
first
came
to
the
continent
it
may
be
that
he
is
the
oldest
dog
in
the
universe
his
origin
his
descent
the
place
where
his
ancestors
first
appeared
are
as
unknown
and
as
untraceable
as
are
the
camel's
he
is
the
most
precious
dog
in
the
world
for
he
does
not
bark
but
in
an
evil
hour
he
got
to
raiding
the
sheep
runs
to
appease
his
hunger
and
that
sealed
his
doom
he
is
hunted
now
just
as
if
he
were
a
wolf
he
has
been
sentenced
to
extermination
and
the
sentence
will
be
carried
out

is
all
right

not
objectionable

there
were

no

to

thence

there
was

i
was
in
adelaide
again
some
months
later
and
saw
the
multitudes
gather
in
the
neighboring
city
of
glenelg
to
commemorate
the
reading
of
the
proclamation
in
1836
which
founded
the
province
if
i
have
at
any
time
called
it
a
colony
i
withdraw
the
discourtesy
it
is
not
a
colony
it
is
a
province
and
officially
so
moreover
it
is
the
only
one
so
named
in
australasia
there
was
great
enthusiasm
it
was
the
province's
national
holiday
its
fourth
of
july
so
to
speak
it
is
the
pre
eminent
holiday
and
that
is
saying
much
in
a
country
where
they
seem
to
have
a
most
un
english
mania
for
holidays
mainly
they
are
workingmen's
holidays
for
in
south
australia
the
workingman
is
sovereign
his
vote
is
the
desire
of
the
politician
indeed
it
is
the
very
breath
of
the
politician's
being
the
parliament
exists
to
deliver
the
will
of
the
workingman
and
the
government
exists
to
execute
it
the
workingman
is
a
great
power
everywhere
in
australia
but
south
australia
is
his
paradise
he
has
had
a
hard
time
in
this
world
and
has
earned
a
paradise
i
am
glad
he
has
found
it
the
holidays
there
are
frequent
enough
to
be
bewildering
to
the
stranger
i
tried
to
get
the
hang
of
the
system
but
was
not
able
to
do
it
you
have
seen
that
the
province
is
tolerant
religious
wise
it
is
so
politically
also
one
of
the
speakers
at
the
commemoration
banquet
the
minister
of
public
works
was
an
american
born
and
reared
in
new
england
there
is
nothing
narrow
about
the
province
politically
or
in
any
other
way
that
i
know
of
sixty
four
religions
and
a
yankee
cabinet
minister
no
amount
of
horse
racing
can
damn
this
community
the
mean
temperature
of
the
province
is
62
deg
the
death
rate
is
13
in
the
1
000
about
half
what
it
is
in
the
city
of
new
york
i
should
think
and
new
york
is
a
healthy
city
thirteen
is
the
death
rate
for
the
average
citizen
of
the
province
but
there
seems
to
be
no
death
rate
for
the
old
people
there
were
people
at
the
commemoration
banquet
who
could
remember
cromwell
there
were
six
of
them
these
old
settlers
had
all
been
present
at
the
original
reading
of
the
proclamation
in
1536
they
showed
signs
of
the
blightings
and
blastings
of
time
in
their
outward
aspect
but
they
were
young
within
young
and
cheerful
and
ready
to
talk
ready
to
talk
and
talk
all
you
wanted
in
their
turn
and
out
of
it
they
were
down
for
six
speeches
and
they
made
42
the
governor
and
the
cabinet
and
the
mayor
were
down
for
42
speeches
and
they
made
6
they
have
splendid
grit
the
old
settlers
splendid
staying
power
but
they
do
not
hear
well
and
when
they
see
the
mayor
going
through
motions
which
they
recognize
as
the
introducing
of
a
speaker
they
think
they
are
the
one
and
they
all
get
up
together
and
begin
to
respond
in
the
most
animated
way
and
the
more
the
mayor
gesticulates
and
shouts
sit
down!
sit
down!
the
more
they
take
it
for
applause
and
the
more
excited
and
reminiscent
and
enthusiastic
they
get
and
next
when
they
see
the
whole
house
laughing
and
crying
three
of
them
think
it
is
about
the
bitter
old
time
hardships
they
are
describing
and
the
other
three
think
the
laughter
is
caused
by
the
jokes
they
have
been
uncorking
jokes
of
the
vintage
of
1836
and
then
the
way
they
do
go
on!
and
finally
when
ushers
come
and
plead
and
beg
and
gently
and
reverently
crowd
them
down
into
their
seats
they
say
oh
i'm
not
tired
i
could
bang
along
a
week!
and
they
sit
there
looking
simple
and
childlike
and
gentle
and
proud
of
their
oratory
and
wholly
unconscious
of
what
is
going
on
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
so
one
of
the
great
dignitaries
gets
a
chance
and
begins
his
carefully
prepared
speech
impressively
and
with
solemnity
when
we
now
great
and
prosperous
and
powerful
bow
our
heads
in
reverent
wonder
in
the
contemplation
of
those
sublimities
of
energy
of
wisdom
of
forethought
of
up
come
the
immortal
six
again
in
a
body
with
a
joyous
hey
i've
thought
of
another
one!
and
at
it
they
go
with
might
and
main
hearing
not
a
whisper
of
the
pandemonium
that
salutes
them
but
taking
all
the
visible
violences
for
applause
as
before
and
hammering
joyously
away
till
the
imploring
ushers
pray
them
into
their
seats
again
and
a
pity
too
for
those
lovely
old
boys
did
so
enjoy
living
their
heroic
youth
over
in
these
days
of
their
honored
antiquity
and
certainly
the
things
they
had
to
tell
were
usually
worth
the
telling
and
the
hearing
it
was
a
stirring
spectacle
stirring
in
more
ways
than
one
for
it
was
amazingly
funny
and
at
the
same
time
deeply
pathetic
for
they
had
seen
so
much
these
time
worn
veterans
end
had
suffered
so
much
and
had
built
so
strongly
and
well
and
laid
the
foundations
of
their
commonwealth
so
deep
in
liberty
and
tolerance
and
had
lived
to
see
the
structure
rise
to
such
state
and
dignity
and
hear
themselves
so
praised
for
honorable
work
one
of
these
old
gentlemen
told
me
some
things
of
interest
afterward
things
about
the
aboriginals
mainly
he
thought
them
intelligent
remarkably
so
in
some
directions
and
he
said
that
along
with
their
unpleasant
qualities
they
had
some
exceedingly
good
ones
and
he
considered
it
a
great
pity
that
the
race
had
died
out
he
instanced
their
invention
of
the
boomerang
and
the
weet
weet
as
evidences
of
their
brightness
and
as
another
evidence
of
it
he
said
he
had
never
seen
a
white
man
who
had
cleverness
enough
to
learn
to
do
the
miracles
with
those
two
toys
that
the
aboriginals
achieved
he
said
that
even
the
smartest
whites
had
been
obliged
to
confess
that
they
could
not
learn
the
trick
of
the
boomerang
in
perfection
that
it
had
possibilities
which
they
could
not
master
the
white
man
could
not
control
its
motions
could
not
make
it
obey
him
but
the
aboriginal
could
he
told
me
some
wonderful
things
some
almost
incredible
things
which
he
had
seen
the
blacks
do
with
the
boomerang
and
the
weet
weet
they
have
been
confirmed
to
me
since
by
other
early
settlers
and
by
trustworthy
books
it
is
contended
and
may
be
said
to
be
conceded
that
the
boomerang
was
known
to
certain
savage
tribes
in
europe
in
roman
times
in
support
of
this
virgil
and
two
other
roman
poets
are
quoted
it
is
also
contended
that
it
was
known
to
the
ancient
egyptians
one
of
two
things
either
some
one
with
is
then
apparent
a
boomerang
arrived
in
australia
in
the
days
of
antiquity
before
european
knowledge
of
the
thing
had
been
lost
or
the
australian
aboriginal
reinvented
it
it
will
take
some
time
to
find
out
which
of
these
two
propositions
is
the
fact
but
there
is
no
hurry
chapter
xx
it
is
by
the
goodness
of
god
that
in
our
country
we
have
those
three
unspeakably
precious
things
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
conscience
and
the
prudence
never
to
practice
either
of
them

i
had
not
seen
him
since
nauheim
germany
several
years
ago
the
time
that
the
cholera
broke
out
at
hamburg
we
talked
of
the
people
we
had
known
there
or
had
casually
met
and
g
said
do
you
remember

introducing
you
to

the

that
was
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
and
he
were
in
a
carriage
just
starting
belated
for
the
train
i
remember
it
i
remember
it
too
because
of
a
thing
which
happened
then
which
i
was
not
looking
for
he
had
told
me
a
while
before
about
a
remarkable
and
interesting
californian
whom
he
had
met
and
who
was
a
friend
of
yours
and
said
that
if
he
should
ever
meet
you
he
would
ask
you
for
some
particulars
about
that
californian
the
subject
was
not
mentioned
that
day
at
nauheim
for
we
were
hurrying
away
and
there
was
no
time
but
the
thing
that
surprised
me
was
this
when
i
induced

said

the
i
again'
was
the
surprise
he
is
a
little
hard
of
hearing
and
didn't
catch
that
word
and
i
thought
you
hadn't
intended
that
he
should
as
we
drove
off
i
had
only
time
to
say
'why
what
do
you
know
about
him
'
and
i
understood
you
to
say
'oh
nothing
except
that
he
is
the
quickest
judge
of
'
then
we
were
gone
and
i
didn't
get
the
rest
i
wondered
what
it
was
that
he
was
such
a
quick
judge
of
i
have
thought
of
it
many
times
since
and
still
wondered
what
it
could
be
he
and
i
talked
it
over
but
could
not
guess
it
out
he
thought
it
must
be
fox
hounds
or
horses
for
he
is
a
good
judge
of
those
no
one
is
a
better
but
you
couldn't
know
that
because
you
didn't
know
him
you
had
mistaken
him
for
some
one
else
it
must
be
that
he
said
because
he
knew
you
had
never
met
him
before
and
of
course
you
hadn't
had
you
yes
i
had
is
that
so
where
at
a
fox
hunt
in
england
how
curious
that
is
why
he
hadn't
the
least
recollection
of
it
had
you
any
conversation
with
him
some
yes
well
it
left
not
the
least
impression
upon
him
what
did
you
talk
about
about
the
fox
i
think
that
was
all
why
that
would
interest
him
that
ought
to
have
left
an
impression
what
did
he
talk
about
the
fox
it's
very
curious
i
don't
understand
it
did
what
he
said
leave
an
impression
upon
you
yes
it
showed
me
that
he
was
a
quick
judge
of
however
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
then
you
will
understand
it
was
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
1873
or
'74
i
had
an
american
friend
in
london
named
f
who
was
fond
of
hunting
and
his
friends
the
blanks
invited
him
and
me
to
come
out
to
a
hunt
and
be
their
guests
at
their
country
place
in
the
morning
the
mounts
were
provided
but
when
i
saw
the
horses
i
changed
my
mind
and
asked
permission
to
walk
i
had
never
seen
an
english
hunter
before
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
hunt
a
fox
safer
on
the
ground
i
had
always
been
diffident
about
horses
anyway
even
those
of
the
common
altitudes
and
i
did
not
feel
competent
to
hunt
on
a
horse
that
went
on
stilts
so
then
mrs
blank
came
to
my
help
and
said
i
could
go
with
her
in
the
dog
cart
and
we
would
drive
to
a
place
she
knew
of
and
there
we
should
have
a
good
glimpse
of
the
hunt
as
it
went
by
when
we
got
to
that
place
i
got
out
and
went
and
leaned
my
elbows
on
a
low
stone
wall
which
enclosed
a
turfy
and
beautiful
great
field
with
heavy
wood
on
all
its
sides
except
ours
mrs
blank
sat
in
the
dog
cart
fifty
yards
away
which
was
as
near
as
she
could
get
with
the
vehicle
i
was
full
of
interest
for
i
had
never
seen
a
fox
hunt
i
waited
dreaming
and
imagining
in
the
deep
stillness
and
impressive
tranquility
which
reigned
in
that
retired
spot
presently
from
away
off
in
the
forest
on
the
left
a
mellow
bugle
note
came
floating
then
all
of
a
sudden
a
multitude
of
dogs
burst
out
of
that
forest
and
went
tearing
by
and
disappeared
in
the
forest
on
the
right
there
was
a
pause
and
then
a
cloud
of
horsemen
in
black
caps
and
crimson
coats
plunged
out
of
the
left
hand
forest
and
went
flaming
across
the
field
like
a
prairie
fire
a
stirring
sight
to
see
there
was
one
man
ahead
of
the
rest
and
he
came
spurring
straight
at
me
he
was
fiercely
excited
it
was
fine
to
see
him
ride
he
was
a
master
horseman
he
came
like
a
storm
till
he
was
within
seven
feet
of
me
where
i
was
leaning
on
the
wall
then
he
stood
his
horse
straight
up
in
the
air
on
his
hind
toe
nails
and
shouted
like
a
demon
'which
way'd
the
fox
go
'
i
didn't
much
like
the
tone
but
i
did
not
let
on
for
he
was
excited
you
know
but
i
was
calm
so
i
said
softly
and
without
acrimony
'which
fox
'
it
seemed
to
anger
him
i
don't
know
why
and
he
thundered
out
'which
fox
why
the
fox
which
way
did
the
fox
go
'
i
said
with
great
gentleness
even
argumentatively
'if
you
could
be
a
little
more
definite
a
little
less
vague
because
i
am
a
stranger
and
there
are
many
foxes
as
you
will
know
even
better
than
i
and
unless
i
know
which
one
it
is
that
you
desire
to
identify
and
'
'you're
certainly
the
damdest
idiot
that
has
escaped
in
a
thousand
years!'
and
he
snatched
his
great
horse
around
as
easily
as
i
would
snatch
a
cat
and
was
away
like
a
hurricane
a
very
excitable
man
i
went
back
to
mrs
blank
and
she
was
excited
too
oh
all
alive
she
said
'he
spoke
to
you!
didn't
he
'
'yes
it
is
what
happened
'
'i
knew
it!
i
couldn't
hear
what
he
said
but
i
knew

just
in

to

being
shut
in
by
the
quarantine
bars
on
the
frontiers
and
so
did
we
for
we
left
the
next
day
but
g
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
getting
by
the
italian
custom
house
and
we
should
have
fared
likewise
but
for
the
thoughtfulness
of
our
consul
general
in
frankfort
he
introduced
me
to
the
italian
consul
general
and
i
brought
away
from
that
consulate
a
letter
which
made
our
way
smooth
it
was
a
dozen
lines
merely
commending
me
in
a
general
way
to
the
courtesies
of
servants
in
his
italian
majesty's
service
but
it
was
more
powerful
than
it
looked
in
addition
to
a
raft
of
ordinary
baggage
we
had
six
or
eight
trunks
which
were
filled
exclusively
with
dutiable
stuff
household
goods
purchased
in
frankfort
for
use
in
florence
where
we
had
taken
a
house
i
was
going
to
ship
these
through
by
express
but
at
the
last
moment
an
order
went
throughout
germany
forbidding
the
moving
of
any
parcels
by
train
unless
the
owner
went
with
them
this
was
a
bad
outlook
we
must
take
these
things
along
and
the
delay
sure
to
be
caused
by
the
examination
of
them
in
the
custom
house
might
lose
us
our
train
i
imagined
all
sorts
of
terrors
and
enlarged
them
steadily
as
we
approached
the
italian
frontier
we
were
six
in
number
clogged
with
all
that
baggage
and
i
was
courier
for
the
party
the
most
incapable
one
they
ever
employed
we
arrived
and
pressed
with
the
crowd
into
the
immense
custom
house
and
the
usual
worries
began
everybody
crowding
to
the
counter
and
begging
to
have
his
baggage
examined
first
and
all
hands
clattering
and
chattering
at
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
do
nothing
it
would
be
better
to
give
it
all
up
and
go
away
and
leave
the
baggage
i
couldn't
speak
the
language
i
should
never
accomplish
anything
just
then
a
tall
handsome
man
in
a
fine
uniform
was
passing
by
and
i
knew
he
must
be
the
station
master
and
that
reminded
me
of
my
letter
i
ran
to
him
and
put
it
into
his
hands
he
took
it
out
of
the
envelope
and
the
moment
his
eye
caught
the
royal
coat
of
arms
printed
at
its
top
he
took
off
his
cap
and
made
a
beautiful
bow
to
me
and
said
in
english
which
is
your
baggage
please
show
it
to
me
i
showed
him
the
mountain
nobody
was
disturbing
it
nobody
was
interested
in
it
all
the
family's
attempts
to
get
attention
to
it
had
failed
except
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
trunks
containing
the
dutiable
goods
it
was
just
being
opened
my
officer
said
there

that
alone!

he
plowed
through
the
waiting
crowd
i
following
to
the
counter
and
he
gave
orders
again
in
his
emphatic
military
way
chalk
these
chalk
all
of
them
then
he
took
off
his
cap
and
made
that
beautiful
bow
again
and
went
his
way
by
this
time
these
attentions
had
attracted
the
wonder
of
that
acre
of
passengers
and
the
whisper
had
gone
around
that
the
royal
family
were
present
getting
their
baggage
chalked
and
as
we
passed
down
in
review
on
our
way
to
the
door
i
was
conscious
of
a
pervading
atmosphere
of
envy
which
gave
me
deep
satisfaction
but
soon
there
was
an
accident
my
overcoat
pockets
were
stuffed
with
german
cigars
and
linen
packages
of
american
smoking
tobacco
and
a
porter
was
following
us
around
with
this
overcoat
on
his
arm
and
gradually
getting
it
upside
down
just
as
i
in
the
rear
of
my
family
moved
by
the
sentinels
at
the
door
about
three
hatfuls
of
the
tobacco
tumbled
out
on
the
floor
one
of
the
soldiers
pounced
upon
it
gathered
it
up
in
his
arms
pointed
back
whence
i
had
come
and
marched
me
ahead
of
him
past
that
long
wall
of
passengers
again
he
chattering
and
exulting
like
a
devil
they
smiling
in
peaceful
joy
and
i
trying
to
look
as
if
my
pride
was
not
hurt
and
as
if
i
did
not
mind
being
brought
to
shame
before
these
pleased
people
who
had
so
lately
envied
me
but
at
heart
i
was
cruelly
humbled
when
i
had
been
marched
two
thirds
of
the
long
distance
and
the
misery
of
it
was
at
the
worst
the
stately
station
master
stepped
out
from
somewhere
and
the
soldier
left
me
and
darted
after
him
and
overtook
him
and
i
could
see
by
the
soldier's
excited
gestures
that
he
was
betraying
to
him
the
whole
shabby
business
the
station
master
was
plainly
very
angry
he
came
striding
down
toward
me
and
when
he
was
come
near
he
began
to
pour
out
a
stream
of
indignant
italian
then
suddenly
took
off
his
hat
and
made
that
beautiful
bow
and
said
oh
it
is
you!
i
beg
a
thousands
pardons!
this
idiot
here
he
turned
to
the
exulting
soldier
and
burst
out
with
a
flood
of
white
hot
italian
lava
and
the
next
moment
he
was
bowing
and
the
soldier
and
i
were
moving
in
procession
again
he
in
the
lead
and
ashamed
this
time
i
with
my
chin
up
and
so
we
marched
by
the
crowd
of
fascinated
passengers
and
i
went
forth
to
the
train

the
honors
of

it

an

as
the

there
must
have
been
a
large
distribution
of
acuteness
among
those
naked
skinny
aboriginals
or
they
couldn't
have
been
such
unapproachable
trackers
and
boomerangers
and
weet
weeters
it
must
have
been
race
aversion
that
put
upon
them
a
good
deal
of
the
low
rate
intellectual
reputation
which
they
bear
and
have
borne
this
long
time
in
the
world's
estimate
of
them
they
were
lazy
always
lazy
perhaps
that
was
their
trouble
it
is
a
killing
defect
surely
they
could
have
invented
and
built
a
competent
house
but
they
didn't
and
they
could
have
invented
and
developed
the
agricultural
arts
but
they
didn't
they
went
naked
and
houseless
and
lived
on
fish
and
grubs
and
worms
and
wild
fruits
and
were
just
plain
savages
for
all
their
smartness
with
a
country
as
big
as
the
united
states
to
live
and
multiply
in
and
with
no
epidemic
diseases
among
them
till
the
white
man
came
with
those
and
his
other
appliances
of
civilization
it
is
quite
probable
that
there
was
never
a
day
in
his
history
when
he
could
muster
100
000
of
his
race
in
all
australia
he
diligently
and
deliberately
kept
population
down
by
infanticide
largely
but
mainly
by
certain
other
methods
he
did
not
need
to
practise
these
artificialities
any
more
after
the
white
man
came
the
white
man
knew
ways
of
keeping
down
population
which
were
worth
several
of
his
the
white
man
knew
ways
of
reducing
a
native
population
80
percent
in
20
years
the
native
had
never
seen
anything
as
fine
as
that
before
for

there

of
the

a

eighty
times

came
along

of

000
lived
in
gippsland
a
patch
of
territory
the
size
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
rhode
islands
they
did
not
diminish
as
fast
as
some
of
the
other
communities
indeed
at
the
end
of
forty
years
there
were
still
200
of
them

the
geelong

more
satisfactorily
from
173
persons
it
faded
to
34
in
twenty
years
at
the
end
of
another
twenty
the
tribe
numbered
one
person
altogether
the
two
melbourne
tribes
could
muster
almost
300
when
the
white
man
came
they
could
muster
but
twenty
thirty
seven
years
later
in
1875
in
that
year
there
were
still
odds
and
ends
of
tribes
scattered
about
the
colony
of
victoria
but
i
was
told
that
natives
of
full
blood
are
very
scarce
now
it
is
said
that
the
aboriginals
continue
in
some
force
in
the
huge
territory
called
queensland
the
early
whites
were
not
used
to
savages
they
could
not
understand
the
primary
law
of
savage
life
that
if
a
man
do
you
a
wrong
his
whole
tribe
is
responsible
each
individual
of
it
and
you
may
take
your
change
out
of
any
individual
of
it
without
bothering
to
seek
out
the
guilty
one
when
a
white
killed
an
aboriginal
the
tribe
applied
the
ancient
law
and
killed
the
first
white
they
came
across
to
the
whites
this
was
a
monstrous
thing
extermination
seemed
to
be
the
proper
medicine
for
such
creatures
as
this
they
did
not
kill
all
the
blacks
but
they
promptly
killed
enough
of
them
to
make
their
own
persons
safe
from
the
dawn
of
civilization
down
to
this
day
the
white
man
has
always
used
that
very
precaution
mrs
campbell
praed
lived
in
queensland
as
a
child
in
the
early
days
and
in
her
sketches
of
australian
life
we
get
informing
pictures
of
the
early
struggles
of
the
white
and
the
black
to
reform
each
other
speaking
of
pioneer
days
in
the
mighty
wilderness
of
queensland
mrs
praed
says
at
first
the
natives
retreated
before
the
whites
and
except
that
they
every
now
and
then
speared
a
beast
in
one
of
the
herds
gave
little
cause
for
uneasiness
but
as
the
number
of
squatters
increased
each
one
taking
up
miles
of
country
and
bringing
two
or
three
men
in
his
train
so
that
shepherds'
huts
and
stockmen's
camps
lay
far
apart
and
defenseless
in
the
midst
of
hostile
tribes
the
blacks'
depredations
became
more
frequent
and
murder
was
no
unusual
event
the
loneliness
of
the
australian
bush
can
hardly
be
painted
in
words
here
extends
mile
after
mile
of
primeval
forest
where
perhaps
foot
of
white
man
has
never
trod
interminable
vistas
where
the
eucalyptus
trees
rear
their
lofty
trunks
and
spread
forth
their
lanky
limbs
from
which
the
red
gum
oozes
and
hangs
in
fantastic
pendants
like
crimson
stalactites
ravines
along
the
sides
of
which
the
long
bladed
grass
grows
rankly
level
untimbered
plains
alternating
with
undulating
tracts
of
pasture
here
and
there
broken
by
a
stony
ridge
steep
gully
or
dried
up
creek
all
wild
vast
and
desolate
all
the
same
monotonous
gray
coloring
except
where
the
wattle
when
in
blossom
shows
patches
of
feathery
gold
or
a
belt
of
scrub
lies
green
glossy
and
impenetrable
as
indian
jungle
the
solitude
seems
intensified
by
the
strange
sounds
of
reptiles
birds
and
insects
and
by
the
absence
of
larger
creatures
of
which
in
the
day
time
the
only
audible
signs
are
the
stampede
of
a
herd
of
kangaroo
or
the
rustle
of
a
wallabi
or
a
dingo
stirring
the
grass
as
it
creeps
to
its
lair
but
there
are
the
whirring
of
locusts
the
demoniac
chuckle
of
the
laughing
jack
ass
the
screeching
of
cockatoos
and
parrots
the
hissing
of
the
frilled
lizard
and
the
buzzing
of
innumerable
insects
hidden
under
the
dense
undergrowth
and
then
at
night
the
melancholy
wailing
of
the
curlews
the
dismal
howling
of
dingoes
the
discordant
croaking
of
tree
frogs
might
well
shake
the
nerves
of
the
solitary
watcher
that
is
the
theater
for
the
drama
when
you
comprehend
one
or
two
other
details
you
will
perceive
how
well
suited
for
trouble
it
was
and
how
loudly
it
invited
it
the
cattlemen's
stations
were
scattered
over
that
profound
wilderness
miles
and
miles
apart
at
each
station
half
a
dozen
persons
there
was
a
plenty
of
cattle
the
black
natives
were
always
ill
nourished
and
hungry
the
land
belonged
to
them
the
whites
had
not
bought
it
and
couldn't
buy
it
for
the
tribes
had
no
chiefs
nobody
in
authority
nobody
competent
to
sell
and
convey
and
the
tribes
themselves
had
no
comprehension
of
the
idea
of
transferable
ownership
of
land
the
ousted
owners
were
despised
by
the
white
interlopers
and
this
opinion
was
not
hidden
under
a
bushel
more
promising
materials
for
a
tragedy
could
not
have
been
collated
let
mrs
praed
speak
at
nie
station
one
dark
night
the
unsuspecting
hut
keeper
having
as
he
believed
secured
himself
against
assault
was
lying
wrapped
in
his
blankets
sleeping
profoundly
the
blacks
crept
stealthily
down
the
chimney
and
battered
in
his
skull
while
he
slept
one
could
guess
the
whole
drama
from
that
little
text
the
curtain
was
up
it
would
not
fall
until
the
mastership
of
one
party
or
the
other
was
determined
and
permanently
there
was
treachery
on
both
sides
the
blacks
killed
the
whites
when
they
found
them
defenseless
and
the
whites
slew
the
blacks
in
a
wholesale
and
promiscuous
fashion
which
offended
against
my
childish
sense
of
justice
they
were
regarded
as
little
above
the
level
of
brutes
and
in
some
cases
were
destroyed
like
vermin
here
is
an
instance
a
squatter
whose
station
was
surrounded
by
blacks
whom
he
suspected
to
be
hostile
and
from
whom
he
feared
an
attack
parleyed
with
them
from
his
house
door
he
told
them
it
was
christmas
time
a
time
at
which
all
men
black
or
white
feasted
that
there
were
flour
sugar
plums
good
things
in
plenty
in
the
store
and
that
he
would
make
for
them
such
a
pudding
as
they
had
never
dreamed
of
a
great
pudding
of
which
all
might
eat
and
be
filled
the
blacks
listened
and
were
lost
the
pudding
was
made
and
distributed
next
morning
there
was
howling
in
the
camp
for
it
had
been
sweetened
with
sugar
and
arsenic!
the
white
man's
spirit
was
right
but
his
method
was
wrong
his
spirit
was
the
spirit
which
the
civilized
white
has
always
exhibited
toward
the
savage
but
the
use
of
poison
was
a
departure
from
custom
true
it
was
merely
a
technical
departure
not
a
real
one
still
it
was
a
departure
and
therefore
a
mistake
in
my
opinion
it
was
better
kinder
swifter
and
much
more
humane
than
a
number
of
the
methods
which
have
been
sanctified
by
custom
but
that
does
not
justify
its
employment
that
is
it
does
not
wholly
justify
it
its
unusual
nature
makes
it
stand
out
and
attract
an
amount
of
attention
which
it
is
not
entitled
to
it
takes
hold
upon
morbid
imaginations
and
they
work
it
up
into
a
sort
of
exhibition
of
cruelty
and
this
smirches
the
good
name
of
our
civilization
whereas
one
of
the
old
harsher
methods
would
have
had
no
such
effect
because
usage
has
made
those
methods
familiar
to
us
and
innocent
in
many
countries
we
have
chained
the
savage
and
starved
him
to
death
and
this
we
do
not
care
for
because
custom
has
inured
us
to
it
yet
a
quick
death
by
poison
is
loving
kindness
to
it
in
many
countries
we
have
burned
the
savage
at
the
stake
and
this
we
do
not
care
for
because
custom
has
inured
us
to
it
yet
a
quick
death
is
loving
kindness
to
it
in
more
than
one
country
we
have
hunted
the
savage
and
his
little
children
and
their
mother
with
dogs
and
guns
through
the
woods
and
swamps
for
an
afternoon's
sport
and
filled
the
region
with
happy
laughter
over
their
sprawling
and
stumbling
flight
and
their
wild
supplications
for
mercy
but
this
method
we
do
not
mind
because
custom
has
inured
us
to
it
yet
a
quick
death
by
poison
is
loving
kindness
to
it
in
many
countries
we
have
taken
the
savage's
land
from
him
and
made
him
our
slave
and
lashed
him
every
day
and
broken
his
pride
and
made
death
his
only
friend
and
overworked
him
till
he
dropped
in
his
tracks
and
this
we
do
not
care
for
because
custom
has
inured
us
to
it
yet
a
quick
death
by
poison
is
loving
kindness
to
it
in
the
matabeleland
today
why
there
we
are
confining
ourselves
to
sanctified
custom
we
rhodes
beit
millionaires
in
south
africa
and
dukes
in
london
and
nobody
cares
because
we
are
used
to
the
old
holy
customs
and
all
we
ask
is
that
no
notice
inviting
new
ones
shall
be
intruded
upon
the
attention
of
our
comfortable
consciences
mrs
praed
says
of
the
poisoner
that
squatter
deserves
to
have
his
name
handed
down
to
the
contempt
of
posterity
i
am
sorry
to
hear
her
say
that
i
myself
blame
him
for
one
thing
and
severely
but
i
stop
there
i
blame
him
for
the
indiscretion
of
introducing
a
novelty
which
was
calculated
to
attract
attention
to
our
civilization
there
was
no
occasion
to
do
that
it
was
his
duty
and
it
is
every
loyal
man's
duty
to
protect
that
heritage
in
every
way
he
can
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
to
attract
attention
elsewhere
the
squatter's
judgment
was
bad
that
is
plain
but
his
heart
was
right
he
is
almost
the
only
pioneering
representative
of
civilization
in
history
who
has
risen
above
the
prejudices
of
his
caste
and
his
heredity
and
tried
to
introduce
the
element
of
mercy
into
the
superior
race's
dealings
with
the
savage
his
name
is
lost
and
it
is
a
pity
for
it
deserves
to
be
handed
down
to
posterity
with
homage
and
reverence

why
a

might
be

out
of

all
by
himself
his

so
freckled
with

you
do

in

line
he

and
they
will
not

authentic
in

preserved

by
force
he
courts
her
with

club
then
loves
her
faithfully
through

long
life
it
is
of
record
he
gathers
to
himself
another

by
the

processes
beats
and
bangs
her
as
a
daily
diversion
and
by
and
by
lays
down
his
life

defending
her
from

outside
harm
it
is
of
record
he
will
face
a
hundred
hostiles
to
rescue
one
of
his
children

will
kill
another
of
his
children
because
the
family
is
large
enough
without
it
his
delicate
stomach
turns
at
certain
details
of

he
likes
over
ripe
fish

cat
and
rat
and
will
eat
his

relish
he
is
a
sociable
animal
yet
he
turns
aside
and
hides
behind
his
shield
when
his
mother
in
law
goes
by
he
is
childishly
afraid
of
ghosts
and
other
trivialities
that
menace
his
soul

dread
of
physical
pain
is

weakness

he
has
a
correct
eye

and
draws
a
good
picture
he
can
track
a

by
delicate
traces
which
the
white
man's
eye
cannot
discern
and
by
methods
which
the
finest
white
intelligence
cannot
master
he
makes
a
missile
which
science
itself
cannot
duplicate
without
the
model
if
with
it
a
missile
whose
secret
baffled
and
defeated
the
searchings
and
theorizings
of
the
white
mathematicians
for
seventy
years
and
by
an
art
all
his
own
he
performs
miracles
with
it
which
the
white
man
cannot
approach
untaught
nor
parallel
after
teaching
within
certain
limits
this
savage's
intellect
is
the
alertest
and
the
brightest
known
to
history
or

yet
the
poor
creature

never
able
to
invent
a

system
that

some
things
which
i
wish
to
condense
slightly
and
insert
here
he
speaks
of
the
quickness
of
their
eyes
and
the
accuracy
of
their
judgment
of
the
direction
of
approaching
missiles
as
being
quite
extraordinary
and
of
the
answering
suppleness
and
accuracy
of
limb
and
muscle
in
avoiding
the

as
being
extraordinary

those
balls
properly
placed
could
have
killed
him
yet
he
depended
with
the
utmost
self
possession
on
the
quickness
of
his
eye
and
his
agility
the
shield
was
the
customary
war
shield
of
his
race
and
would
not
be
a
protection
to
you
or
to
me
it
is
no
broader
than
a
stovepipe
and
is
about
as
long
as
a
man's
arm
the
opposing
surface
is
not
flat
but
slopes
away
from
the
centerline
like
a
boat's
bow
the
difficulty
about
a
cricket
ball
that
has
been
thrown
with
a
scientific
twist
is
that
it
suddenly
changes
it
course
when
it
is
close
to
its
target
and
comes
straight
for
the
mark
when
apparently
it
was
going
overhead
or
to
one
side
i
should
not
be
able
to
protect
myself
from
such
balls
for
half
an
hour
or
less
mr
chauncy
once
saw
a
little
native
man
throw
a
cricket
ball
119
yards
this
is
said
to
beat
the
english
professional
record
by
thirteen
yards
we
have
all
seen
the
circus
man
bound
into
the
air
from
a
spring
board
and
make
a
somersault
over
eight
horses
standing
side
by
side
mr
chauncy
saw
an
aboriginal
do
it
over
eleven
and
was
assured
that
he
had
sometimes
done
it
over
fourteen
but
what
is
that
to
this
i
saw
the
same
man
leap
from
the
ground
and
in
going
over
he
dipped
his
head
unaided
by
his
hands
into
a
hat
placed
in
an
inverted
position
on
the
top
of
the
head
of
another
man
sitting
upright
on
horseback
both
man
and
horse
being
of
the
average
size
the
native
landed
on
the
other
side
of
the
horse
with
the
hat
fairly
on
his
head
the
prodigious
height
of
the
leap
and
the
precision
with
which
it
was
taken
so
as
to
enable
him
to
dip
his
head
into
the
hat
exceeded
any
feat
of
the
kind
i
have
ever
beheld
i
should
think
so!
on
board
a
ship
lately
i
saw
a
young
oxford
athlete
run
four
steps
and
spring
into
the
air
and
squirm
his
hips
by
a
side
twist
over
a
bar
that
was
five
and
one
half
feet
high
but
he
could
not
have
stood
still
and
cleared
a
bar
that
was
four
feet
high
i
know
this
because
i
tried
it
myself
one
can
see
now
where
the
kangaroo
learned
its
art
sir
george
grey
and
mr
eyre
testify
that
the
natives
dug
wells
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
deep
and
two
feet
in
diameter
at
the
bore
dug
them
in
the
sand
wells
that
were
quite
circular
carried
straight
down
and
the
work
beautifully
executed
their
tools
were
their
hands
and
feet
how
did
they
throw
sand
out
from
such
a
depth
how
could
they
stoop
down
and
get
it
with
only
two
feet
of
space
to
stoop
in
how
did
they
keep
that
sand
pipe
from
caving
in
on
them
i
do
not
know
still
they
did
manage
those
seeming
impossibilities
swallowed
the
sand
may
be
mr
chauncy
speaks
highly
of
the
patience
and
skill
and
alert
intelligence
of
the
native
huntsman
when
he
is
stalking
the
emu
the
kangaroo
and
other
game
as
he
walks
through
the
bush
his
step
is
light
elastic
and
noiseless
every
track
on
the
earth
catches
his
keen
eye
a
leaf
or
fragment
of
a
stick
turned
or
a
blade
of
grass
recently
bent
by
the
tread
of
one
of
the
lower
animals
instantly
arrests
his
attention
in
fact
nothing
escapes
his
quick
and
powerful
sight
on
the
ground
in
the
trees
or
in
the
distance
which
may
supply
him
with
a
meal
or
warn
him
of
danger
a
little
examination
of
the
trunk
of
a
tree
which
may
be
nearly
covered
with
the
scratches
of
opossums
ascending
and
descending
is
sufficient
to
inform
him
whether
one
went
up
the
night
before
without
coming
down
again
or
not
fennimore
cooper
lost
his
chance
he
would
have
known
how
to
value
these
people
he
wouldn't
have
traded
the
dullest
of
them
for
the
brightest
mohawk
he
ever
invented
all
savages
draw
outline
pictures
upon
bark
but
the
resemblances
are
not
close
and
expression
is
usually
lacking
but
the
australian
aboriginal's
pictures
of
animals
were
nicely
accurate
in
form
attitude
carriage
and
he
put
spirit
into
them
and
expression
and
his
pictures
of
white
people
and
natives
were
pretty
nearly
as
good
as
his
pictures
of
the
other
animals
he
dressed
his
whites
in
the
fashion
of
their
day
both
the
ladies
and
the
gentlemen
as
an
untaught
wielder
of
the
pencil
it
is
not
likely
that
he
has
had
his
equal
among
savage
people
his
place
in
art
as
to
drawing
not
color
work
is
well
up
all
things
considered
his
art
is
not
to
be
classified
with
savage
art
at
all
but
on
a
plane
two
degrees
above
it
and
one
degree
above
the
lowest
plane
of
civilized
art
to
be
exact
his
place
in
art
is
between
botticelli
and
de
maurier
that
is
to
say
he
could
not
draw
as
well
as
de
maurier
but
better
than
boticelli
in
feeling
he
resembles
both
also
in
grouping
and
in
his
preferences
in
the
matter
of
subjects
his
corrobboree
of
the
australian
wilds
reappears
in
de
maurier's
belgravian
ballrooms
with
clothes
and
the
smirk
of
civilization
added
botticelli's
spring
is
the
corrobboree
further
idealized
but
with
fewer
clothes
and
more
smirk
and
well
enough
as
to
intention
but
my
word!
the
aboriginal
can
make
a
fire
by
friction
i
have
tried
that
all
savages
are
able
to
stand
a
good
deal
of
physical
pain
the
australian
aboriginal
has
this
quality
in
a
well
developed
degree
do
not
read
the
following
instances
if
horrors
are
not
pleasant
to
you
they
were
recorded
by
the
rev
henry
n
wolloston
of
melbourne
who
had
been
a
surgeon
before
he
became
a
clergyman
1
in
the
summer
of
1852
i
started
on
horseback
from
albany
king
george's
sound
to
visit
at
cape
riche
accompanied
by
a
native
on
foot
we
traveled
about
forty
miles
the
first
day
then
camped
by
a
water
hole
for
the
night
after
cooking
and
eating
our
supper
i
observed
the
native
who
had
said
nothing
to
me
on
the
subject
collect
the
hot
embers
of
the
fire
together
and
deliberately
place
his
right
foot
in
the
glowing
mass
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
withdraw
it
stamping
on
the
ground
and
uttering
a
long
drawn
guttural
sound
of
mingled
pain
and
satisfaction
this
operation
he
repeated
several
times
on
my
inquiring
the
meaning
of
his
strange
conduct
he
only
said
'me
carpenter
make
'em'
'i
am
mending
my
foot'
and
then
showed
me
his
charred
great
toe
the
nail
of
which
had
been
torn
off
by
a
tea
tree
stump
in
which
it
had
been
caught
during
the
journey
and
the
pain
of
which
he
had
borne
with
stoical
composure
until
the
evening
when
he
had
an
opportunity
of
cauterizing
the
wound
in
the
primitive
manner
above
described
and
he
proceeded
on
the
journey
the
next
day
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
walked
thirty
miles
it
was
a
strange
idea
to
keep
a
surgeon
and
then
do
his
own
surgery
2
a
native
about
twenty
five
years
of
age
once
applied
to
me
as
a
doctor
to
extract
the
wooden
barb
of
a
spear
which
during
a
fight
in
the
bush
some
four
months
previously
had
entered
his
chest
just
missing
the
heart
and
penetrated
the
viscera
to
a
considerable
depth
the
spear
had
been
cut
off
leaving
the
barb
behind
which
continued
to
force
its
way
by
muscular
action
gradually
toward
the
back
and
when
i
examined
him
i
could
feel
a
hard
substance
between
the
ribs
below
the
left
blade
bone
i
made
a
deep
incision
and
with
a
pair
of
forceps
extracted
the
barb
which
was
made
as
usual
of
hard
wood
about
four
inches
long
and
from
half
an
inch
to
an
inch
thick
it
was
very
smooth
and
partly
digested
so
to
speak
by
the
maceration
to
which
it
had
been
exposed
during
its
four
months'
journey
through
the
body
the
wound
made
by
the
spear
had
long
since
healed
leaving
only
a
small
cicatrix
and
after
the
operation
which
the
native
bore
without
flinching
he
appeared
to
suffer
no
pain
indeed
judging
from
his
good
state
of
health
the
presence
of
the
foreign
matter
did
not
materially
annoy
him
he
was
perfectly
well
in
a
few
days
but
no
3
is
my
favorite
whenever
i
read
it
i
seem
to
enjoy
all
that
the
patient
enjoyed
whatever
it
was
3
once
at
king
george's
sound
a
native
presented
himself
to
me
with
one
leg
only
and
requested
me
to
supply
him
with
a
wooden
leg
he
had
traveled
in
this
maimed
state
about
ninety
six
miles
for
this
purpose
i
examined
the
limb
which
had
been
severed
just
below
the
knee
and
found
that
it
had
been
charred
by
fire
while
about
two
inches
of
the
partially
calcined
bone
protruded
through
the
flesh
i
at
once
removed
this
with
the
saw
and
having
made
as
presentable
a
stump
of
it
as
i
could
covered
the
amputated
end
of
the
bone
with
a
surrounding
of
muscle
and
kept
the
patient
a
few
days
under
my
care
to
allow
the
wound
to
heal
on
inquiring
the
native
told
me
that
in
a
fight
with
other
black
fellows
a
spear
had
struck
his
leg
and
penetrated
the
bone
below
the
knee
finding
it
was
serious
he
had
recourse
to
the
following
crude
and
barbarous
operation
which
it
appears
is
not
uncommon
among
these
people
in
their
native
state
he
made
a
fire
and
dug
a
hole
in
the
earth
only
sufficiently
large
to
admit
his
leg
and
deep
enough
to
allow
the
wounded
part
to
be
on
a
level
with
the
surface
of
the
ground
he
then
surrounded
the
limb
with
the
live
coals
or
charcoal
which
was
replenished
until
the
leg
was
literally
burnt
off
the
cauterization
thus
applied
completely
checked
the
hemorrhage
and
he
was
able
in
a
day
or
two
to
hobble
down
to
the
sound
with
the
aid
of
a
long
stout
stick
although
he
was
more
than
a
week
on
the
road
but
he
was
a
fastidious
native
he
soon
discarded
the
wooden
leg
made
for
him
by
the
doctor
because
it
had
no
feeling
in
it
it
must
have
had
as
much
as
the
one
he
burnt
off
i
should
think
so
much
for
the
aboriginals
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
let
them
alone
they
are
marvelously
interesting
creatures
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
now
the
several
colonial
governments
have
housed
their
remnants
in
comfortable
stations
and
fed
them
well
and
taken
good
care
of
them
in
every
way
if
i
had
found
this
out
while
i
was
in
australia
i
could
have
seen
some
of
those
people
but
i
didn't

to

only
a

of
the
words

it

and
every

perfect
the
full

of
the

is
upon

and
i
imagine
i
can
see
it
grow
alongside

and
a

back
in
the

there
is
a
row
of
soaring
fountain
sprays
of
delicate
feathery
foliage
quivering
in

and
mottled
with
flashes
of

that
shift

would
have
been
a

there
was

it

there

the

was

think
we
should
not

the
width
was
but
i
did
not
pursue
the
matter
i
think
it
is
best
to
put
up
with
information
the
way
you
get
it
and
seem
satisfied
with
it
and
surprised
at
it
and
grateful
for
it
and
say
my
word!
and
never
let
on
it
was
a
wide
space
i
could
tell
you
how
wide
in
chains
and
perches
and
furlongs
and
things
but
that
would
not
help
you
any
those
things
sound
well
but
they
are
shadowy
and
indefinite
like
troy
weight
and
avoirdupois
nobody
knows
what
they
mean
when
you
buy
a
pound
of
a
drug
and
the
man
asks
you
which
you
want
troy
or
avoirdupois
it
is
best
to
say
yes
and
shift
the
subject
they
said
that
the
wide
space
dates
from
the
earliest
sheep
and
cattle
raising
days
people
had
to
drive
their
stock
long
distances
immense
journeys
from
worn
out
places
to
new
ones
where
were
water
and
fresh
pasturage
and
this
wide
space
had
to
be
left
in
grass
and
unfenced
or
the
stock
would
have
starved
to
death
in
the
transit
on
the
way
we
saw
the
usual
birds
the
beautiful
little
green
parrots
the
magpie
and
some
others
and
also
the
slender
native
bird
of
modest
plumage
and
the
eternally
forgettable
name
the
bird
that
is
the
smartest
among
birds
and
can
give
a
parrot
30
to
1
in
the
game
and
then
talk
him
to
death
i
cannot
recall
that
bird's
name
i
think
it
begins
with
m
i
wish
it
began
with
g
or
something
that
a
person
can
remember
the
magpie
was
out
in
great
force
in
the
fields
and
on
the
fences
he
is
a
handsome
large
creature
with
snowy
white
decorations
and
is
a
singer
he
has
a
murmurous
rich
note
that
is
lovely
he
was
once
modest
even
diffident
but
he
lost
all
that
when
he
found
out
that
he
was
australia's
sole
musical
bird
he
has
talent
and
cuteness
and
impudence
and
in
his
tame
state
he
is
a
most
satisfactory
pet
never
coming
when
he
is
called
always
coming
when
he
isn't
and
studying
disobedience
as
an
accomplishment
he
is
not
confined
but
loafs
all
over
the
house
and
grounds
like
the
laughing
jackass
i
think
he
learns
to
talk
i
know
he
learns
to
sing
tunes
and
his
friends
say
that
he
knows
how
to
steal
without
learning
i
was
acquainted
with
a
tame
magpie
in
melbourne
he
had
lived
in
a
lady's
house
several
years
and
believed
he
owned
it
the
lady
had
tamed
him
and
in
return
he
had
tamed
the
lady
he
was
always
on
deck
when
not
wanted
always
having
his
own
way
always
tyrannizing
over
the
dog
and
always
making
the
cat's
life
a
slow
sorrow
and
a
martyrdom
he
knew
a
number
of
tunes
and
could
sing
them
in
perfect
time
and
tune
and
would
do
it
too
at
any
time
that
silence
was
wanted
and
then
encore
himself
and
do
it
again
but
if
he
was
asked
to
sing
he
would
go
out
and
take
a
walk
it
was
long
believed
that
fruit
trees
would
not
grow
in
that
baked
and
waterless
plain
around
horsham
but
the
agricultural
college
has
dissipated
that
idea
its
ample
nurseries
were
producing
oranges
apricots
lemons
almonds
peaches
cherries
48
varieties
of
apples
in
fact
all
manner
of
fruits
and
in
abundance
the
trees
did
not
seem
to
miss
the
water
they
were
in
vigorous
and
flourishing
condition
experiments
are
made
with
different
soils
to
see
what
things
thrive
best
in
them
and
what
climates
are
best
for
them
a
man
who
is
ignorantly
trying
to
produce
upon
his
farm
things
not
suited
to
its
soil
and
its
other
conditions
can
make
a
journey
to
the
college
from
anywhere
in
australia
and
go
back
with
a
change
of
scheme
which
will
make
his
farm
productive
and
profitable
there
were
forty
pupils
there
a
few
of
them
farmers
relearning
their
trade
the
rest
young
men
mainly
from
the
cities
novices
it
seemed
a
strange
thing
that
an
agricultural
college
should
have
an
attraction
for
city
bred
youths
but
such
is
the
fact
they
are
good
stuff
too
they
are
above
the
agricultural
average
of
intelligence
and
they
come
without
any
inherited
prejudices
in
favor
of
hoary
ignorances
made
sacred
by
long
descent
the
students
work
all
day
in
the
fields
the
nurseries
and
the
shearing
sheds

and

all
the
practical
work
of
the
business
three
days
in

on
the

and

are

beginnings
of
such
sciences
as
bear
upon
agriculture
like
chemistry
for
instance
we
saw
the
sophomore
class
in
sheep
shearing
shear
a
dozen
sheep
they
did
it
by
hand
not
with
the
machine
the
sheep
was
seized
and
flung
down
on
his
side
and
held
there
and
the
students
took
off
his
coat
with
great
celerity
and
adroitness
sometimes
they
clipped
off
a
sample
of
the
sheep
but
that
is
customary
with
shearers
and
they
don't
mind
it
they
don't
even
mind
it
as
much
as
the
sheep
they
dab
a
splotch
of
sheep
dip
on
the
place
and
go
right
ahead
the
coat
of
wool
was
unbelievably
thick
before
the
shearing
the
sheep
looked
like
the
fat
woman
in
the
circus
after
it
he
looked
like
a
bench
he
was
clipped
to
the
skin
and
smoothly
and
uniformly
the

comes
from
him
all
in

there
were
a

the

one

these

the

as

its

it

its

on

to

we
had
a
chance
to
see
a
group
of
boulders
called
the

a
curiosity
oddly
located
for
it
was
upon
high

with
the

sloping
away
from
it

no

above
it

whence
the
boulders
could
have
rolled
down

early

perhaps
they
are
noble

one
of
them

the
size
and
smoothness

plump
sphericity

the
road
led
through
a
forest
of
great
gum
trees
lean
and
scraggy
and
sorrowful
the
road
was
cream
white
a
clayey
kind
of
earth
apparently
along
it
toiled
occasional
freight

drawn
by
long
double
files
of

those
wagons
were

it

detect
the

crept
in

we
had
this
kind
of
scenery
finely
staged
all
the
way
to
ballarat
consequently
we
saw
more
sky
than
country
on
that
journey
at
one
time
a
great
stretch
of
the
vault
was
densely
flecked
with
wee
ragged

flakes
of
painfully
white
cloud
stuff
all
of
one
shape

and
equidistant
apart
with
narrow
cracks
of

showing
between
the
whole
was
suggestive
of
a
hurricane
of

drifting
across

by

themselves
together

solidified
itself
then
gradually
broke
up
its
mass
into
innumerable
lofty
white
pillars
of
about
one

ranged
these
across
the

and

here
the

it
scraped
up
two

a
half
of
gold
the

day
worth
$600
a

ballarat
was
a

region
for

no
such
nuggets
were
found
in

as
ballarat
produced
in

the
ballarat
region
has
yielded
the
largest
ones
known
to
history
two
of
them
weighed
about
180
pounds
each
and
together
were
worth
$90
000
they
were
offered
to
any
poor
person
who
would
shoulder
them
and
carry
them
away
gold
was
so
plentiful
that
it
made
people
liberal
like
that
ballarat
was
a
swarming
city
of
tents
in
the
early
days
everybody
was
happy
for
a
time
and
apparently
prosperous
then
came
trouble
the
government
swooped
down
with
a
mining
tax
and
in
its
worst
form
too
for
it
was
not
a
tax
upon
what
the
miner
had
taken
out
but
upon
what
he
was
going
to
take
out
if
he
could
find
it
it
was
a
license
tax
license
to
work
his
claim
and
it
had
to
be
paid
before
he
could
begin
digging
consider
the
situation
no
business
is
so
uncertain
as
surface
mining
your
claim
may
be
good
and
it
may
be
worthless
it
may
make
you
well
off
in
a
month
and
then
again
you
may
have
to
dig
and
slave
for
half
a
year
at
heavy
expense
only
to
find
out
at
last
that
the
gold
is
not
there
in
cost
paying
quantity
and
that
your
time
and
your
hard
work
have
been
thrown
away
it
might
be
wise
policy
to
advance
the
miner
a
monthly
sum
to
encourage
him
to
develop
the
country's
riches
but
to
tax
him
monthly
in
advance
instead
why
such
a
thing
was
never
dreamed
of
in
america
there
neither
the
claim
itself
nor
its
products
howsoever
rich
or
poor
were
taxed
the
ballarat
miners
protested
petitioned
complained
it
was
of
no
use
the
government
held
its
ground
and
went
on
collecting
the
tax
and
not
by
pleasant
methods
but
by
ways
which
must
have
been
very
galling
to
free
people
the
rumblings
of
a
coming
storm
began
to
be
audible
by
and
by
there
was
a
result
and
i
think
it
may
be
called
the
finest
thing
in
australasian
history
it
was
a
revolution
small
in
size
but
great
politically
it
was
a
strike
for
liberty
a
struggle
for
a
principle
a
stand
against
injustice
and
oppression
it
was
the
barons
and
john
over
again
it
was
hampden
and
ship
money
it
was
concord
and
lexington
small
beginnings
all
of
them
but
all
of
them
great
in
political
results
all
of
them
epoch
making
it
is
another
instance
of
a
victory
won
by
a
lost
battle
it
adds
an
honorable
page
to
history
the
people
know
it
and
are
proud
of
it
they
keep
green
the
memory
of
the
men
who
fell
at
the
eureka
stockade
and
peter
lalor
has
his
monument
the
surface
soil
of
ballarat
was
full
of
gold
this
soil
the
miners
ripped
and
tore
and
trenched
and
harried
and
disembowled
and
made
it
yield
up
its
immense
treasure
then
they
went
down
into
the
earth
with
deep
shafts
seeking
the
gravelly
beds
of
ancient
rivers
and
brooks
and
found
them
they
followed
the
courses
of
these
streams
and
gutted
them
sending
the
gravel
up
in
buckets
to
the
upper
world
and
washing
out
of
it
its
enormous
deposits
of
gold
the
next
biggest
of
the
two
monster
nuggets
mentioned
above
came
from
an
old
river
channel
180
feet
under
ground
finally
the
quartz
lodes
were
attacked
that
is
not
poor
man's
mining
quartz
mining
and
milling
require
capital
and
staying
power
and
patience
big
companies
were
formed
and
for
several
decades
now
the
lodes
have
been
successfully
worked
and
have
yielded
great
wealth
since
the
gold
discovery
in
1853
the
ballarat
mines
taking
the
three
kinds
of
mining
together
have
contributed
to
the
world's
pocket
something
over
three
hundred
millions
of
dollars
which
is
to
say
that
this
nearly
invisible
little
spot
on
the
earth's
surface
has
yielded
about
one
fourth
as
much
gold
in
forty
four
years
as
all
california
has
yielded
in
forty
seven
the
californian
aggregate
from
1848
to
1895
inclusive
as
reported
by
the
statistician
of
the
united
states
mint
is
$1

a
citizen
told
me
a
curious
thing
about
those
mines
with
all
my
experience
of
mining
i
had
never
heard
of
anything
of
the
sort
before
the
main
gold
reef
runs
about
north
and
south
of
course
for
that
is
the
custom
of
a
rich
gold
reef
at
ballarat
its
course
is
between
walls
of
slate
now
the
citizen
told
me
that
throughout
a
stretch
of
twelve
miles
along
the
reef
the
reef
is
crossed
at
intervals
by
a
straight
black
streak
of
a
carbonaceous
nature
a
streak
in
the
slate
a
streak
no
thicker
than
a
pencil
and
that
wherever
it
crosses
the
reef
you
will
certainly
find
gold
at
the
junction
it
is
called
the
indicator
thirty
feet
on
each
side
of
the
indicator
and
down
in
the
slate
of
course
is
a
still
finer
streak
a
streak
as
fine
as
a
pencil
mark
and
indeed
that
is
its
name
pencil
mark
whenever
you
find
the
pencil
mark
you
know
that
thirty
feet
from
it
is
the
indicator
you
measure
the
distance
excavate
find
the
indicator
trace
it
straight
to
the
reef
and
sink
your
shaft
your
fortune
is
made
for
certain
if
that
is
true
it
is
curious
and
it
is
curious
anyway
ballarat
is
a
town
of
only
40
000
population
and
yet
since
it
is
in
australia
it
has
every
essential
of
an
advanced
and
enlightened
big
city
this
is
pure
matter
of
course
i
must
stop
dwelling
upon
these
things
it
is
hard
to
keep
from
dwelling
upon
them
though
for
it
is
difficult
to
get
away
from
the
surprise
of
it
i
will
let
the
other
details
go
this
time
but
i
must
allow
myself
to
mention
that
this
little
town
has
a
park
of
326
acres
a
flower
garden
of
83
acres
with
an
elaborate
and
expensive
fernery
in
it
and
some
costly
and
unusually
fine
statuary
and
an
artificial
lake
covering
600
acres
equipped
with
a
fleet
of
200
shells
small
sail
boats
and
little
steam
yachts
at
this
point
i
strike
out
some
other
praiseful
things
which
i
was
tempted
to
add
i
do
not
strike
them
out
because
they
were
not
true
or
not
well
said
but
because
i
find
them
better
said
by
another
man
and
a
man
more
competent
to
testify
too
because
he
belongs
on
the
ground
and
knows
i
clip
them
from
a
chatty
speech
delivered
some
years
ago
by
mr
william
little
who
was
at
that
time
mayor
of
ballarat
the
language
of
our
citizens
in
this
as
in
other
parts
of
australasia
is
mostly
healthy
anglo
saxon
free
from
americanisms
vulgarisms
and
the
conflicting
dialects
of
our
fatherland
and
is
pure
enough
to
suit
a
trench
or
a
latham
our
youth
aided
by
climatic
influence
are
in
point
of
physique
and
comeliness
unsurpassed
in
the
sunny
south
our
young
men
are
well
ordered
and
our
maidens
'not
stepping
over
the
bounds
of
modesty
'
are
as
fair
as
psyches
dispensing
smiles
as
charming
as
november
flowers
the
closing
clause
has
the
seeming
of
a
rather
frosty
compliment
but
that
is
apparent
only
not
real
november
is
summer
time
there
his
compliment
to
the
local
purity
of
the
language
is
warranted
it
is
quite
free
from
impurities
this
is
acknowledged
far
and
wide
as
in
the
german
empire
all
cultivated
people
claim
to
speak
hanovarian
german
so
in
australasia
all
cultivated
people
claim
to
speak
ballarat
english
even
in
england
this
cult
has
made
considerable
progress
and
now
that
it
is
favored
by
the
two
great
universities
the
time
is
not
far
away
when
ballarat
english
will
come
into
general
use
among
the
educated
classes
of
great
britain
at
large
its
great
merit
is
that
it
is
shorter
than
ordinary
english
that
is
it
is
more
compressed
at
first
you
have
some
difficulty
in
understanding
it
when
it
is
spoken
as
rapidly
as
the
orator
whom
i
have
quoted
speaks
it
an
illustration
will
show
what
i
mean
when
he
called
and
i
handed
him
a
chair
he
bowed
and
said
q
presently
when
we
were
lighting
our
cigars
he
held
a
match
to
mine
and
i
said
thank
you
and
he
said
km
then
i
saw
'q'
is
the
end
of
the
phrase
i
thank
you
'km'
is
the
end
of
the
phrase
you
are
welcome
mr
little
puts
no
emphasis
upon
either
of
them
but
delivers
them
so
reduced
that
they
hardly
have
a
sound
all
ballarat
english
is
like
that
and
the
effect
is
very
soft
and
pleasant
it
takes
all
the
hardness
and
harshness
out
of
our
tongue
and
gives
to
it
a
delicate
whispery
and
vanishing
cadence
which
charms
the
ear
like
the
faint
rustling
of
the
forest
leaves

one
of
the
rich
gold
fields
of
the
early
days
waited
several
hours
for
a
train
left
at

and
reached
bendigo
in
an
hour
for
comrade
a
catholic
priest
who
was
better
than
i
was
but
didn't
seem
to
know
it
a
man
full
of
graces
of
the
heart
the
mind
and
the
spirit
a
lovable
man
he
will
rise
he
will
be
a
bishop
some
day
later
an
archbishop
later
a
cardinal
finally
an
archangel
i
hope
and
then
he
will
recall
me
when
i
say
do
you
remember
that
trip
we
made
from
ballarat
to
bendigo
when
you
were
nothing
but
father
c
and
i
was
nothing
to
what
i
am
now
it
has
actually
taken
nine
hours
to
come
from
ballarat
to
bendigo
we
could
have
saved
seven
by
walking
however
there
was
no
hurry
bendigo
was
another
of
the
rich
strikes
of
the
early
days
it
does
a
great
quartz
mining
business
now
that
business
which
more
than
any
other
that
i
know
of
teaches
patience
and
requires
grit
and
a
steady
nerve
the
town
is
full
of
towering
chimney
stacks
and
hoisting
works
and
looks
like
a
petroleum
city
speaking
of
patience
for
example
one
of
the
local
companies
went
steadily
on
with
its
deep
borings
and
searchings
without
show
of
gold
or
a
penny
of
reward
for
eleven
years
then
struck
it
and
became
suddenly
rich
the
eleven
years'
work
had
cost
$55
000
and
the
first
gold
found
was
a
grain
the
size
of
a
pin's
head
it
is
kept
under
locks
and
bars
as
a
precious
thing
and
is
reverently
shown
to
the
visitor
hats
off
when
i
saw
it
i
had
not
heard
its
history
it
is
gold
examine
it
take
the
glass
now
how
much
should
you
say
it
is
worth
i
said
i
should
say
about
two
cents
or
in
your
english
dialect
four
farthings
well
it
cost
l11
000
oh
come!
yes
it
did
ballarat
and
bendigo
have
produced
the
three
monumental
nuggets
of
the
world
and
this
one
is
the
monumentalest
one
of
the
three
the
other
two
represent
19
000
a
piece
this
one
a
couple
of
thousand
more
it
is
small
and
not
much
to
look
at
but
it
is
entitled
to
its
name
adam
it
is
the
adam
nugget
of
this
mine
and
its
children
run
up
into
the
millions
speaking
of
patience
again
another
of
the
mines
was
worked
under
heavy
expenses
during
17
years
before
pay
was
struck
and
still
another
one
compelled
a
wait
of
21
years
before
pay
was
struck
then
in
both
instances
the
outlay
was
all
back
in
a
year
or
two
with
compound
interest
bendigo
has
turned
out
even
more
gold
than
ballarat
the
two
together
have
produced
$650
000
000
worth
which
is
half
as
much
as
california
has
produced
it
was
through
mr
blank
not
to
go
into
particulars
about
his
name
it
was
mainly
through
mr
blank
that
my
stay
in
bendigo
was
made
memorably
pleasant
and
interesting
he
explained
this
to
me
himself
he
told
me
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
the
city
government
invited
me
to
the
town
hall
to
hear
complimentary
speeches
and
respond
to
them
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
i
had
been
taken
on
a
long
pleasure
drive
through
the
city
and
shown
its
notable
features
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
i
was
invited
to
visit
the
great
mines
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
i
was
taken
to
the
hospital
and
allowed
to
see
the
convalescent
chinaman
who
had
been
attacked
at
midnight
in
his
lonely
hut
eight
weeks
before
by
robbers
and
stabbed
forty
six
times
and
scalped
besides
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
when
i
arrived
this
awful
spectacle
of
piecings
and
patchings
and
bandagings
was
sitting
up
in
his
cot
letting
on
to
read
one
of
my
books
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
efforts
had
been
made
to
get
the
catholic
archbishop
of
bendigo
to
invite
me
to
dinner
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
efforts
had
been
made
to
get
the
anglican
bishop
of
bendigo
to
ask
me
to
supper
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
the
dean
of
the
editorial
fraternity
had
driven
me
through
the
woodsy
outlying
country
and
shown
me
from
the
summit
of
lone
tree
hill
the
mightiest
and
loveliest
expanse
of
forest
clad
mountain
and
valley
that
i
had
seen
in
all
australia
and
when
he
asked
me
what
had
most
impressed
me
in
bendigo
and
i
answered
and
said
it
was
the
taste
and
the
public
spirit
which
had
adorned
the
streets
with
105
miles
of
shade
trees
he
said
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
it
had
been
done
but
i
am
not
representing
him
quite
correctly
he
did
not
say
it
was
through
his
influence
that
all
these
things
had
happened
for
that
would
have
been
coarse
be
merely
conveyed
that
idea
conveyed
it
so
subtly
that
i
only
caught
it
fleetingly
as
one
catches
vagrant
faint
breaths
of
perfume
when
one
traverses
the
meadows
in
summer
conveyed
it
without
offense
and
without
any
suggestion
of
egoism
or
ostentation
but
conveyed
it
nevertheless
he
was
an
irishman
an
educated
gentleman
grave
and
kindly
and
courteous
a
bachelor
and
about
forty
five
or
possibly
fifty
years
old
apparently
he
called
upon
me
at
the
hotel
and
it
was
there
that
we
had
this
talk
he
made
me
like
him
and
did
it
without
trouble
this
was
partly
through
his
winning
and
gentle
ways
but
mainly
through
the
amazing
familiarity
with
my
books
which
his
conversation
showed
he
was
down
to
date
with
them
too
and
if
he
had
made
them
the
study
of
his
life
he
could
hardly
have
been
better
posted
as
to
their
contents
than
he
was
he
made
me
better
satisfied
with
myself
than
i
had
ever
been
before
it
was
plain
that
he
had
a
deep
fondness
for
humor
yet
he
never
laughed
he
never
even
chuckled
in
fact
humor
could
not
win
to
outward
expression
on
his
face
at
all
no
he
was
always
grave
tenderly
pensively
grave
but
he
made
me
laugh
all
along
and
this
was
very
trying
and
very
pleasant
at
the
same
time
for
it
was
at
quotations
from
my
own
books
when
he
was
going
he
turned
and
said
you
don't
remember
me
i
why
no
have
we
met
before
no
it
was
a
matter
of
correspondence
correspondence
yes
many
years
ago
twelve
or
fifteen
oh
longer
than
that
but
of
course
you
a
musing
pause
then
he
said
do
you
remember
corrigan
castle
n
no
i
believe
i
don't
i
don't
seem
to
recall
the
name
he
waited
a
moment
pondering
with
the
door
knob
in
his
hand
then
started
out
but
turned
back
and
said
that
i
had
once
been
interested
in
corrigan
castle
and
asked
me
if
i
would
go
with
him
to
his
quarters
in
the
evening
and
take
a
hot
scotch
and
talk
it
over
i
was
a
teetotaler
and
liked
relaxation
so
i
said
i
would
we
drove
from
the
lecture
hall
together
about
half
past
ten
he
had
a
most
comfortably
and
tastefully
furnished
parlor
with
good
pictures
on
the
walls
indian
and
japanese
ornaments
on
the
mantel
and
here
and
there
and
books
everywhere
largely
mine
which
made
me
proud
the
light
was
brilliant
the
easy
chairs
were
deep
cushioned
the
arrangements
for
brewing
and
smoking
were
all
there
we
brewed
and
lit
up
then
he
passed
a
sheet
of
note
paper
to
me
and
said
do
you
remember
that
oh
yes
indeed!
the
paper
was
of
a
sumptuous
quality
at
the
top
was
a
twisted
and
interlaced
monogram
printed
from
steel
dies
in
gold
and
blue
and
red
in
the
ornate
english
fashion
of
long
years
ago
and
under
it
in
neat
gothic
capitals
was
this
printed
in
blue

my!
said
i
how
did
you
come
by
this
i
was

of

no!
you
don't
mean
it
it
is
true
i
was
its
first
president
i
was
re
elected
annually
as
long
as
its
meetings
were
held
in
my
castle
corrigan
which
was
five
years
then
he
showed
me
an
album
with
twenty
three
photographs
of
me
in
it
five
of
them
were
of
old
dates
the
others
of

closed

was
paradise!
we
ran
late
and
talked
talked
talked
subject
the
mark
twain
club
of
corrigan
castle
ireland
my
first
knowledge
of
that
club
dates
away
back
all
of
twenty
years
i
should
say
it
came
to
me
in
the
form
of
a
courteous
letter
written
on
the
note
paper
which
i
have
described
and
signed
by
order
of
the
president
c
pembroke
secretary
it
conveyed
the
fact
that
the
club
had
been
created
in
my
honor
and
added
the
hope
that
this
token
of
appreciation
of
my
work
would
meet
with
my
approval
i
answered
with
thanks
and
did
what
i
could
to
keep
my
gratification
from
over
exposure
it
was
then
that
the
long
correspondence
began
a
letter
came
back
by
order
of
the
president
furnishing
me
the
names
of
the
members
thirty
two
in
number
with
it
came
a
copy
of
the
constitution
and
by
laws
in
pamphlet
form
and
artistically
printed
the
initiation
fee
and
dues
were
in
their
proper
place
also
schedule
of
meetings
monthly
for
essays
upon
works
of
mine
followed
by
discussions
quarterly
for
business
and
a
supper
without
essays
but
with
after
supper
speeches
also
there
was
a
list
of
the
officers
president
vice
president
secretary
treasurer
etc
the
letter
was
brief
but
it
was
pleasant
reading
for
it
told
me
about
the
strong
interest
which
the
membership
took
in
their
new
venture
etc
etc
it
also
asked
me
for
a
photograph
a
special
one
i
went
down
and
sat
for
it
and
sent
it
with
a
letter
of
course
presently
came
the
badge
of
the
club
and
very
dainty
and
pretty
it
was
and
very
artistic
it
was
a
frog
peeping
out
from
a
graceful
tangle
of
grass
sprays
and
rushes
and
was
done
in
enamels
on
a
gold
basis
and
had
a
gold
pin
back
of
it
after
i
had
petted
it
and
played
with
it
and
caressed
it
and
enjoyed
it
a
couple
of
hours
the
light
happened
to
fall
upon
it
at
a
new
angle
and
revealed
to
me
a
cunning
new
detail
with
the
light
just
right
certain
delicate
shadings
of
the
grass
blades
and
rush
stems
wove
themselves
into
a
monogram
mine!
you
can
see
that
that
jewel
was
a
work
of
art
and
when
you
come
to
consider
the
intrinsic
value
of
it
you
must
concede
that
it
is
not
every
literary
club
that
could
afford
a
badge
like
that
it
was
easily
worth
$75
in
the
opinion
of
messrs
marcus
and
ward
of
new
york
they
said
they
could
not
duplicate
it
for
that
and
make
a
profit
by
this
time
the
club
was
well
under
way
and
from
that
time
forth
its
secretary
kept
my
off
hours
well
supplied
with
business
he
reported
the
club's
discussions
of
my
books
with
laborious
fullness
and
did
his
work
with
great
spirit
and
ability
as
a
rule
he
synopsized
but
when
a
speech
was
especially
brilliant
he
short
handed
it
and
gave
me
the
best
passages
from
it
written
out
there
were
five
speakers
whom
he
particularly
favored
in
that
way
palmer
forbes
naylor
norris
and
calder
palmer
and
forbes
could
never
get
through
a
speech
without
attacking
each
other
and
each
in
his
own
way
was
formidably
effective
palmer
in
virile
and
eloquent
abuse
forbes
in
courtly
and
elegant
but
scalding
satire
i
could
always
tell
which
of
them
was
talking
without
looking
for
his
name
naylor
had
a
polished
style
and
a
happy
knack
at
felicitous
metaphor
norris's
style
was
wholly
without
ornament
but
enviably
compact
lucid
and
strong
but
after
all
calder
was
the
gem
he
never
spoke
when
sober
he
spoke
continuously
when
he
wasn't
and
certainly
they
were
the
drunkest
speeches
that
a
man
ever
uttered
they
were
full
of
good
things
but
so
incredibly
mixed
up
and
wandering
that
it
made
one's
head
swim
to
follow
him
they
were
not
intended
to
be
funny
but
they
were
funny
for
the
very
gravity
which
the
speaker
put
into
his
flowing
miracles
of
incongruity
in
the
course
of
five
years
i
came
to
know
the
styles
of
the
five
orators
as
well
as
i
knew
the
style
of
any
speaker
in
my
own
club
at
home
these
reports
came
every
month
they
were
written
on
foolscap
600
words
to
the
page
and
usually
about
twenty
five
pages
in
a
report
a
good
15
000
words
i
should
say
a
solid
week's
work
the
reports
were
absorbingly
entertaining
long
as
they
were
but
unfortunately
for
me
they
did
not
come
alone
they
were
always
accompanied
by
a
lot
of
questions
about
passages
and
purposes
in
my
books
which
the
club
wanted
answered
and
additionally
accompanied
every
quarter
by
the
treasurer's
report
and
the
auditor's
report
and
the
committee's
report
and
the
president's
review
and
my
opinion
of
these
was
always
desired
also
suggestions
for
the
good
of
the
club
if
any
occurred
to
me
by
and
by
i
came
to
dread
those
things
and
this
dread
grew
and
grew
and
grew
grew
until
i
got
to
anticipating
them
with
a
cold
horror
for
i
was
an
indolent
man
and
not
fond
of
letter
writing
and
whenever
these
things
came
i
had
to
put
everything
by
and
sit
down
for
my
own
peace
of
mind
and
dig
and
dig
until
i
got
something
out
of
my
head
which
would
answer
for
a
reply
i
got
along
fairly
well
the
first
year
but
for
the
succeeding
four
years
the
mark
twain
club
of
corrigan
castle
was
my
curse
my
nightmare
the
grief
and
misery
of
my
life
and
i
got
so
so
sick
of
sitting
for
photographs
i
sat
every
year
for
five
years
trying
to
satisfy
that
insatiable
organization
then
at
last
i
rose
in
revolt
i
could
endure
my
oppressions
no
longer
i
pulled
my
fortitude
together
and
tore
off
my
chains
and
was
a
free
man
again
and
happy
from
that
day
i
burned
the
secretary's
fat
envelopes
the
moment
they
arrived
and
by
and
by
they
ceased
to
come
well
in
the
sociable
frankness
of
that
night
in
bendigo
i
brought
this
all
out
in
full
confession
then
mr
blank
came
out
in
the
same
frank
way
and
with
a
preliminary
word
of
gentle
apology
said
that
he
was
the
mark
twain
club
and
the
only
member
it
had
ever
had!
why
it
was
matter
for
anger
but
i
didn't
feel
any
he
said
he
never
had
to
work
for
a
living
and
that
by
the
time
he
was
thirty
life
had
become
a
bore
and
a
weariness
to
him
he
had
no
interests
left
they
had
paled
and
perished
one
by
one
and
left
him
desolate
he
had
begun
to
think
of
suicide
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
thought
of
that
happy
idea
of
starting
an
imaginary
club
and
went
straightway
to
work
at
it
with
enthusiasm
and
love
he
was
charmed
with
it
it
gave
him
something
to
do
it
elaborated
itself
on
his
hands
it
became
twenty
times
more
complex
and
formidable
than
was
his
first
rude
draft
of
it
every
new
addition
to
his
original
plan
which
cropped
up
in
his
mind
gave
him
a
fresh
interest
and
a
new
pleasure
he
designed
the
club
badge
himself
and
worked
over
it
altering
and
improving
it
a
number
of
days
and
nights
then
sent
to
london
and
had
it
made
it
was
the
only
one
that
was
made
it
was
made
for
me
the
rest
of
the
club
went
without
he
invented
the
thirty
two
members
and
their
names
he
invented
the
five
favorite
speakers
and
their
five
separate
styles
he
invented
their
speeches
and
reported
them
himself
he
would
have
kept
that
club
going
until
now
if
i
hadn't
deserted
he
said
he
said
he
worked
like
a
slave
over
those
reports
each
of
them
cost
him
from
a
week
to
a
fortnight's
work
and
the
work
gave
him
pleasure
and
kept
him
alive
and
willing
to
be
alive
it
was
a
bitter
blow
to
him
when
the
club
died
finally
there
wasn't
any
corrigan
castle
he
had
invented
that
too
it
was
wonderful
the
whole
thing
and
altogether
the
most
ingenious
and
laborious
and
cheerful
and
painstaking
practical
joke
i
have
ever
heard
of
and
i
liked
it
liked
to
bear
him
tell
about
it
yet
i
have
been
a
hater
of
practical
jokes
from
as
long
back
as
i
can
remember
finally
he
said
do
you
remember
a
note
from
melbourne
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
ago
telling
about
your
lecture
tour
in
australia
and
your
death
and
burial
in
melbourne
a
note
from
henry
bascomb
of
bascomb
hall
upper
holywell
hants
yes
i
wrote
it
m
y
word!
yes
i
did
it
i
don't
know
why
i
just
took
the
notion
and
carried
it
out
without
stopping
to
think
it
was
wrong
it
could
have
done
harm
i
was
always
sorry
about
it
afterward
you
must
forgive
me
i
was
mr
bascom's
guest
on
his
yacht
on
his
voyage
around
the
world
he
often
spoke
of
you
and
of
the
pleasant
times
you
had
had
together
in
his
home
and
the
notion
took
me
there
in
melbourne
and
i
imitated
his
hand
and
wrote
the
letter
so
the
mystery
was
cleared
up
after
so
many
many
years
chapter
xxvi
there
are
people
who
can
do
all
fine
and
heroic
things
but
one!
keep
from
telling
their
happinesses
to
the
unhappy
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
after
visits
to
maryborough
and
some
other
australian
towns
we
presently
took
passage
for
new
zealand
if
it
would
not
look
too
much
like
showing
off
i
would
tell
the
reader
where
new
zealand
is
for
he
is
as
i
was
he
thinks
he
knows
and
he
thinks
he
knows
where
hertzegovina
is
and
how
to
pronounce
pariah
and
how
to
use
the
word
unique
without
exposing
himself
to
the
derision
of
the
dictionary
but
in
truth
he
knows
none
of
these
things
there
are
but
four
or
five
people
in
the
world
who
possess
this
knowledge
and
these
make
their
living
out
of
it
they
travel
from
place
to
place
visiting
literary
assemblages
geographical
societies
and
seats
of
learning
and
springing
sudden
bets
that
these
people
do
not
know
these
things
since
all
people
think
they
know
them
they
are
an
easy
prey
to
these
adventurers
or
rather
they
were
an
easy
prey
until
the
law
interfered
three
months
ago
and
a
new
york
court
decided
that
this
kind
of
gambling
is
illegal
because
it
traverses
article
iv
section
9
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
forbids
betting
on
a
sure
thing
this
decision
was
rendered
by
the
full
bench
of
the
new
york
supreme
court
after
a
test
sprung
upon
the
court
by
counsel
for
the
prosecution
which
showed
that
none
of
the
nine
judges
was
able
to
answer
any
of
the
four
questions
all
people
think
that
new
zealand
is
close
to
australia
or
asia
or
somewhere
and
that
you
cross
to
it
on
a
bridge
but
that
is
not
so
it
is
not
close
to
anything
but
lies
by
itself
out
in
the
water
it
is
nearest
to
australia
but
still
not
near
the
gap
between
is
very
wide
it
will
be
a
surprise
to
the
reader
as
it
was
to
me
to
learn
that
the
distance
from
australia
to
new
zealand
is
really
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
miles
and
that
there
is
no
bridge
i
learned
this
from
professor
x
of
yale
university
whom
i
met
in
the
steamer
on
the
great
lakes
when
i
was
crossing
the
continent
to
sail
across
the
pacific
i
asked
him
about
new
zealand
in
order
to
make
conversation
i
supposed
he
would
generalize
a
little
without
compromising
himself
and
then
turn
the
subject
to
something
he
was
acquainted
with
and
my
object
would
then
be
attained
the
ice
would
be
broken
and
we
could
go
smoothly
on
and
get
acquainted
and
have
a
pleasant
time
but
to
my
surprise
he
was
not
only
not
embarrassed
by
my
question
but
seemed
to
welcome
it
and
to
take
a
distinct
interest
in
it
he
began
to
talk
fluently
confidently
comfortably
and
as
he
talked
my
admiration
grew
and
grew
for
as
the
subject
developed
under
his
hands
i
saw
that
he
not
only
knew
where
new
zealand
was
but
that
he
was
minutely
familiar
with
every
detail
of
its
history
politics
religions
and
commerce
its
fauna
flora
geology
products
and
climatic
peculiarities
when
he
was
done
i
was
lost
in
wonder
and
admiration
and
said
to
myself
he
knows
everything
in
the
domain
of
human
knowledge
he
is
king
i
wanted
to
see
him
do
more
miracles
and
so
just
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
him
answer
i
asked
him
about
hertzegovina
and
pariah
and
unique
but
he
began
to
generalize
then
and
show
distress
i
saw
that
with
new
zealand
gone
he
was
a
samson
shorn
of
his
locks
he
was
as
other
men
this
was
a
curious
and
interesting
mystery
and
i
was
frank
with
him
and
asked
him
to
explain
it
he
tried
to
avoid
it
at
first
but
then
laughed
and
said
that
after
all
the
matter
was
not
worth
concealment
so
he
would
let
me
into
the
secret
in
substance
this
is
his
story
last
autumn
i
was
at
work
one
morning
at
home
when
a
card
came
up
the
card
of
a
stranger
under
the
name
was
printed
a
line
which
showed
that
this
visitor
was
professor
of
theological
engineering
in
wellington
university
new
zealand
i
was
troubled
troubled
i
mean
by
the
shortness
of
the
notice
college
etiquette
required
that
he
be
at
once
invited
to
dinner
by
some
member
of
the
faculty
invited
to
dine
on
that
day
not
put
off
till
a
subsequent
day
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
college
etiquette
requires
in
the
case
of
a
foreign
guest
that
the
dinner
talk
shall
begin
with
complimentary
references
to
his
country
its
great
men
its
services
to
civilization
its
seats
of
learning
and
things
like
that
and
of
course
the
host
is
responsible
and
must
either
begin
this
talk
himself
or
see
that
it
is
done
by
some
one
else
i
was
in
great
difficulty
and
the
more
i
searched
my
memory
the
more
my
trouble
grew
i
found
that
i
knew
nothing
about
new
zealand
i
thought
i
knew
where
it
was
and
that
was
all
i
had
an
impression
that
it
was
close
to
australia
or
asia
or
somewhere
and
that
one
went
over
to
it
on
a
bridge
this
might
turn
out
to
be
incorrect
and
even
if
correct
it
would
not
furnish
matter
enough
for
the
purpose
at
the
dinner
and
i
should
expose
my
college
to
shame
before
my
guest
he
would
see
that
i
a
member
of
the
faculty
of
the
first
university
in
america
was
wholly
ignorant
of
his
country
and
he
would
go
away
and
tell
this
and
laugh
at
it
the
thought
of
it
made
my
face
burn
i
sent
for
my
wife
and
told
her
how
i
was
situated
and
asked
for
her
help
and
she
thought
of
a
thing
which
i
might
have
thought
of
myself
if
i
had
not
been
excited
and
worried
she
said
she
would
go
and
tell
the
visitor
that
i
was
out
but
would
be
in
in
a
few
minutes
and
she
would
talk
and
keep
him
busy
while
i
got
out
the
back
way
and
hurried
over
and
make
professor
lawson
give
the
dinner
for
lawson
knew
everything
and
could
meet
the
guest
in
a
creditable
way
and
save
the
reputation
of
the
university
i
ran
to
lawson
but
was
disappointed
he
did
not
know
anything
about
new
zealand
he
said
that
as
far
as
his
recollection
went
it
was
close
to
australia
or
asia
or
somewhere
and
you
go
over
to
it
on
a
bridge
but
that
was
all
he
knew
it
was
too
bad
lawson
was
a
perfect
encyclopedia
of
abstruse
learning
but
now
in
this
hour
of
our
need
it
turned
out
that
he
did
not
know
any
useful
thing
we
consulted
he
saw
that
the
reputation
of
the
university
was
in
very
real
peril
and
he
walked
the
floor
in
anxiety
talking
and
trying
to
think
out
some
way
to
meet
the
difficulty
presently
he
decided
that
we
must
try
the
rest
of
the
faculty
some
of
them
might
know
about
new
zealand
so
we
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
the
professor
of
astronomy
and
asked
him
and
he
said
that
all
he
knew
was
that
it
was
close
to
australia
or
asia
or
somewhere
and
you
went
over
to
it
on
we
shut
him
off
and
called
up
the
professor
of
biology
and
he
said
that
all
he
knew
was
that
it
was
close
to
aus
we
shut
him
off
and
sat
down
worried
and
disheartened
to
see
if
we
could
think
up
some
other
scheme
we
shortly
hit
upon
one
which
promised
well
and
this
one
we
adopted
and
set
its
machinery
going
at
once
it
was
this
lawson
must
give
the
dinner
the
faculty
must
be
notified
by
telephone
to
prepare
we
must
all
get
to
work
diligently
and
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
and
a
half
we
must
come
to
dinner
acquainted
with
new
zealand
at
least
well
enough
informed
to
appear
without
discredit
before
this
native
to
seem
properly
intelligent
we
should
have
to
know
about
new
zealand's
population
and
politics
and
form
of
government
and
commerce
and
taxes
and
products
and
ancient
history
and
modern
history
and
varieties
of
religion
and
nature
of
the
laws
and
their
codification
and
amount
of
revenue
and
whence
drawn
and
methods
of
collection
and
percentage
of
loss
and
character
of
climate
and
well
a
lot
of
things
like
that
we
must
suck
the
maps
and
cyclopedias
dry
and
while
we
posted
up
in
this
way
the
faculty's
wives
must
flock
over
one
after
the
other
in
a
studiedly
casual
way
and
help
my
wife
keep
the
new
zealander
quiet
and
not
let
him
get
out
and
come
interfering
with
our
studies
the
scheme
worked
admirably
but
it
stopped
business
stopped
it
entirely
it
is
in
the
official
log
book
of
yale
to
be
read
and
wondered
at
by
future
generations
the
account
of
the
great
blank
day
the
memorable
blank
day
the
day
wherein
the
wheels
of
culture
were
stopped
a
sunday
silence
prevailed
all
about
and
the
whole
university
stood
still
while
the
faculty
read
up
and
qualified
itself
to
sit
at
meat
without
shame
in
the
presence
of
the
professor
of
theological
engineering
from
new
zealand
when
we
assembled
at
the
dinner
we
were
miserably
tired
and
worn
but
we
were
posted
yes
it
is
fair
to
claim
that
in
fact
erudition
is
a
pale
name
for
it
new
zealand
was
the
only
subject
and
it
was
just
beautiful
to
hear
us
ripple
it
out
and
with
such
an
air
of
unembarrassed
ease
and
unostentatious
familiarity
with
detail
and
trained
and
seasoned
mastery
of
the
subject
and
oh
the
grace
and
fluency
of
it!
well
finally
somebody
happened
to
notice
that
the
guest
was
looking
dazed
and
wasn't
saying
anything
so
they
stirred
him
up
of
course
then
that
man
came
out
with
a
good
honest
eloquent
compliment
that
made
the
faculty
blush
he
said
he
was
not
worthy
to
sit
in
the
company
of
men
like
these
that
he
had
been
silent
from
admiration
that
he
had
been
silent
from
another
cause
also
silent
from
shame
silent
from
ignorance!
'for
'
said
he
'i
who
have
lived
eighteen
years
in
new
zealand
and
have
served
five
in
a
professorship
and
ought
to
know
much
about
that
country
perceive
now
that
i
know
almost
nothing
about
it
i
say
it
with
shame
that
i
have
learned
fifty
times
yes
a
hundred
times
more
about
new
zealand
in
these
two
hours
at
this
table
than
i
ever
knew
before
in
all
the
eighteen
years
put
together
i
was
silent
because
i
could
not
help
myself
what
i
knew
about
taxes
and
policies
and
laws
and
revenue
and
products
and
history
and
all
that
multitude
of
things
was
but
general
and
ordinary
and
vague
unscientific
in
a
word
and
it
would
have
been
insanity
to
expose
it
here
to
the
searching
glare
of
your
amazingly
accurate
and
all
comprehensive
knowledge
of
those
matters
gentlemen
i
beg
you
to
let
me
sit
silent
as
becomes
me
but
do
not
change
the
subject
i
can
at
least
follow
you
in
this
one
whereas
if
you
change
to
one
which
shall
call
out
the
full
strength
of
your
mighty
erudition
i
shall
be
as
one
lost
if
you
know
all
this
about
a
remote
little
inconsequent
patch
like
new
zealand
ah
what
wouldn't
you
know
about
any
other
subject!'

a
fine
day
a
brilliant
sun
warm
in
the

cold
in
the

an
icy
breeze
blowing
out
of
the
south
a
solemn
long
swell
rolling
up
northward
it
comes
from
the
south
pole
with
nothing
in
the
way
to
obstruct
its
march
and
tone
its
energy
down
i
have
read
somewhere
that
an
acute
observer
among
the

explorers
cook
or
tasman
accepted
this
majestic
swell
as
trustworthy
circumstantial
evidence
that
no
important
land
lay
to
the
southward
and
so
did
not
waste
time
on
a
useless
quest
in
that
direction
but
changed
his
course
and
went
searching
elsewhere
afternoon
passing
between
tasmania
formerly
van
diemen's
land
and
neighboring
islands
islands
whence
the
poor
exiled
tasmanian
savages
used
to
gaze
at
their
lost
homeland
and
cry
and
die
of
broken
hearts
how
glad
i
am
that
all
these
native
races
are
dead
and
gone
or
nearly
so
the
work
was
mercifully
swift
and
horrible
in
some
portions
of
australia
as
far
as
tasmania
is
concerned
the
extermination
was
complete
not
a
native
is
left
it
was
a
strife
of
years
and
decades
of
years
the
whites
and
the
blacks
hunted
each
other
ambushed
each
other
butchered
each
other
the
blacks
were
not
numerous
but
they
were
wary
alert
cunning
and
they
knew
their
country
well
they
lasted
a
long
time
few
as
they
were
and
inflicted
much
slaughter
upon
the
whites
the
government
wanted
to
save
the
blacks
from
ultimate
extermination
if
possible
one
of
its
schemes
was
to
capture
them
and
coop
them
up
on
a
neighboring
island
under
guard
bodies
of
whites
volunteered
for
the
hunt
for
the
pay
was
good
l5
for
each
black
captured
and
delivered
but
the
success
achieved
was
not
very
satisfactory
the
black
was
naked
and
his
body
was
greased
it
was
hard
to
get
a
grip
on
him
that
would
hold
the
whites
moved
about
in
armed
bodies
and
surprised
little
families
of
natives
and
did
make
captures
but
it
was
suspected
that
in
these
surprises
half
a
dozen
natives
were
killed
to
one
caught
and
that
was
not
what
the
government
desired
another
scheme
was
to
drive
the
natives
into
a
corner
of
the
island
and
fence
them
in
by
a
cordon
of
men
placed
in
line
across
the
country
but
the
natives
managed
to
slip
through
constantly
and
continue
their
murders
and
arsons
the
governor
warned
these
unlettered
savages
by
printed
proclamation
that
they
must
stay
in
the
desolate
region
officially
appointed
for
them!
the
proclamation
was
a
dead
letter
the
savages
could
not
read
it
afterward
a
picture
proclamation
was
issued
it
was
painted
up
on
boards
and
these
were
nailed
to
trees
in
the
forest
herewith
is
a
photographic
reproduction
of
this
fashion
plate
substantially
it
means
1

governor
wishes
the
whites
and
the
blacks
to
love

whites
who

will

upon
its
several
schemes
the
government
spent
l30
000
and
employed
the
labors
and
ingenuities
of
several
thousand
whites
for
a
long
time
with
failure
as
a
result
then
at
last
a
quarter
of
a
century
after
the
beginning
of
the
troubles
between
the
two
races
the
right
man
was
found
no
he
found
himself
this
was
george
augustus
robinson
called
in
history
the
conciliator
he
was
not
educated
and
not
conspicuous
in
any
way
he
was
a
working
bricklayer
in
hobart
town
but
he
must
have
been
an
amazing
personality
a
man
worth
traveling
far
to
see
it
may
be
his
counterpart
appears
in
history
but
i
do
not
know
where
to
look
for
it
he
set
himself
this
incredible
task
to
go
out
into
the
wilderness
the
jungle
and
the
mountain
retreats
where
the
hunted
and
implacable
savages
were
hidden
and
appear
among
them
unarmed
speak
the
language
of
love
and
of
kindness
to
them
and
persuade
them
to
forsake
their
homes
and
the
wild
free
life
that
was
so
dear
to
them
and
go
with
him
and
surrender
to
the
hated
whites
and
live
under
their
watch
and
ward
and
upon
their
charity
the
rest
of
their
lives!
on
its
face
it
was
the
dream
of
a
madman
in
the
beginning
his
moral
suasion
project
was
sarcastically
dubbed
the
sugar
plum
speculation
if
the
scheme
was
striking
and
new
to
the
world's
experience
the
situation
was
not
less
so
it
was
this
the
white
population
numbered
40
000
in
1831
the
black
population
numbered
three
hundred
not
300
warriors
but
300
men
women
and
children
the
whites
were
armed
with
guns
the
blacks
with
clubs
and
spears
the
whites
had
fought
the
blacks
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
had
tried
every
thinkable
way
to
capture
kill
or
subdue
them
and
could
not
do
it
if
white
men
of
any
race
could
have
done
it
these
would
have
accomplished
it
but
every
scheme
had
failed
the
splendid
300
the
matchless
300
were
unconquered
and
manifestly
unconquerable
they
would
not
yield
they
would
listen
to
no
terms
they
would
fight
to
the
bitter
end
yet
they
had
no
poet
to
keep
up
their
heart
and
sing
the
marvel
of
their
magnificent
patriotism
at
the
end
of
five
and
twenty
years
of
hard
fighting
the
surviving
300
naked
patriots
were
still
defiant
still
persistent
still
efficacious
with
their
rude
weapons
and
the
governor
and
the
40
000
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
nor
what
to
do
then
the
bricklayer
that
wonderful
man
proposed
to
go
out
into
the
wilderness
with
no
weapon
but
his
tongue
and
no
protection
but
his
honest
eye
and
his
humane
heart
and
track
those
embittered
savages
to
their
lairs
in
the
gloomy
forests
and
among
the
mountain
snows
naturally
he
was
considered
a
crank
but
he
was
not
quite
that
in
fact
he
was
a
good
way
short
of
that
he
was
building
upon
his
long
and
intimate
knowledge
of
the
native
character
the
deriders
of
his
project
were
right
from
their
standpoint
for
they
believed
the
natives
to
be
mere
wild
beasts
and
robinson
was
right
from
his
standpoint
for
he
believed
the
natives
to
be
human
beings
the
truth
did
really
lie
between
the
two
the
event
proved
that
robinson's
judgment
was
soundest
but
about
once
a
month
for
four
years
the
event
came
near
to
giving
the
verdict
to
the
deriders
for
about
that
frequently
robinson
barely
escaped
falling
under
the
native
spears
but
history
shows
that
he
had
a
thinking
head
and
was
not
a
mere
wild
sentimentalist
for
instance
he
wanted
the
war
parties
called
in
before
he
started
unarmed
upon
his
mission
of
peace
he
wanted
the
best
chance
of
success
not
a
half
chance
and
he
was
very
willing
to
have
help
and
so
high
rewards
were
advertised
for
any
who
would
go
unarmed
with
him
this
opportunity
was
declined
robinson
persuaded
some
tamed
natives
of
both
sexes
to
go
with
him
a
strong
evidence
of
his
persuasive
powers
for
those
natives
well
knew
that
their
destruction
would
be
almost
certain
as
it
turned
out
they
had
to
face
death
over
and
over
again
robinson
and
his
little
party
had
a
difficult
undertaking
upon
their
hands
they
could
not
ride
off
horseback
comfortably
into
the
woods
and
call
leonidas
and
his
300
together
for
a
talk
and
a
treaty
the
following
day
for
the
wild
men
were
not
in
a
body
they
were
scattered
immense
distances
apart
over
regions
so
desolate
that
even
the
birds
could
not
make
a
living
with
the
chances
offered
scattered
in
groups
of
twenty
a
dozen
half
a
dozen
even
in
groups
of
three
and
the
mission
must
go
on
foot
mr
bonwick
furnishes
a
description
of
those
horrible
regions
whereby
it
will
be
seen
that
even
fugitive
gangs
of
the
hardiest
and
choicest
human
devils
the
world
has
seen
the
convicts
set
apart
to
people
the
hell
of
macquarrie
harbor
station
were
never
able
but
once
to
survive
the
horrors
of
a
march
through
them
but
starving
and
struggling
and
fainting
and
failing
ate
each
other
and
died
onward
still
onward
was
the
order
of
the
indomitable
robinson
no
one
ignorant
of
the
western
country
of
tasmania
can
form
a
correct
idea
of
the
traveling
difficulties
while
i
was
resident
in
hobart
town
the
governor
sir
john
franklin
and
his
lady
undertook
the
western
journey
to
macquarrie
harbor
and
suffered
terribly
one
man
who
assisted
to
carry
her
ladyship
through
the
swamps
gave
me
his
bitter
experience
of
its
miseries
several
were
disabled
for
life
no
wonder
that
but
one
party
escaping
from
macquarrie
harbor
convict
settlement
arrived
at
the
civilized
region
in
safety
men
perished
in
the
scrub
were
lost
in
snow
or
were
devoured
by
their
companions
this
was
the
territory
traversed
by
mr
robinson
and
his
black
guides
all
honor
to
his
intrepidity
and
their
wonderful
fidelity!
when
they
had
in
the
depth
of
winter
to
cross
deep
and
rapid
rivers
pass
among
mountains
six
thousand
feet
high
pierce
dangerous
thickets
and
find
food
in
a
country
forsaken
even
by
birds
we
can
realize
their
hardships
after
a
frightful
journey
by
cradle
mountain
and
over
the
lofty
plateau
of
middlesex
plains
the
travelers
experienced
unwonted
misery
and
the
circumstances
called
forth
the
best
qualities
of
the
noble
little
band
mr
robinson
wrote
afterwards
to
mr
secretary
burnett
some
details
of
this
passage
of
horrors
in
that
letter
of
oct
2
1834
he
states
that
his
natives
were
very
reluctant
to
go
over
the
dreadful
mountain
passes
that
'for
seven
successive
days
we
continued
traveling
over
one
solid
body
of
snow
'
that
'the
snows
were
of
incredible
depth
'
that
'the
natives
were
frequently
up
to
their
middle
in
snow
'
but
still
the
ill
clad
ill
fed
diseased
and
way
worn
men
and
women
were
sustained
by
the
cheerful
voice
of
their
unconquerable
friend
and
responded
most
nobly
to
his
call
mr
bonwick
says
that
robinson's
friendly
capture
of
the
big
river
tribe
remember
it
was
a
whole
tribe
was
by
far
the
grandest
feature
of
the
war
and
the
crowning
glory
of
his
efforts
the
word
war
was
not
well
chosen
and
is
misleading
there
was
war
still
but
only
the
blacks
were
conducting
it
the
whites
were
holding
off
until
robinson
could
give
his
scheme
a
fair
trial
i
think
that
we
are
to
understand
that
the
friendly
capture
of
that
tribe
was
by
far
the
most
important
thing
the
highest
in
value
that
happened
during
the
whole
thirty
years
of
truceless
hostilities
that
it
was
a
decisive
thing
a
peaceful
waterloo
the
surrender
of
the
native
napoleon
and
his
dreaded
forces
the
happy
ending
of
the
long
strife
for
that
tribe
was
the
terror
of
the
colony
its
chief
the
black
douglas
of
bush
households
robinson
knew
that
these
formidable
people
were
lurking
somewhere
in
some
remote
corner
of
the
hideous
regions
just
described
and
he
and
his
unarmed
little
party
started
on
a
tedious
and
perilous
hunt
for
them
at
last
there
under
the
shadows
of
the
frenchman's
cap
whose
grim
cone
rose
five
thousand
feet
in
the
uninhabited
westward
interior
they
were
found
it
was
a
serious
moment
robinson
himself
believed
for
once
that
his
mission
successful
until
now
was
to
end
here
in
failure
and
that
his
own
death
hour
had
struck
the
redoubtable
chief
stood
in
menacing
attitude
with
his
eighteen
foot
spear
poised
his
warriors
stood
massed
at
his
back
armed
for
battle
their
faces
eloquent
with
their
long
cherished
loathing
for
white
men
they
rattled
their
spears
and
shouted
their
war
cry
their
women
were
back
of
them
laden
with
supplies
of
weapons
and
keeping
their
150
eager
dogs
quiet
until
the
chief
should
give
the
signal
to
fall
on
i
think
we
shall
soon
be
in
the
resurrection
whispered
a
member
of
robinson's
little
party
i
think
we
shall
answered
robinson
then
plucked
up
heart
and
began
his
persuasions
in
the
tribe's
own
dialect
which
surprised
and
pleased
the
chief
presently
there
was
an
interruption
by
the
chief
who
are
you
we
are
gentlemen
where
are
your
guns
we
have
none
the
warrior
was
astonished
where
your
little
guns
pistols
we
have
none
a
few
minutes
passed
in
by
play
suspense
discussion
among
the
tribesmen
robinson's
tamed
squaws
ventured
to
cross
the
line
and
begin
persuasions
upon
the
wild
squaws
then
the
chief
stepped
back
to
confer
with
the
old
women
the
real
arbiters
of
savage
war
mr
bonwick
continues
as
the
fallen
gladiator
in
the
arena
looks
for
the
signal
of
life
or
death
from
the
president
of
the
amphitheatre
so
waited
our
friends
in
anxious
suspense
while
the
conference
continued
in
a
few
minutes
before
a
word
was
uttered
the
women
of
the
tribe
threw
up
their
arms
three
times
this
was
the
inviolable
sign
of
peace!
down
fell
the
spears
forward
with
a
heavy
sigh
of
relief
and
upward
glance
of
gratitude
came
the
friends
of
peace
the
impulsive
natives
rushed
forth
with
tears
and
cries
as
each
saw
in
the
other's
rank
a
loved
one
of
the
past
it
was
a
jubilee
of
joy
a
festival
followed
and
while
tears
flowed
at
the
recital
of
woe
a
corrobory
of
pleasant
laughter
closed
the
eventful
day
in
four
years
without
the
spilling
of
a
drop
of
blood
robinson
brought
them
all
in
willing
captives
and
delivered
them
to
the
white
governor
and
ended
the
war
which
powder
and
bullets
and
thousands
of
men
to
use
them
had
prosecuted
without
result
since
1804
marsyas
charming
the
wild

with
his
music
that
is
fable
but
the
miracle
wrought
by
robinson
is
fact
it
is
history
and
authentic
and
surely
there
is
nothing
greater
nothing
more
reverence
compelling
in
the
history
of
any
country
ancient
or
modern
and
in
memory
of
the
greatest
man
australasia
ever
developed
or
ever
will
develop
there
is
a
stately
monument
to
george
augustus
robinson
the
conciliator
in
no
it
is
to
another
man
i
forget
his
name
however
robertson's
own
generation
honored
him
and
in
manifesting
it
honored
themselves
the
government
gave
him
a
money
reward
and
a
thousand
acres
of
land
and
the
people
held
mass
meetings
and
praised
him
and
emphasized
their
praise
with
a
large
subscription
of
money
a
good
dramatic
situation
but
the
curtain
fell
on
another
when
this
desperate
tribe
was
thus
captured
there
was
much
surprise
to
find
that
the
l30
000
of
a
little
earlier
day
had
been
spent
and
the
whole
population
of
the
colony
placed
under
arms
in
contention
with
an
opposing
force
of
sixteen
men
with
wooden
spears!
yet
such
was
the
fact
the
celebrated
big
river
tribe
that
had
been
raised
by
european
fears
to
a
host
consisted
of
sixteen
men
nine
women
and
one
child
with
a
knowledge
of
the
mischief
done
by
these
few
their
wonderful
marches
and
their
widespread
aggressions
their
enemies
cannot
deny
to
them
the
attributes
of
courage
and
military
tact
a
wallace
might
harass
a
large
army
with
a
small
and
determined
band
but
the
contending
parties
were
at
least
equal
in
arms
and
civilization
the
zulus
who
fought
us
in
africa
the
maories
in
new
zealand
the
arabs
in
the
soudan
were
far
better
provided
with
weapons
more
advanced
in
the
science
of
war
and
considerably
more
numerous
than
the
naked
tasmanians
governor
arthur
rightly
termed
them
a
noble
race
these
were
indeed
wonderful
people
the
natives
they
ought
not
to
have
been
wasted
they
should
have
been
crossed
with
the
whites
it
would
have
improved
the
whites
and
done
the
natives
no
harm
but
the
natives
were
wasted
poor
heroic
wild
creatures
they
were
gathered
together
in
little
settlements
on
neighboring
islands
and
paternally
cared
for
by
the
government
and
instructed
in
religion
and
deprived
of
tobacco
because
the
superintendent
of
the
sunday
school
was
not
a
smoker
and
so
considered
smoking
immoral
the
natives
were
not
used
to
clothes
and
houses
and
regular
hours
and
church
and
school
and
sunday
school
and
work
and
the
other
misplaced
persecutions
of
civilization
and
they
pined
for
their
lost
home
and
their
wild
free
life
too
late
they
repented
that
they
had
traded
that
heaven
for
this
hell
they
sat
homesick
on
their
alien
crags
and
day
by
day
gazed
out
through
their
tears
over
the
sea
with
unappeasable
longing
toward
the
hazy
bulk
which
was
the
specter
of
what
had
been
their
paradise
one
by
one
their
hearts
broke
and
they
died
in
a
very
few
years
nothing
but
a
scant
remnant
remained
alive
a
handful
lingered
along
into
age
in
1864
the
last
man
died
in
1876
the
last
woman
died
and
the
spartans
of
australasia
were
extinct
the
whites
always
mean
well
when
they
take
human
fish
out
of
the
ocean
and
try
to
make
them
dry
and
warm
and
happy
and
comfortable
in
a
chicken
coop
but
the
kindest
hearted
white
man
can
always
be
depended
on
to
prove
himself
inadequate
when
he
deals
with
savages
he
cannot
turn
the
situation
around
and
imagine
how
he
would
like
it
to
have
a
well
meaning
savage
transfer
him
from
his
house
and
his
church
and
his
clothes
and
his
books
and
his
choice
food
to
a
hideous
wilderness
of
sand
and
rocks
and
snow
and
ice
and
sleet
and
storm
and
blistering
sun
with
no
shelter
no
bed
no
covering
for
his
and
his
family's
naked
bodies
and
nothing
to
eat
but
snakes
and
grubs
and
'offal
this
would
be
a
hell
to
him
and
if
he
had
any
wisdom
he
would
know
that
his
own
civilization
is
a
hell
to
the
savage
but
he
hasn't
any
and
has
never
had
any
and
for
lack
of
it
he
shut
up
those
poor
natives
in
the
unimaginable
perdition
of
his
civilization
committing
his
crime
with
the
very
best
intentions
and
saw
those
poor
creatures
waste
away
under
his
tortures
and
gazed
at
it
vaguely
troubled
and
sorrowful
and
wondered
what
could
be
the
matter
with
them
one
is
almost
betrayed
into
respecting
those
criminals
they
were
so
sincerely
kind
and
tender
and
humane
and
well
meaning
they
didn't
know
why
those
exiled
savages
faded
away
and
they
did
their
honest
best
to
reason
it
out
and
one
man
in
a
like
case
in
new
south
wales
did
reason
it
out
and
arrive
at
a
solution
it
is
from
the
wrath
of
god
which
is
revealed
from
heaven
against
cold
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of
men
that
settles
it

xxviii
let
us
be
thankful
for
the
fools
but
for
them
the
rest
of
us
could
not
succeed
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
the
aphorism
does
really
seem
true
given
the
circumstances
the
man
will
appear
but
the
man
musn't
appear
ahead
of
time
or
it
will
spoil
everything
in
robinson's
case
the
moment
had
been
approaching
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
meantime
the
future
conciliator
was
tranquilly
laying
bricks
in
hobart
when
all
other
means
had
failed
the
moment
had
arrived
and
the
bricklayer
put
down
his
trowel
and
came
forward
earlier
he
would
have
been
jeered
back
to
his
trowel
again
it
reminds
me
of
a
tale
that
was
told
me
by
a
kentuckian
on
the
train
when
we
were
crossing
montana
he
said
the
tale
was
current
in
louisville
years
ago
he
thought
it
had
been
in
print
but
could
not
remember
at
any
rate
in
substance
it
was
this
as
nearly
as
i
can
call
it
back
to
mind
a
few
years
before
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
it
began
to
appear
that
memphis
tennessee
was
going
to
be
a
great
tobacco
entrepot
the
wise
could
see
the
signs
of
it
at
that
time
memphis
had
a
wharf
boat
of
course
there
was
a
paved
sloping
wharf
for
the
accommodation
of
freight
but
the
steamers
landed
on
the
outside
of
the
wharfboat
and
all
loading
and
unloading
was
done
across
it
between
steamer
and
shore
a
number
of
wharfboat
clerks
were
needed
and
part
of
the
time
every
day
they
were
very
busy
and
part
of
the
time
tediously
idle
they
were
boiling
over
with
youth
and
spirits
and
they
had
to
make
the
intervals
of
idleness
endurable
in
some
way
and
as
a
rule
they
did
it
by
contriving
practical
jokes
and
playing
them
upon
each
other
the
favorite
butt
for
the
jokes
was
ed
jackson
because
he
played
none
himself
and
was
easy
game
for
other
people's
for
he
always
believed
whatever
was
told
him
one
day
he
told
the
others
his
scheme
for
his
holiday
he
was
not
going
fishing
or
hunting
this
time
no
he
had
thought
out
a
better
plan
out
of
his
$40
a
month
he
had
saved
enough
for
his
purpose
in
an
economical
way
and
he
was
going
to
have
a
look
at
new
york
it
was
a
great
and
surprising
idea
it
meant
travel
immense
travel
in
those
days
it
meant
seeing
the
world
it
was
the
equivalent
of
a
voyage
around
it
in
ours
at
first
the
other
youths
thought
his
mind
was
affected
but
when
they
found
that
he
was
in
earnest
the
next
thing
to
be
thought
of
was
what
sort
of
opportunity
this
venture
might
afford
for
a
practical
joke
the
young
men
studied
over
the
matter
then
held
a
secret
consultation
and
made
a
plan
the
idea
was
that
one
of
the
conspirators
should
offer
ed
a
letter
of
introduction
to
commodore
vanderbilt
and
trick
him
into
delivering
it
it
would
be
easy
to
do
this
but
what
would
ed
do
when
he
got
back
to
memphis
that
was
a
serious
matter
he
was
good
hearted
and
had
always
taken
the
jokes
patiently
but
they
had
been
jokes
which
did
not
humiliate
him
did
not
bring
him
to
shame
whereas
this
would
be
a
cruel
one
in
that
way
and
to
play
it
was
to
meddle
with
fire
for
with
all
his
good
nature
ed
was
a
southerner
and
the
english
of
that
was
that
when
he
came
back
he
would
kill
as
many
of
the
conspirators
as
he
could
before
falling
himself
however
the
chances
must
be
taken
it
wouldn't
do
to
waste
such
a
joke
as
that
so
the
letter
was
prepared
with
great
care
and
elaboration
it
was
signed
alfred
fairchild
and
was
written
in
an
easy
and
friendly
spirit
it
stated
that
the
bearer
was
the
bosom
friend
of
the
writer's
son
and
was
of
good
parts
and
sterling
character
and
it
begged
the
commodore
to
be
kind
to
the
young
stranger
for
the
writer's
sake
it
went
on
to
say
you
may
have
forgotten
me
in
this
long
stretch
of
time
but
you
will
easily
call
me
back
out
of
your
boyhood
memories
when
i
remind
you
of
how
we
robbed
old
stevenson's
orchard
that
night
and
how
while
he
was
chasing
down
the
road
after
us
we
cut
across
the
field
and
doubled
back
and
sold
his
own
apples
to
his
own
cook
for
a
hat
full
of
doughnuts
and
the
time
that
we
and
so
forth
and
so
on
bringing
in
names
of
imaginary
comrades
and
detailing
all
sorts
of
wild
and
absurd
and
of
course
wholly
imaginary
schoolboy
pranks
and
adventures
but
putting
them
into
lively
and
telling
shape
with
all
gravity
ed
was
asked
if
he
would
like
to
have
a
letter
to
commodore
vanderbilt
the
great
millionaire
it
was
expected
that
the
question
would
astonish
ed
and
it
did
what
do
you
know
that
extraordinary
man
no
but
my
father
does
they
were
schoolboys
together
and
if
you
like
i'll
write
and
ask
father
i
know
he'll
be
glad
to
give
it
to
you
for
my
sake
ed
could
not
find
words
capable
of
expressing
his
gratitude
and
delight
the
three
days
passed
and
the
letter
was
put
into
his
bands
he
started
on
his
trip
still
pouring
out
his
thanks
while
he
shook
good
bye
all
around
and
when
he
was
out
of
sight
his
comrades
let
fly
their
laughter
in
a
storm
of
happy
satisfaction
and
then
quieted
down
and
were
less
happy
less
satisfied
for
the
old
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
this
deception
began
to
intrude
again
arrived
in
new
york
ed
found
his
way
to
commodore
vanderbilt's
business
quarters
and
was
ushered
into
a
large
anteroom
where
a
score
of
people
were
patiently
awaiting
their
turn
for
a
two
minute
interview
with
the
millionaire
in
his
private
office
a
servant
asked
for
ed's
card
and
got
the
letter
instead
ed
was
sent
for
a
moment
later
and
found
mr
vanderbilt
alone
with
the
letter
open
in
his
hand
pray
sit
down
mr
er
jackson
ah
sit
down
mr
jackson
by
the
opening
sentences
it
seems
to
be
a
letter
from
an
old
friend
allow
me
i
will
run
my
eye
through
it
he
says
he
says
why
who
is
it
he
turned
the
sheet
and
found
the
signature
alfred
fairchild
hm
fairchild
i
don't
recall
the
name
but
that
is
nothing
a
thousand
names

gone
from
me

says

i
don't
quite

says

was
a
game!

endid!
how
it
carries
me
back!

all
dim
of
course
it's
a
long
time
ago
and
the
names
some
of
the
names
are
wavery
and
indistinct
but
sho'
i
know
it
happened

can
feel
it!
and
lord
how
it
warms
my
heart
and
brings
back
my
lost
youth!

you'll
give
him
my
gratitude
for
what
this
letter
has
done
for
the
tired
spirit
of
a
hard
worked
man
and
tell
him

care
of
you
my
boy
make
yourself
easy
as
to
that
ed
stayed
a
week
and
had
an
immense
time
and
never
suspected
that
the
commodore's
shrewd
eye
was
on
him
and
that
he
was
daily
being
weighed
and
measured
and
analyzed
and
tried
and
tested
yes
he
had
an
immense
time
and
never
wrote
home
but
saved
it
all
up
to
tell
when
he
should
get
back
twice
with
proper
modesty
and
decency
he
proposed
to
end
his
visit
but
the
commodore
said
no
wait
leave
it
to
me
i'll
tell
you
when
to
go
in
those
days
the
commodore
was
making
some
of
those
vast
combinations
of
his
consolidations
of
warring
odds
and
ends
of
railroads
into
harmonious
systems
and
concentrations
of
floating
and
rudderless
commerce
in
effective
centers
and
among
other
things
his
farseeing
eye
had
detected
the
convergence
of
that
huge
tobacco
commerce
already
spoken
of
toward
memphis
and
he
had
resolved
to
set
his
grasp
upon
it
and
make
it
his
own
the
week
came
to
an
end
then
the
commodore
said
now
you
can
start
home
but
first
we
will
have
some
more
talk
about
that
tobacco
matter
i
know
you
now
i
know
your
abilities
as
well
as
you
know
them
yourself
perhaps
better
you
understand
that
tobacco
matter
you
understand
that
i
am
going
to
take
possession
of
it
and
you
also
understand
the
plans
which
i
have
matured
for
doing
it
what
i
want
is
a
man
who
knows
my
mind
and
is
qualified
to
represent
me
in
memphis
and
be
in
supreme
command
of
that
important
business
and
i
appoint
you
me!
yes
your
salary
will
be
high
of
course
for
you
are
representing
me
later
you
will
earn
increases
of
it
and
will
get
them
you
will
need
a
small
army
of
assistants
choose
them
yourself
and
carefully
take
no
man
for
friendship's
sake
but
all
things
being
equal
take
the
man
you
know
take
your
friend
in
preference
to
the
stranger
after
some
further
talk
under
this
head
the
commodore
said
good
bye
my
boy
and
thank
alf
for
me
for
sending
you
to
me
when
ed
reached
memphis
he
rushed
down
to
the
wharf
in
a
fever
to
tell
his
great
news
and
thank
the
boys
over
and
over
again
for
thinking
to
give
him
the
letter
to
mr
vanderbilt
it
happened
to
be
one
of
those
idle
times
blazing
hot
noonday
and
no
sign
of
life
on
the
wharf
but
as
ed
threaded
his
way
among
the
freight
piles
he
saw
a
white
linen
figure
stretched
in
slumber
upon
a
pile
of
grain
sacks
under
an
awning
and
said
to
himself
that's
one
of
them
and
hastened
his
step
next
he
said
it's
charley
it's
fairchild
good
and
the
next
moment
laid
an
affectionate
hand
on
the
sleeper's
shoulder
the
eyes
opened
lazily
took
one
glance
the
face
blanched
the
form
whirled
itself
from
the
sack
pile
and
in
an
instant
ed
was
alone
and
fairchild
was
flying
for
the
wharf
boat
like
the
wind!
ed
was
dazed
stupefied
was
fairchild
crazy
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
this
he
started
slow
and
dreamily
down
toward
the
wharf
boat
turned
the
corner
of
a
freight
pile
and
came
suddenly
upon
two
of
the
boys
they
were
lightly
laughing
over
some
pleasant
matter
they
heard
his
step
and
glanced
up
just
as
he
discovered
them
the
laugh
died
abruptly
and
before
ed
could
speak
they
were
off
and
sailing
over
barrels
and
bales
like
hunted
deer
again
ed
was
paralyzed
had
the
boys
all
gone
mad
what
could
be
the
explanation
of
this
extraordinary
conduct
and
so
dreaming
along
he
reached
the
wharf
boat
and
stepped
aboard
nothing
but
silence
there
and
vacancy
he
crossed
the
deck
turned
the
corner
to
go
down
the
outer
guard
heard
a
fervent
o
lord!
and
saw
a
white
linen
form
plunge
overboard
the
youth
came
up
coughing
and
strangling
and
cried
out
go
'way
from
here!
you
let
me
alone
i
didn't
do
it
i
swear
i
didn't!
didn't
do
what
give
you
the
never
mind
what
you
didn't
do
come
out
of
that!
what
makes
you
all
act
so
what
have
i
done
you
why
you
haven't
done
anything
but
well
then
what
have
you
got
against
me
what
do
you
all
treat
me
so
for
i
er
but
haven't
you
got
anything
against
us
of
course
not
what
put
such
a
thing
into
your
head
honor
bright
you
haven't
honor
bright
swear
it!
i
don't
know
what
in
the
world
you
mean
but
i
swear
it
anyway
and
you'll
shake
hands
with
me
goodness
knows
i'll
be
glad
to!
why
i'm
just
starving
to
shake
hands
with
somebody!
the
swimmer
muttered
hang
him
he
smelt
a
rat
and
never
delivered
the
letter!
but
it's
all
right
i'm
not
going
to
fetch
up
the
subject
and
he
crawled
out
and
came
dripping
and
draining
to
shake
hands
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
conspirators
showed
up
cautiously
armed
to
the
teeth
took
in
the
amicable
situation
then
ventured
warily
forward
and
joined
the
love
feast
and
to
ed's
eager
inquiry
as
to
what
made
them
act
as
they
had
been
acting
they
answered
evasively
and
pretended
that
they
had
put
it
up
as
a
joke
to
see
what
he
would
do
it
was
the
best
explanation
they
could
invent
at
such
short
notice
and
each
said
to
himself
he
never
delivered
that
letter
and
the
joke
is
on
us
if
he
only
knew
it
or
we
were
dull
enough
to
come
out
and
tell
then
of
course
they
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
trip
and
he
said
come
right
up
on
the
boiler
deck
and
order
the
drinks
it's
my
treat
i'm
going
to
tell
you
all
about
it
and
to
night
it's
my
treat
again
and
we'll
have
oysters
and
a
time!
when
the
drinks
were
brought
and
cigars
lighted
ed
said
well
when
i
delivered
the
letter
to
mr
vanderbilt
great
scott!
gracious
how
you
scared
me
what's
the
matter
oh
er
nothing
nothing
it
was
a
tack
in
the
chair
seat
said
one
but
you
all
said
it
however
no
matter
when
i
delivered
the
letter
did
you
deliver
it
and
they
looked
at
each
other
as
people
might
who
thought
that
maybe
they
were
dreaming
then
they
settled
to
listening
and
as
the
story
deepened
and
its
marvels
grew
the
amazement
of
it
made
them
dumb
and
the
interest
of
it
took
their
breath
they
hardly
uttered
a
whisper
during
two
hours
but
sat
like
petrifactions
and
drank
in
the
immortal
romance
at
last
the
tale
was
ended
and
ed
said
and
it's
all
owing
to
you
boys
and
you'll
never
find
me
ungrateful
bless
your
hearts
the
best
friends
a
fellow
ever
had!
you'll
all
have
places
i
want
every
one
of
you
i
know
you
i
know
you
'by
the
back
'
as
the
gamblers
say
you're
jokers
and
all
that
but
you're
sterling
with
the
hallmark
on
and
charley
fairchild
you
shall
be
my
first
assistant
and
right
hand
because
of
your
first
class
ability
and
because
you
got
me
the
letter
and
for
your
father's
sake
who
wrote
it
for
me
and
to
please
mr
vanderbilt
who
said
it
would!
and
here's
to
that
great
man
drink
hearty!
yes
when
the
moment
comes
the
man
appears
even
if
he
is
a

away

convicts
to

to

freedom
after
escaping
from
macquarrie
harbor
and
the
gates
of
hell
in
the
early
days
tasmania
had
a
great
population
of
convicts
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
and
a
bitter
hard
life
they
had
in
one
spot
there
was
a
settlement
of
juvenile
convicts
children
who
had
been
sent

of
an
interesting
sort
the
historian
laurie
whose
book
the
story
of
australasia
is
just
out
invoices
its
features
with
considerable
truth
and
intemperance
the
marvelous
picturesqueness
of
every
point
of
view
combined
with
the
clear
balmy
atmosphere
and
the
transparency
of
the
ocean
depths
must
have
delighted
and
deeply
impressed
the
early
explorers
if
the
rock
bound
coasts
sullen
defiant
and
lowering
seemed
uninviting
these
were
occasionally
broken
into
charmingly
alluring
coves
floored
with
golden
sand
clad
with
evergreen
shrubbery
and
adorned
with
every
variety
of
indigenous
wattle
she
oak
wild
flower
and
fern
from
the
delicately
graceful
'maiden
hair'
to
the
palm
like
'old

the
majestic
gum
tree
clean
and
smooth
as
the
mast
of
'some
tall
admiral'
pierces
the
clear
air
to
the
height
of
230
feet
or
more
it
looked
so
to
me
coasting
along
tasman's
peninsula
what
a
shock
of
pleasant
wonder
must
have
struck
the
early
mariner
on
suddenly
sighting
cape
pillar
with
its
cluster
of
black
ribbed
basaltic
columns
rising
to
a
height
of
900
feet
the
hydra
head
wreathed
in
a
turban
of
fleecy
cloud
the
base
lashed
by
jealous
waves
spouting
angry
fountains
of
foam
that
is
well
enough
but
i
did
not
suppose
those
snags
were
900
feet
high
still
they
were
a
very
fine
show
they
stood
boldly
out
by
themselves
and
made
a
fascinatingly
odd
spectacle
but
there
was
nothing
about
their
appearance
to
suggest
the
heads
of
a
hydra
they
looked
like
a
row
of
lofty
slabs
with
their
upper
ends
tapered
to
the
shape
of
a
carving
knife
point
in
fact
the
early
voyager
ignorant
of
their
great
height
might
have
mistaken
them
for
a
rusty
old
rank
of
piles
that
had
sagged
this
way
and
that
out
of
the
perpendicular
the
peninsula
is
lofty
rocky
and
densely
clothed
with
scrub
or
brush
or
both
it
is
joined
to
the
main
by
a
low
neck
at
this
junction
was
formerly
a
convict
station
called
port
arthur
a
place
hard
to
escape
from
behind
it
was
the
wilderness
of
scrub
in
which
a
fugitive
would
soon
starve
in
front
was
the
narrow
neck
with
a
cordon
of
chained
dogs
across
it
and
a
line
of
lanterns
and
a
fence
of
living
guards
armed
we
saw
the
place
as
we
swept
by
that
is
we
had
a
glimpse
of
what
we
were
told
was
the
entrance
to
port
arthur
the
glimpse
was
worth
something
as
a
remembrancer
but
that
was
all
the
voyage
thence
up
the
derwent
frith
displays
a
grand
succession
of
fairy
visions
in
its
entire
length
elsewhere
unequaled
in
gliding
over
the
deep
blue
sea
studded
with
lovely
islets
luxuriant
to
the
water's
edge
one
is
at
a
loss
which
scene
to
choose
for
contemplation
and
to
admire
most
when
the
huon
and
bruni
have
been
passed
there
seems
no
possible
chance
of
a

but
suddenly

and
noble

literally
heaves
in
sight
sternly
guarded
on

by

nelson
and
rumney
presently
we
arrive
at
sullivan's
cove
hobart!
it
is
an
attractive
town
it
sits
on
low
hills
that
slope
to
the
harbor
a
harbor
that
looks
like
a
river
and
is
as
smooth
as
one
its
still
surface
is
pictured
with
dainty
reflections
of
boats
and
grassy
banks
and
luxuriant
foliage
back
of
the
town
rise
highlands
that
are
clothed
in
woodland
loveliness
and
over
the
way
is
that
noble
mountain
wellington
a
stately
bulk
a
most
majestic
pile
how
beautiful
is
the
whole
region
for
form
and
grouping
and
opulence
and
freshness
of
foliage
and
variety
of
color
and
grace
and
shapeliness
of
the
hills
the
capes
the
promontories
and
then
the
splendor
of
the
sunlight
the
dim
rich
distances
the
charm
of
the
water
glimpses!
and
it
was
in
this
paradise
that
the
yellow
liveried
convicts
were
landed
and
the
corps
bandits
quartered
and
the
wanton
slaughter
of
the
kangaroo
chasing
black
innocents
consummated
on
that
autumn
day
in
may
in
the
brutish
old
time
it
was
all
out
of
keeping
with
the
place
a
sort
of
bringing
of
heaven
and
hell
together
the
remembrance
of
this
paradise
reminds
me
that
it
was
at
hobart
that
we
struck
the
head
of
the
procession
of
junior
englands
we
were
to
encounter
other
sections
of
it
in
new
zealand
presently
and
others
later
in
natal
wherever
the
exiled
englishman
can
find
in
his
new
home
resemblances
to
his
old
one
he
is
touched
to
the
marrow
of
his
being
the
love
that
is
in
his
heart
inspires
his
imagination
and
these
allied
forces
transfigure
those
resemblances
into
authentic
duplicates
of
the
revered
originals
it
is
beautiful
the
feeling
which
works
this
enchantment
and
it
compels
one's
homage
compels
it
and
also
compels
one's
assent
compels
it
always
even
when
as
happens
sometimes
one
does
not
see
the
resemblances
as
clearly
as
does
the
exile
who
is
pointing
them
out
the
resemblances
do
exist
it
is
quite
true
and
often
they
cunningly
approximate
the
originals
but
after
all
in
the
matter
of
certain
physical
patent
rights
there
is
only
one
england
now
that
i
have
sampled
the
globe
i
am
not
in
doubt
there
is
a
beauty
of
switzerland
and
it
is
repeated
in
the
glaciers
and
snowy
ranges
of
many
parts
of
the
earth
there
is
a
beauty
of
the
fiord
and
it
is
repeated
in
new
zealand
and
alaska
there
is
a
beauty
of
hawaii
and
it
is
repeated
in
ten
thousand
islands
of
the
southern
seas
there
is
a
beauty
of
the
prairie
and
the
plain
and
it
is
repeated
here
and
there
in
the
earth
each
of
these
is
worshipful
each
is
perfect
in
its
way
yet
holds
no
monopoly
of
its
beauty
but
that
beauty
which
is
england
is
alone
it
has
no
duplicate
it
is
made
up
of
very
simple
details
just
grass
and
trees
and
shrubs
and
roads
and
hedges
and
gardens
and
houses
and
vines
and
churches
and
castles
and
here
and
there
a
ruin
and
over
it
all
a
mellow
dream
haze
of
history
but
its
beauty
is
incomparable
and
all
its
own
hobart
has
a
peculiarity
it
is
the
neatest
town
that
the
sun
shines
on
and
i
incline
to
believe
that
it
is
also
the
cleanest
however
that
may
be
its
supremacy
in
neatness
is
not
to
be
questioned
there
cannot
be
another
town
in
the
world
that
has
no
shabby
exteriors
no
rickety
gates
and
fences
no
neglected
houses
crumbling
to
ruin
no
crazy
and
unsightly
sheds
no
weed
grown
front
yards
of
the
poor
no
back
yards
littered
with
tin
cans
and
old
boots
and
empty
bottles
no
rubbish
in
the
gutters
no
clutter
on
the
sidewalks
no
outer
borders
fraying
out
into
dirty
lanes
and
tin
patched
huts
no
in
hobart
all
the
aspects
are
tidy
and
all
a
comfort
to
the
eye
the
modestest
cottage
looks
combed
and
brushed
and
has
its
vines
its
flowers
its
neat
fence
its
neat
gate
its
comely
cat

on
the
window
ledge
we
had
a
glimpse
of
the
museum
by
courtesy
of
the
american
gentleman
who
is
curator
of
it
it
has
samples
of
half
a
dozen
different
kinds
of
marsupials

is
a
plantigrade
vertebrate
whose
specialty
is
its

in

the
largest
pocket
of
them
all
but
there
is
nothing
in
that
]
one
the
tasmanian
devil
that
is
i
think
he
was
one
of
them
and
there
was
a
fish
with
lungs
when
the
water
dries
up
it
can
live
in
the
mud
most
curious
of
all
was
a
parrot
that
kills
sheep
on
one
great
sheep
run
this
bird
killed
a
thousand
sheep
in
a
whole
year
he
doesn't
want
the
whole
sheep
but
only
the
kidney
fat
this
restricted
taste
makes
him
an
expensive
bird
to
support
to
get
the
fat
he
drives
his
beak
in
and
rips
it
out
the
wound
is
mortal
this
parrot
furnishes
a
notable
example
of
evolution
brought
about
by
changed
conditions
when
the
sheep
culture
was
introduced
it
presently
brought
famine
to
the
parrot
by
exterminating
a
kind
of
grub
which
had
always
thitherto
been
the
parrot's
diet
the
miseries
of
hunger
made
the
bird
willing
to
eat
raw
flesh
since
it
could
get
no
other
food
and
it
began
to
pick
remnants
of
meat
from
sheep
skins
hung
out
on
the
fences
to
dry
it
soon
came
to
prefer
sheep
meat
to
any
other
food
and
by
and
by
it
came
to
prefer
the
kidney
fat
to
any
other
detail
of
the
sheep
the
parrot's
bill
was
not
well
shaped
for
digging
out
the
fat
but
nature
fixed
that
matter
she
altered
the
bill's
shape
and
now
the
parrot
can
dig
out
kidney
fat
better
than
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
or
anybody
else
for
that
matter
even
an
admiral
and
there
was
another
curiosity
quite
a
stunning
one
i
thought
arrow
heads
and
knives
just
like
those
which
primeval
man
made
out
of
flint
and
thought
he
had
done
such
a
wonderful
thing
yes
and
has
been
humored
and
coddled
in
that
superstition
by
this
age
of
admiring
scientists
until
there
is
probably
no
living
with
him
in
the
other
world
by
now
yet
here
is
his
finest
and
nicest
work
exactly
duplicated
in
our
day
and
by
people
who
have
never
heard
of
him
or
his
works
by
aborigines
who
lived
in
the
islands
of
these
seas
within
our
time
and
they
not
only
duplicated
those
works
of
art
but
did
it
in
the
brittlest
and
most
treacherous
of
substances
glass
made
them
out
of
old
brandy
bottles
flung
out
of
the
british
camps
millions
of
tons
of
them
it
is
time
for
primeval
man
to
make
a
little
less
noise
now
he
has
had
his
day
he
is
not
what
he
used
to
be
we
had
a
drive
through
a
bloomy
and
odorous
fairy
land
to
the
refuge
for
the
indigent
a
spacious
and
comfortable
home
with
hospitals
etc
for
both
sexes
there
was
a
crowd
in
there
of
the
oldest
people
i
have
ever
seen
it
was
like
being
suddenly
set
down
in
a
new
world
a
weird
world
where
youth
has
never
been
a
world
sacred
to
age
and
bowed
forms
and
wrinkles
out
of
the
359
persons
present
223
were
ex
convicts
and
could
have
told
stirring
tales
no
doubt
if
they
had
been
minded
to
talk
42
of
the
359
were
past
80
and
several
were
close
upon
90
the
average
age
at
death
there
is
76
years
as
for
me
i
have
no
use
for
that
place
it
is
too
healthy
seventy
is
old
enough
after
that
there
is
too
much
risk
youth
and
gaiety
might
vanish
any
day
and
then
what
is
left
death
in
life
death
without
its
privileges
death
without
its
benefits
there
were
185
women
in
that
refuge
and
81
of
them
were
ex
convicts
the

disappointed
us
instead
of
making
a
long
visit
at

made

we
got

we
spent
part
of
an
afternoon
and
a
night
at
sea
and
reached
bluff
in
new

early
in
the
morning
bluff
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
middle
island
and
is
away
down
south
nearly
forty
seven
degrees
below
the
equator
it
lies
as
far
south
of
the
line
as
quebec
lies
north
of
it
and
the
climates
of
the
two
should
be
alike
but
for
some
reason
or
other
it
has
not
been
so
arranged
quebec
is
hot
in
the
summer
and
cold
in
the
winter
but
bluff's
climate
is
less
intense
the
cold
weather
is
not
very
cold
the
hot
weather
is
not
very
hot
and
the
difference
between
the
hottest

the
rabbit
plague
began
at

the
man
who
introduced
the
rabbit
there
was
banqueted
and
lauded
but
they
would
hang
him
now
if
they
could
get
him
in
england
the
natural
enemy
of
the
rabbit
is
detested
and
persecuted
in
the
bluff
region
the
natural
enemy
of
the
rabbit
is
honored
and
his
person
is
sacred
the
rabbit's
natural
enemy
in
england
is
the
poacher
in
bluff
its
natural
enemy
is
the
stoat
the
weasel
the
ferret
the
cat
and
the
mongoose
in
england
any
person
below
the
heir
who
is
caught
with
a
rabbit
in
his
possession
must
satisfactorily
explain
how
it
got
there
or
he
will
suffer
fine
and
imprisonment
together
with
extinction
of
his
peerage
in
bluff
the
cat
found
with
a
rabbit
in
its
possession
does
not
have
to
explain
everybody
looks
the
other
way
the
person
caught
noticing
would
suffer
fine
and
imprisonment
with
extinction
of
peerage
this
is
a
sure
way
to
undermine
the
moral
fabric
of
a
cat
thirty
years
from
now
there
will
not
be
a
moral
cat
in
new

some
think
there
is
none
there
now
in

the
poacher
is
watched
tracked
hunted
he
dare
not
show
his
face
in

the

the
weasel
the
stoat

go
up

down
whither
they
will
unmolested
by

of
the
legislature
posted
where
all
may
read
it
is
decreed
that
any
person
found
in
possession
of
one
of
these
creatures
dead
must
satisfactorily
explain
the
circumstances
or
pay
a
fine
of
not
less
than
l5
nor
more
than

the
revenue
from
this
source
is
not
large
persons
who
want
to
pay
a
hundred
dollars
for
a
dead
cat
are
getting
rarer
and
rarer
every

this
is

new

would

his

it
was
from

that
we

have

some
of

there
is

nothing
could
be
finer
than
these

nothing
more
intellectual
than
these
faces
nothing
more
masculine
nothing
nobler
than
their
aspect
the
aboriginals
of
australia
and
tasmania
looked
the
savage
but
these
chiefs
looked
like
roman
patricians
the
tattooing
in
these

ought
to
suggest
the
savage
of
course
but
it
does
not
the
designs
are

that

it

get
reconciled
to

ignoble
dr
hockiu
gave
us
a
ghastly
curiosity
a
lignified
caterpillar
with
a
plant
growing
out
of
the
back
of
its
neck
a
plant
with
a
slender
stem
4
inches
high
it
happened
not
by
accident
but
by
design
nature's
design
this
caterpillar
was
in
the
act
of
loyally
carrying
out
a
law
inflicted
upon
him
by
nature
a
law
purposely
inflicted
upon
him
to
get
him
into
trouble
a
law
which
was
a
trap
in
pursuance
of
this
law
he
made
the
proper
preparations
for
turning
himself
into
a
night
moth
that
is
to
say
he
dug
a
little
trench
a
little
grave
and
then
stretched
himself
out
in
it
on
his
stomach
and
partially
buried
himself
then
nature
was
ready
for
him
she
blew
the
spores
of
a
peculiar
fungus
through
the
air
with
a
purpose
some
of
them
fell
into
a
crease
in
the
back
of
the
caterpillar's
neck
and
began
to
sprout
and
grow
for
there
was
soil
there
he
had
not
washed
his
neck
the
roots
forced
themselves
down
into
the
worm's
person
and
rearward
along
through
its
body
sucking
up
the
creature's
juices
for
sap
the
worm
slowly
died
and
turned
to
wood
and
here
he
was
now
a
wooden
caterpillar
with
every
detail
of
his
former
physique
delicately
and
exactly
preserved
and
perpetuated
and
with
that
stem
standing
up
out
of
him
for
his
monument
monument
commemorative
of
his
own
loyalty
and
of
nature's
unfair
return
for
it
nature
is
always
acting
like
that
mrs
x
said
of
course
that
the
caterpillar
was
not
conscious
and
didn't
suffer
she
should
have
known
better
no
caterpillar
can
deceive
nature
if
this
one
couldn't
suffer
nature
would
have
known
it
and
would
have
hunted
up
another
caterpillar
not
that
she
would
have
let
this
one
go
merely
because
it
was
defective
no
she
would
have
waited
and
let
him
turn
into
a
night
moth
and
then
fried
him
in
the
candle
nature
cakes
a
fish's
eyes
over
with
parasites
so
that
it
shan't
be
able
to
avoid
its
enemies
or
find
its
food
she
sends
parasites
into
a
star
fish's
system
which
clog
up
its
prongs
and
swell
them
and
make
them
so
uncomfortable
that
the
poor
creature
delivers
itself
from
the
prong
to
ease
its
misery
and
presently
it
has
to
part
with
another
prong
for
the
sake
of
comfort
and
finally
with
a
third
if
it
re
grows
the
prongs
the
parasite
returns
and
the
same
thing
is
repeated
and
finally
when
the
ability
to
reproduce
prongs
is
lost
through
age
that
poor
old
star
fish
can't
get
around
any
more

so
it

these

call
to

the

cars
at
maryborough
australia
and
the
passengers'
talk
about
the
branch
road
and
the
hotel
somewhere
on
the
road
to
maryborough
i
changed
for
a
while
to
a
smoking
carriage
there
were
two
gentlemen
there
both
riding
backward
one
at
each
end
of
the
compartment
they
were
acquaintances
of
each
other
i
sat
down
facing
the
one
that
sat
at
the
starboard
window
he
had
a
good
face
and
a
friendly
look
and
i
judged
from
his
dress
that
he
was
a
dissenting
minister
he
was
along
toward
fifty
of
his
own
motion
he
struck
a
match
and
shaded
it
with
his
hand
for
me
to
light
my
cigar
i
take
the
rest
from
my
diary
in
order
to
start
conversation
i
asked
him
something
about
maryborough
he
said
in
a
most
pleasant
even
musical
voice
but
with
quiet
and
cultured
decision
it's
a
charming
town
with
a
hell
of
a
hotel
i
was
astonished
it
seemed
so
odd
to
hear
a
minister
swear
out
loud
he
went
placidly
on
it's
the
worst
hotel
in

well
one
may
go
further

say
in

bad

no

at

just

the

too
yes
the

too
just
sand
and
not
a

of

it
packs
too
hard
and
has
never

there
is
too
much

in

might
want
it
again
in
the
night
can't
find
it
in
the
dark
there's
no
trouble
you
can
find
it
by
the
stench
wardrobe
two
nails
on
the
door
to
hang
seven
suits
of
clothes
on
if
you've
got
them
bells
there
aren't
any
what
do
you
do
when
you
want
service
shout
but
it
won't
fetch
anybody
suppose
you
want
the
chambermaid
to
empty
the
slopjar
there
isn't
any
slop
jar
the
hotels
don't
keep
them
that
is
outside
of
sydney
and
melbourne
yes
i
knew
that
i
was
only
talking
it's
the
oddest
thing
in
australia
another
thing
i've
got
to
get
up
in
the
dark
in
the
morning
to
take
the
5
o'clock
train
now
if
the
boots
there
isn't
any
well
the
porter
there
isn't
any
but
who
will
call
me
nobody
you'll
call
yourself
and
you'll
light
yourself
too
there'll
not
be
a
light
burning
in
the
halls
or
anywhere
and
if
you
don't
carry
a
light
you'll
break
your
neck
but
who
will
help
me
down
with
my
baggage
nobody
however
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
in
maryborough
there's
an
american
who
has
lived
there
half
a
lifetime
a
fine
man
and
prosperous
and
popular
he
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
you
you
won't
have
any
trouble
sleep
in
peace
he
will
rout
you
out
and
you
will
make
your
train
where
is
your
manager
i
left
him
at
ballarat
studying
the
language
and
besides
he
had
to
go
to
melbourne
and
get
us
ready
for
new
zealand
i've
not
tried
to
pilot
myself
before
and
it
doesn't
look
easy
easy!
you've
selected
the
very
most
difficult
piece
of
railroad
in
australia
for
your
experiment
there
are
twelve
miles
of
this
road
which
no
man
without
good
executive
ability
can
ever
hope
tell
me
have
you
good
executive
ability
first
rate
executive
ability
i
well
i
think
so
but
that
settles
it
the
tone
of
oh
you
wouldn't
ever
make
it
in
the
world
however
that
american
will
point
you
right
and
you'll
go
you've
got
tickets
yes
round
trip
all
the
way
to
sydney
ah
there
it
is
you
see!
you
are
going
in
the
5
o'clock
by
castlemaine
twelve
miles
instead
of
the
7
15
by
ballarat
in
order
to
save
two
hours
of
fooling
along
the
road
now
then
don't
interrupt
let
me
have
the
floor
you're
going
to
save
the
government
a
deal
of
hauling
but
that's
nothing
your
ticket
is
by
ballarat
and
it
isn't
good
over
that
twelve
miles
and
so
but
why
should
the
government
care
which
way
i
go
goodness
knows!
ask
of
the
winds
that
far
away
with
fragments
strewed
the
sea
as
the
boy
that
stood
on
the
burning
deck
used
to
say
the
government
chooses
to
do
its
railway
business
in
its
own
way
and
it
doesn't
know
as
much
about
it
as
the
french
in
the
beginning
they
tried
idiots
then
they
imported
the
french
which
was
going
backwards
you
see
now
it
runs
the
roads
itself
which
is
going
backwards
again
you
see
why
do
you
know
in
order
to
curry
favor
with
the
voters
the
government
puts
down
a
road
wherever
anybody
wants
it
anybody
that
owns
two
sheep
and
a
dog
and
by
consequence
we've
got
in
the
colony
of
victoria
800
railway
stations
and
the
business
done
at
eighty
of
them
doesn't
foot
up
twenty
shillings
a
week
five
dollars
oh
come!
it's
true
it's
the
absolute
truth
why
there
are
three
or
four
men
on
wages
at
every
station
i
know
it
and
the
station
business
doesn't
pay
for
the
sheep
dip
to
sanctify
their
coffee
with
it's
just
as
i
say
and
accommodating
why
if
you
shake
a
rag
the
train
will
stop
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
to
pick
you
up
all
that
kind
of
politics
costs
you
see
and
then
besides
any
town
that
has
a
good
many
votes
and
wants
a
fine
station
gets
it
don't
you
overlook
that
maryborough
station
if
you
take
an
interest
in
governmental
curiosities
why
you
can
put
the
whole
population
of
maryborough
into
it
and
give
them
a
sofa
apiece
and
have
room
for
more
you
haven't
fifteen
stations
in
america
that
are
as
big
and
you
probably
haven't
five
that
are
half
as
fine
why
it's
perfectly
elegant
and
the
clock!
everybody
will
show
you
the
clock
there
isn't
a
station
in
europe
that's
got
such
a
clock
it
doesn't
strike
and
that's
one
mercy
it
hasn't
any
bell
and
as
you'll
have
cause
to
remember
if
you
keep
your
reason
all
australia
is
simply
bedamned
with
bells
on
every
quarter
hour
night
and
day
they
jingle
a
tiresome
chime
of
half
a
dozen
notes
all
the
clocks
in
town
at
once
all
the
clocks
in
australasia
at
once
and
all
the
very
same
notes
first
downward
scale
mi
re
do
sol
then
upward
scale
sol
si
re
do
down
again
mi
re
do
sol
up
again
sol
si
re
do
then
the
clock
say
at
midnight
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
and
by
that
time
you're
hello
what's
all
this
excitement
about
a
runaway
scared
by
the
train
why
you
think
this
train
could
scare
anything
well
when
they
build
eighty
stations
at
a
loss
and
a
lot
of
palace
stations
and
clocks
like
maryborough's
at
another
loss
the
government
has
got
to
economize
somewhere
hasn't
it
very
well
look
at
the
rolling
stock
that's
where
they
save
the
money
why
that
train
from
maryborough
will
consist
of
eighteen
freight
cars
and
two
passenger
kennels
cheap
poor
shabby
slovenly
no
drinking
water
no
sanitary
arrangements
every
imaginable
inconvenience
and
slow
oh
the
gait
of
cold
molasses
no
air
brake
no
springs
and
they'll
jolt
your
head
off
every
time
they
start
or
stop
that's
where
they
make
their
little
economies
you
see
they
spend
tons
of
money
to
house
you
palatially
while
you
wait
fifteen
minutes
for
a
train
then
degrade
you
to
six
hours'
convict
transportation
to
get
the
foolish
outlay
back
what
a
rational
man
really
needs
is
discomfort
while
he's
waiting
then
his
journey
in
a
nice
train
would
be
a
grateful
change
but
no
that
would
be
common
sense
and
out
of
place
in
a
government
and
then
besides
they
save
in
that
other
little
detail
you
know
repudiate
their
own
tickets
and
collect
a
poor
little
illegitimate
extra
shilling
out
of
you
for
that
twelve
miles
and
well
in
any
case
wait
there's
more
leave
that
american
out
of
the
account
and
see
what
would
happen
there's
nobody
on
hand
to
examine
your
ticket
when
you
arrive
but
the
conductor
will
come
and
examine
it
when
the
train
is
ready
to
start
it
is
too
late
to
buy
your
extra
ticket
now
the
train
can't
wait
and
won't
you
must
climb
out
but
can't
i
pay
the
conductor
no
he
is
not
authorized
to
receive
the
money
and
he
won't
you
must
climb
out
there's
no
other
way
i
tell
you
the
railway
management
is
about
the
only
thoroughly
european
thing
here
continentally
european
i
mean
not
english
it's
the
continental
business
in
perfection
down
fine
oh
yes
even
to
the
peanut
commerce
of
weighing
baggage
the
train
slowed
up
at
his
place
as
he
stepped
out
he
said
yes
you'll
like
maryborough
plenty
of
intelligence
there
it's
a
charming
place
with
a
hell
of
a
hotel
then
he
was
gone
i
turned
to
the
other
gentleman
is
your
friend
in
the
ministry
no
studying
for
it
chapter
xxxii
the
man
with
a
new
idea
is
a
crank
until
the
idea
succeeds
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
it
was
junior
england
all
the
way
to
christchurch
in
fact
just
a
garden
and
christchurch
is
an
english
town
with
an
english
park
annex
and
a
winding
english
brook
just
like
the
avon
and
named
the
avon
but
from
a
man
not
from
shakespeare's
river
its
grassy
banks
are
bordered
by
the
stateliest
and
most
impressive
weeping
willows
to
be
found
in
the
world
i
suppose
they
continue
the
line
of
a
great
ancestor
they
were
grown
from
sprouts
of
the
willow
that
sheltered
napoleon's
grave
in
st
helena
it
is
a
settled
old
community
with
all
the
serenities
the
graces
the
conveniences
and
the
comforts
of
the
ideal
home
life
if
it
had
an
established
church
and
social
inequality
it
would
be
england
over
again
with
hardly
a
lack
in
the
museum
we
saw
many
curious
and
interesting
things
among
others
a
fine
native
house
of
the
olden
time
with
all
the
details
true
to
the
facts
and
the
showy
colors
right
and
in
their
proper
places
all
the
details
the
fine
mats
and
rugs
and
things
the
elaborate
and
wonderful
wood
carvings
wonderful
surely
considering
who
did
them
wonderful
in
design
and
particularly
in
execution
for
they
were
done
with
admirable
sharpness
and
exactness
and
yet
with
no
better
tools
than
flint
and
jade
and
shell
could
furnish
and
the
totem
posts
were
there
ancestor
above
ancestor
with
tongues
protruded
and
hands
clasped
comfortably
over
bellies
containing
other
people's
ancestors
grotesque
and
ugly
devils
every
one
but
lovingly
carved
and
ably
and
the
stuffed
natives
were
present
in
their
proper
places
and
looking
as
natural
as
life
and
the
housekeeping
utensils
were
there
too
and
close
at
hand
the
carved
and
finely
ornamented
war
canoe
and
we
saw
little
jade
gods
to
hang
around
the
neck
not
everybody's
but
sacred
to
the
necks
of
natives
of
rank
also
jade
weapons
and
many
kinds
of
jade
trinkets
all
made
out
of
that
excessively
hard
stone
without
the
help
of
any
tool
of
iron
and
some
of
these
things
had
small
round
holes
bored
through
them
nobody
knows
how
it
was
done
a
mystery
a
lost
art
i
think
it
was
said
that
if
you
want
such
a
hole
bored
in
a
piece
of
jade
now
you
must
send
it
to
london
or
amsterdam
where
the
lapidaries
are
also
we
saw
a
complete
skeleton
of
the
giant
moa
it
stood
ten
feet
high
and
must
have
been
a
sight
to
look
at
when
it
was
a
living
bird
it
was
a
kicker
like
the
ostrich
in
fight
it
did
not
use
its
beak
but
its
foot
it
must
have
been
a
convincing
kind
of
kick
if
a
person
had
his
back
to
the
bird
and
did
not
see
who
it
was
that
did
it
he
would
think
he
had
been
kicked
by
a
wind
mill
there
must
have
been
a
sufficiency
of
moas
in
the
old
forgotten
days
when
his
breed
walked
the
earth
his
bones
are
found
in
vast
masses
all
crammed
together
in
huge
graves
they
are
not
in
caves
but
in
the
ground
nobody
knows
how
they
happened
to
get
concentrated
there
mind
they
are
bones
not
fossils
this
means
that
the
moa
has
not
been
extinct
very
long
still
this
is
the
only
new
zealand
creature
which
has
no
mention
in
that
otherwise
comprehensive
literature
the
native
legends
this
is
a
significant
detail
and
is
good
circumstantial
evidence
that
the
moa
has
been
extinct
500
years
since
the
maori
has
himself
by
tradition
been
in
new
zealand
since
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
he
came
from
an
unknown
land
the
first
maori
did
then
sailed
back
in
his
canoe
and
brought
his
tribe
and
they
removed
the
aboriginal
peoples
into
the
sea
and
into
the
ground
and
took
the
land
that
is
the
tradition
that
that
first
maori
could
come
is
understandable
for
anybody
can
come
to
a
place
when
he
isn't
trying
to
but
how
that
discoverer
found
his
way
back
home
again
without
a
compass
is
his
secret
and
he
died
with
it
in
him
his
language
indicates
that
he
came
from
polynesia
he
told
where
he
came
from
but
he
couldn't
spell
well
so
one
can't
find
the
place
on
the
map
because
people
who
could
spell
better
than
he
could
spelt
the
resemblance
all
out
of
it
when
they
made
the
map
however
it
is
better
to
have
a
map
that
is
spelt
right
than
one
that
has
information
in
it
in
new
zealand
women
have
the
right
to
vote
for
members
of
the
legislature
but
they
cannot
be
members
themselves
the
law
extending
the
suffrage
to
them
event
into
effect
in
1893
the
population
of
christchurch
census
of
1891
was
31
454
the
first
election
under
the
law
was
held
in
november
of
that
year
number
of
men
who
voted
6
313
number
of
women
who
voted
5
989
these
figures
ought
to
convince
us
that
women
are
not
as
indifferent
about
politics
as
some
people
would
have
us
believe
in
new
zealand
as
a
whole
the
estimated
adult
female
population
was
139
915
of
these
109
461
qualified
and
registered
their
names
on
the
rolls
78
23
per

of
the
whole
of
these
90
290
went
to
the
polls
and
voted
85
18
per
cent
do
men
ever
turn
out
better
than
that
in
america
or
elsewhere
here
is
a
remark
to
the
other
sex's
credit
too
i
take
it
from
the
official
report
a
feature
of
the
election
was
the
orderliness
and
sobriety
of
the
people
women
were
in
no
way
molested
at
home
a
standing
argument
against
woman
suffrage
has
always
been
that
women
could
not
go
to
the
polls
without
being
insulted
the
arguments
against
woman
suffrage
have
always
taken
the
easy
form
of
prophecy
the
prophets
have
been
prophesying
ever
since
the
woman's
rights
movement
began
in
1848
and
in
forty
seven
years
they
have
never
scored
a
hit
men
ought
to
begin
to
feel
a
sort
of
respect
for
their
mothers
and
wives
and
sisters
by
this
time
the
women
deserve
a
change
of
attitude
like
that
for
they
have
wrought
well
in
forty
seven
years
they
have
swept
an
imposingly
large
number
of
unfair
laws
from
the
statute
books
of
america
in
that
brief
time
these
serfs
have
set
themselves
free
essentially
men
could
not
have
done
so
much
for
themselves
in
that
time
without
bloodshed
at
least
they
never
have
and
that
is
argument
that
they
didn't
know
how
the
women
have
accomplished
a
peaceful
revolution
and
a
very
beneficent
one
and
yet
that
has
not
convinced
the
average
man
that
they
are
intelligent
and
have
courage
and
energy
and
perseverance
and
fortitude
it
takes
much
to
convince
the
average
man
of
anything
and
perhaps
nothing
can
ever
make
him
realize
that
he
is
the
average
woman's
inferior
yet
in
several
important
details
the
evidences
seems
to
show
that
that
is
what
he
is
man
has
ruled
the
human
race
from
the
beginning
but
he
should
remember
that
up
to
the
middle
of
the
present
century
it
was
a
dull
world
and
ignorant
and
stupid
but
it
is
not
such
a
dull
world
now
and
is
growing
less
and
less
dull
all
the
time
this
is
woman's
opportunity
she
has
had
none
before
i
wonder
where
man
will
be
in
another
forty
seven
years
in
the
new
zealand
law
occurs
this
the
word
person
wherever
it
occurs
throughout
the
act
includes
woman
that
is
promotion
you
see
by
that
enlargement
of
the
word
the
matron
with
the
garnered
wisdom
and
experience
of
fifty
years
becomes
at
one
jump
the
political
equal
of
her
callow

pleasant
days
in

mr
kinsey
gave
me
an
ornithorhynchus
and
i
am
taming
it
sunday
17th
sailed
last
night
in
the
flora
from
lyttelton
so
we
did
i
remember
it
yet
the
people
who
sailed
in
the
flora
that
night
may
forget
some
other
things
if
they
live
a
good
while
but
they
will
not
live
long
enough
to
forget
that
the
flora
is
about
the
equivalent
of
a
cattle
scow
but
when
the
union
company
find
it
inconvenient
to
keep
a
contract
and
lucrative
to
break
it
they
smuggle
her
into
passenger
service
and
keep
the
change
they
give
no
notice
of
their
projected
depredation
you
innocently
buy
tickets
for
the
advertised
passenger
boat
and
when
you
get
down
to
lyttelton
at
midnight
you
find
that
they
have
substituted
the
scow
they
have
plenty
of
good
boats
but
no
competition
and
that
is
the
trouble
it
is
too
late
now
to
make
other
arrangements
if
you
have
engagements
ahead
it
is
a
powerful
company
it
has
a
monopoly
and
everybody
is
afraid
of
it
including
the
government's
representative
who
stands
at
the
end
of
the
stage
plank
to
tally
the
passengers
and
see
that
no
boat
receives
a
greater
number
than
the
law
allows
her
to
carry
this
conveniently
blind
representative
saw
the
scow
receive
a
number
which
was
far
in
excess
of
its
privilege
and
winked
a
politic
wink
and
said
nothing
the
passengers
bore
with
meekness
the
cheat
which
had
been
put
upon
them
and
made
no
complaint
it
was
like
being
at
home
in
america
where
abused
passengers
act
in
just
the
same
way
a
few
days
before
the
union
company
had
discharged
a
captain
for
getting
a
boat
into
danger
and
had
advertised
this
act
as
evidence
of
its
vigilance
in
looking
after
the
safety
of
the
passengers
for
thugging
a
captain
costs
the
company
nothing
but
when
opportunity
offered
to
send
this
dangerously
overcrowded
tub
to
sea
and
save
a
little
trouble
and
a
tidy
penny
by
it
it
forgot
to
worry
about
the
passenger's
safety
the
first
officer
told
me
that
the
flora
was
privileged
to
carry
125
passengers
she
must
have
had
all
of
200
on
board
all
the
cabins
were
full
all
the
cattle
stalls
in
the
main
stable
were
full
the
spaces
at
the
heads
of
companionways
were
full
every
inch
of
floor
and
table
in
the
swill
room
was
packed
with
sleeping
men
and
remained
so
until
the
place
was
required
for
breakfast
all
the
chairs
and
benches
on
the
hurricane
deck
were
occupied
and
still
there
were
people
who
had
to
walk
about
all
night!
if
the
flora
had
gone
down
that
night
half
of
the
people
on
board
would
have
been
wholly
without
means
of
escape
the
owners
of
that
boat
were
not
technically
guilty
of
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
but
they
were
morally
guilty
of
it
i
had
a
cattle
stall
in
the
main
stable
a
cavern
fitted
up
with
a
long
double
file
of
two
storied
bunks
the
files
separated
by
a
calico
partition
twenty
men
and
boys
on
one
side
of
it
twenty
women
and
girls
on
the
other
the
place
was
as
dark
as
the
soul
of
the
union
company
and
smelt
like
a
kennel
when
the
vessel
got
out
into
the
heavy
seas
and
began
to
pitch
and
wallow
the
cavern
prisoners
became
immediately
seasick
and
then
the
peculiar
results
that
ensued
laid
all
my
previous
experiences
of
the
kind
well
away
in
the
shade
and
the
wails
the
groans
the
cries
the
shrieks
the
strange
ejaculations
it
was
wonderful
the
women
and
children
and
some
of
the
men
and
boys
spent
the
night
in
that
place
for
they
were
too
ill
to
leave
it
but
the
rest
of
us
got
up
by
and
by
and
finished
the
night
on
the
hurricane
deck
that
boat
was
the
foulest
i
was
ever
in
and
the
smell
of
the
breakfast
saloon
when
we
threaded
our
way
among
the
layers
of
steaming
passengers
stretched
upon
its
floor
and
its
tables
was
incomparable
for
efficiency
a
good
many
of
us
got
ashore
at
the
first
way
port
to
seek
another
ship
after
a
wait
of
three
hours
we
got
good
rooms
in
the
mahinapua
a
wee
little
bridal
parlor
of
a
boat
only
205
tons
burthen
clean
and
comfortable
good
service
good
beds
good
table
and
no
crowding
the
seas
danced
her
about
like
a
duck
but
she
was
safe
and
capable
next
morning
early
she
went
through
the
french
pass
a
narrow
gateway
of
rock
between
bold
headlands
so
narrow
in
fact
that
it
seemed
no
wider
than
a
street
the
current
tore
through
there
like
a
mill
race
and
the
boat
darted
through
like
a
telegram
the
passage
was
made
in
half
a
minute
then
we
were
in
a
wide
place
where
noble
vast
eddies
swept
grandly
round
and
round
in
shoal
water
and
i
wondered
what
they
would
do
with
the
little
boat
they
did
as
they
pleased
with
her
they
picked
her
up
and
flung
her
around
like
nothing
and
landed
her
gently
on
the
solid
smooth
bottom
of
sand
so
gently
indeed
that
we
barely
felt
her
touch
it
barely
felt
her
quiver
when
she
came
to
a
standstill
the
water
was
as
clear
as
glass
the
sand
on
the
bottom
was
vividly
distinct
and
the
fishes
seemed
to
be
swimming
about
in
nothing
fishing
lines
were
brought
out
but
before
we
could
bait
the
hooks
the
boat
was
off
and
away
again
chapter
xxxiii
let
us
be
grateful
to
adam
our
benefactor
he
cut
us
out
of
the
blessing
of
idleness
and
won
for
us
the
curse
of
labor
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
we
soon
reached
the
town
of
nelson
and
spent
the
most
of
the
day
there
visiting
acquaintances
and
driving
with
them
about
the
garden
the
whole
region
is
a
garden
excepting
the
scene
of
the
maungatapu
murders
of
thirty
years
ago
that
is
a
wild
place
wild
and
lonely
an
ideal
place
for
a
murder
it
is
at
the
base
of
a
vast
rugged
densely
timbered
mountain
in
the
deep
twilight
of
that
forest
solitude
four
desperate
rascals
burgess
sullivan
levy
and
kelley
ambushed
themselves
beside
the
mountain
trail
to
murder
and
rob
four
travelers
kempthorne
mathieu
dudley
and
de
pontius
the
latter
a
new
yorker
a
harmless
old
laboring
man
came
wandering
along
and
as
his
presence
was
an
embarrassment
they
choked
him
hid
him
and
then
resumed
their
watch
for
the
four
they
had
to
wait
a
while
but
eventually
everything
turned
out
as
they
desired
that
dark
episode
is
the
one
large
event
in
the
history
of
nelson
the
fame
of
it
traveled
far
burgess
made
a
confession
it
is
a
remarkable
paper
for
brevity
succinctness
and
concentration
it
is
perhaps
without
its
peer
in
the
literature
of
murder
there
are
no
waste
words
in
it
there
is
no
obtrusion
of
matter
not
pertinent
to
the
occasion
nor
any
departure
from
the
dispassionate
tone
proper
to
a
formal
business
statement
for
that
is
what
it
is
a
business
statement
of
a
murder
by
the
chief
engineer
of
it
or
superintendent
or
foreman
or
whatever
one
may
prefer
to
call
him
we
were
getting
impatient
when
we
saw
four
men
and
a
pack
horse
coming
i
left
my
cover
and
had
a
look
at
the
men
for
levy
had
told
me
that
mathieu
was
a
small
man
and
wore
a
large
beard
and
that
it
was
a
chestnut
horse
i
said
'here
they
come
'
they
were
then
a
good
distance
away
i
took
the
caps
off
my
gun
and
put
fresh
ones
on
i
said
'you
keep
where
you
are
i'll
put
them
up
and
you
give
me
your
gun
while
you
tie
them
'
it
was
arranged
as
i
have
described
the
men
came
they
arrived
within
about
fifteen
yards
when
i
stepped
up
and
said
'stand!
bail
up!'
that
means
all
of
them
to
get
together
i
made
them
fall
back
on
the
upper
side
of
the
road
with
their
faces
up
the
range
and
sullivan
brought
me
his
gun
and
then
tied
their
hands
behind
them
the
horse
was
very
quiet
all
the
time
he
did
not
move
when
they
were
all
tied
sullivan
took
the
horse
up
the
hill
and
put
him
in
the
bush
he
cut
the
rope
and
let
the
swags
[a
swag
is
a
kit
a
pack
small
baggage
]
fall
on
the
ground
and
then
came
to
me
we
then
marched
the
men
down
the
incline
to
the
creek
the
water
at
this
time
barely
running
up
this
creek
we
took
the
men
we
went
i
daresay
five
or
six
hundred
yards
up
it
which
took
us
nearly
half
an
hour
to
accomplish
then
we
turned
to
the
right
up
the
range
we
went
i
daresay
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
the
creek
and
there
we
sat
down
with
the
men
i
said
to
sullivan
'put
down
your
gun
and
search
these
men
'
which
he
did
i
asked
them
their
several
names
they
told
me
i
asked
them
if
they
were
expected
at
nelson
they
said
'no
'
if
such
their
lives
would
have
been
spared
in
money
we
took
l60
odd
i
said
'is
this
all
you
have
you
had
better
tell
me
'
sullivan
said
'here
is
a
bag
of
gold
'
i
said
'what's
on
that
pack
horse
is
there
any
gold
'
when
kempthorne
said
'yes
my
gold
is
in
the
portmanteau
and
i
trust
you
will
not
take
it
all
'
'well
'
i
said
'we
must
take
you
away
one
at
a
time
because
the
range
is
steep
just
here
and
then
we
will
let
you
go
'
they
said
'all
right
'
most
cheerfully
we
tied
their
feet
and
took
dudley
with
us
we
went
about
sixty
yards
with
him
this
was
through
a
scrub
it
was
arranged
the
night
previously
that
it
would
be
best
to
choke
them
in
case
the
report
of
the
arms
might
be
heard
from
the
road
and
if
they
were
missed
they
never
would
be
found
so
we
tied
a
handkerchief
over
his
eyes
when
sullivan
took
the
sash
off
his
waist
put
it
round
his
neck
and
so
strangled
him
sullivan
after
i
had
killed
the
old
laboring
man
found
fault
with
the
way
he
was
choked
he
said
'the
next
we
do
i'll
show
you
my
way
'
i
said
'i
have
never
done
such
a
thing
before
i
have
shot
a
man
but
never
choked
one
'
we
returned
to
the
others
when
kempthorne
said
'what
noise
was
that
'
i
said
it
was
caused
by
breaking
through
the
scrub
this
was
taking
too
much
time
so
it
was
agreed
to
shoot
them
with
that
i
said
'we'll
take
you
no
further
but
separate
you
and
then
loose
one
of
you
and
he
can
relieve
the
others
'
so
with
that
sullivan
took
de
pontius
to
the
left
of
where
kempthorne
was
sitting
i
took
mathieu
to
the
right
i
tied
a
strap
round
his
legs
and
shot
him
with
a
revolver
he
yelled
i
ran
from
him
with
my
gun
in
my
hand
i
sighted
kempthorne
who
had
risen
to
his
feet
i
presented
the
gun
and
shot
him
behind
the
right
ear
his
life's
blood
welled
from
him
and
he
died
instantaneously
sullivan
had
shot
de
pontius
in
the
meantime
and
then
came
to
me
i
said
'look
to
mathieu
'
indicating
the
spot
where
he
lay
he
shortly
returned
and
said
'i
had
to
chiv
that
fellow
he
was
not
dead
'
a
cant
word
meaning
that
he
had
to
stab
him
returning
to
the
road
we
passed
where
de
pontius
lay
and
was
dead
sullivan
said
'this
is
the
digger
the
others
were
all
storekeepers
this
is
the
digger
let's
cover
him
up
for
should
the
others
be
found
they'll
think
he
done
it
and
sloped
'
meaning
he
had
gone
so
with
that
we
threw
all
the
stones
on
him
and
then
left
him
this
bloody
work
took
nearly
an
hour
and
a
half
from
the
time
we
stopped
the
men
anyone
who
reads
that
confession
will
think
that
the
man
who
wrote
it
was
destitute
of
emotions
destitute
of
feeling
that
is
partly
true
as
regarded
others
he
was
plainly
without
feeling
utterly
cold
and
pitiless
but
as
regarded
himself
the
case
was
different
while
he
cared
nothing
for
the
future
of
the
murdered
men
he
cared
a
great
deal
for
his
own
it
makes
one's
flesh
creep
to
read
the
introduction
to
his
confession
the
judge
on
the
bench
characterized
it
as
scandalously
blasphemous
and
it
certainly
reads
so
but
burgess
meant
no
blasphemy
he
was
merely
a
brute
and
whatever
he
said
or
wrote
was
sure
to
expose
the
fact
his
redemption
was
a
very
real
thing
to
him
and
he
was
as
jubilantly
happy
on
the
gallows
as
ever
was
christian
martyr
at
the
stake
we
dwellers
in
this
world
are
strangely
made
and
mysteriously
circumstanced
we
have
to
suppose
that
the
murdered
men
are
lost
and
that
burgess
is
saved
but
we
cannot
suppress
our
natural
regrets
written
in
my
dungeon
drear
this
7th
of
august
in
the
year
of
grace
1866
to
god
be
ascribed
all
power
and
glory
in
subduing
the
rebellious
spirit
of
a
most
guilty
wretch
who
has
been
brought
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
faithful
follower
of
christ
to
see
his
wretched
and
guilty
state
inasmuch
as
hitherto
he
has
led
an
awful
and
wretched
life
and
through
the
assurance
of
this
faithful
soldier
of
christ
he
has
been
led
and
also
believes
that
christ
will
yet
receive
and
cleanse
him
from
all
his
deep
dyed
and
bloody
sins
i
lie
under
the
imputation
which
says
'come
now
and
let
us
reason
together
saith
the
lord
though
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow
though
they
be
red
like
crimson
they
shall
be
as
wool
'
on
this
promise
i
rely
we
sailed
in
the
afternoon
late
spent
a
few
hours
at
new
plymouth
then
sailed
again
and
reached
auckland
the
next
day
november
20th
and
remained
in
that
fine
city
several
days
its
situation
is
commanding
and
the
sea
view
is
superb
there
are
charming
drives
all
about
and
by
courtesy
of
friends
we
had
opportunity
to
enjoy
them
from
the
grassy
crater
summit
of
mount
eden
one's
eye
ranges
over
a
grand
sweep
and
variety
of
scenery
forests
clothed
in
luxuriant
foliage
rolling
green
fields
conflagrations
of
flowers
receding
and
dimming
stretches
of
green
plain
broken
by
lofty
and
symmetrical
old
craters
then
the
blue
bays
twinkling
and
sparkling
away
into
the
dreamy
distances
where
the
mountains
loom
spiritual
in
their
veils
of
haze
it
is
from
auckland
that
one
goes
to
rotorua
the
region
of
the
renowned
hot
lakes
and
geysers
one
of
the
chief
wonders
of
new
zealand
but
i
was
not
well
enough
to
make
the
trip
the
government
has
a
sanitorium
there
and
everything
is
comfortable
for
the
tourist
and
the
invalid
the
government's
official
physician
is
almost
over
cautious
in
his
estimates
of
the
efficacy
of
the
baths
when
he
is
talking
about
rheumatism
gout
paralysis
and
such
things
but
when
he
is
talking
about
the
effectiveness
of
the
waters
in
eradicating
the
whisky
habit
he
seems
to
have
no
reserves
the
baths
will
cure
the
drinking
habit
no
matter
how
chronic
it
is
and
cure
it
so
effectually
that
even
the
desire
to
drink
intoxicants
will
come
no
more
there
should
be
a
rush
from
europe
and
america
to
that
place
and
when
the
victims
of
alcoholism
find
out
what
they
can
get
by
going
there
the
rush
will
begin
the
thermal
springs

of

of

smooth
and
looks
like

to
day
we
reached
gisborne
and
anchored
in
a
big
bay
there
was
a
heavy
sea
on
so
we
remained
on
board
we
were
a
mile
from
shore
a
little
steam
tug
put
out
from
the
land
she
was
an
object
of
thrilling
interest
she
would
climb
to
the
summit
of
a
billow
reel
drunkenly
there
a
moment
dim
and
gray
in
the
driving
storm
of
spindrift
then
make
a
plunge
like
a
diver
and
remain
out
of
sight
until
one
had
given
her
up
then
up
she
would
dart
again
on
a
steep
slant
toward
the
sky
shedding
niagaras
of
water
from
her
forecastle
and
this
she
kept
up
all
the
way
out
to
us
she
brought
twenty
five
passengers
in
her
stomach

and
women

a

dramatic
company
in
sight
on
deck
were
the
crew
in
sou'westers
yellow
waterproof
canvas
suits
and
boots
to
the
thigh
the
deck
was
never
quiet
for
a
moment
and
seldom
nearer
level
than
a
ladder
and
noble
were
the
seas
which
leapt
aboard
and
went
flooding
aft
we
rove
a
long
line
to
the
yard
arm
hung
a
most
primitive
basketchair
to
it
and
swung
it
out
into
the
spacious
air
of
heaven
and
there
it
swayed
pendulum
fashion
waiting
for
its
chance
then
down
it
shot
skillfully
aimed
and
was
grabbed
by
the
two
men
on
the
forecastle
a
young
fellow
belonging
to
our
crew
was
in
the
chair
to
be
a
protection
to
the
lady
comers
at
once
a
couple
of
ladies
appeared
from
below
took
seats
in
his
lap
we
hoisted
them
into
the
sky
waited
a
moment
till
the
roll
of
the
ship
brought
them
in
overhead
then
we
lowered
suddenly
away
and
seized
the
chair
as
it
struck
the
deck
we
took
the
twenty
five
aboard
and
delivered
twenty
five
into
the
tug
among
them
several
aged
ladies
and
one
blind
one
and
all
without

it
was

roomy

well
ordered

satisfactory
now
and
then
we
step
on
a
rat
in
a
hotel
but
we
have
had
no
rats
on
shipboard
lately
unless
perhaps
in
the
flora
we
had
more
serious
things
to
think
of
there
and
did
not
notice
i
have
noticed
that
it
is
only
in
ships
and
hotels
which
still
employ
the
odious
chinese
gong
that
you
find
rats
the
reason
would
seem
to
be
that
as
a
rat
cannot
tell

of

by

he
won't
stay

we

tumultuously
piled
skyward
on
the
broken
highlands
not
the
customary
roof
like
slant
of

where
the

are

the

of

were
of

we
were
told
the
timber
that
is
now
furnishing
the
wood
paving
for
europe
and
is
the
best
of
all
wood
for
that
purpose
sometimes
these
towering
upheavals
of
forestry
were
festooned
and
garlanded
with
vine
cables
and
sometimes
the
masses
of
undergrowth
were
cocooned
in

sort
of

a

with

from

a

and
there
was
a
ten
foot
reed
with
a
flowing
suit
of
what
looked
like
yellow
hair
hanging
from
its
upper
end
i

smythe
i
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
could
see
the
right
hand
wall
the
others
had
their
backs
to
it
on
that
wall
at
a
good
distance
away
were
a
couple
of
framed
pictures
i
could
not
see
them
clearly
but
from
the
groupings
of
the
figures
i
fancied
that
they
represented
the
killing
of
napoleon
iii's
son
by
the
zulus
in
south
africa
i
broke
into
the
conversation
which
was
about
poetry
and
cabbage
and
art
and
said
to
my
wife
do
you
remember
when
the
news
came
to
paris
of
the
killing
of
the
prince
those
were
the
very
words
i
had
in
my
mind
yes
but
what
prince
napoleon
lulu
what
made
you
think
of
that
i
don't
know
there
was
no
collusion
she
had
not
seen
the
pictures
and
they
had
not
been
mentioned
she
ought
to
have
thought
of
some
recent
news
that
came
to
paris
for
we
were
but
seven
months
from
there
and
had
been
living
there
a
couple
of
years
when
we
started
on
this
trip
but
instead
of
that
she
thought
of
an
incident
of
our
brief
sojourn
in
paris
of
sixteen
years
before
here
was
a
clear
case
of
mental
telegraphy
of
mind
transference
of
my
mind
telegraphing
a
thought
into
hers
how
do
i
know
because
i
telegraphed
an
error
for
it
turned
out
that
the
pictures
did
not
represent
the
killing
of
lulu
at
all
nor
anything
connected
with
lulu
she
had
to
get
the
error
from
my
head
it
existed
nowhere
else

a
pleasant
trip
yesterday
per
ballarat
fly
four
hours
i
do
not
know
the
distance
but
it
must
have
been
well
along
toward
fifty
miles
the
fly
could
have
spun
it
out
to
eight
hours
and
not
discommoded
me
for
where
there
is
comfort
and
no
need
for
hurry
speed
is
of
no
value
at
least
to
me
and
nothing
that
goes
on
wheels
can
be
more
comfortable
more
satisfactory
than
the
new
zealand
trains
outside
of
america
there
are
no
cars
that
are
so
rationally
devised
when
you
add
the
constant
presence
of
charming
scenery
and
the
nearly
constant
absence
of
dust
well
if
one
is
not
content
then
he
ought
to
get
out
and
walk
that
would
change
his
spirit
perhaps
i
think
so
at
the
end
of
an
hour
you
would
find
him
waiting
humbly
beside
the
track
and
glad
to
be
taken
aboard
again

large
strong
carpeted
from
end
to
end
with

and
decorated
with

wood
carvings
artistically
executed
the
maoris
were
very
polite
i
was
assured
by
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
that
the
native
race
is
not
decreasing
but
actually
increasing
slightly
it
is
another
evidence
that
they
are
a
superior
breed
of
savages
i
do
not
call
to
mind
any
savage
race
that
built
such
good
houses
or
such
strong
and
ingenious
and
scientific
fortresses
or
gave
so
much
attention
to
agriculture
or
had
military
arts
and
devices
which
so
nearly
approached
the
white
man's
these
taken
together
with
their
high
abilities
in
boat
building
and
their
tastes
and
capacities
in
the
ornamental
arts
modify
their
savagery
to
a
semi
civilization
or
at
least
to
a
quarter
civilization
it
is
a
compliment
to
them
that
the
british
did
not
exterminate
them
as
they
did
the
australians
and
the
tasmanians
but
were
content
with
subduing
them
and
showed
no
desire
to
go
further
and
it
is
another
compliment
to
them
that
the
british
did
not
take
the
whole
of
their
choicest
lands
but
left
them
a
considerable
part
and
then
went
further
and
protected
them
from
the
rapacities
of
landsharks
a
protection
which
the
new
zealand
government
still
extends
to
them
and
it
is
still
another
compliment
to
the
maoris
that
the
government
allows
native
representation
in
both
the
legislature
and
the
cabinet
and
gives
both
sexes
the
vote
and
in
doing
these
things
the
government
also
compliments
itself
it
has
not
been
the
custom
of
the
world
for
conquerors
to
act
in
this
large
spirit
toward
the
conquered
the
highest
class
white
men
who
lived
among
the
maoris
in
the
earliest
time
had
a
high
opinion
of
them
and
a
strong
affection
for
them
among
the
whites
of
this
sort
was
the
author
of
old
new
zealand
and
dr
campbell
of
auckland
was
another
dr
campbell
was
a
close
friend
of
several
chiefs
and
has
many
pleasant
things
to
say
of
their
fidelity
their
magnanimity
and
their
generosity
also
of
their
quaint
notions
about
the
white
man's
queer
civilization
and
their
equally
quaint
comments
upon
it
one
of
them
thought
the
missionary
had
got
everything
wrong
end
first
and
upside
down
why
he
wants
us
to
stop
worshiping
and
supplicating
the
evil
gods
and
go
to
worshiping
and
supplicating
the
good
one!
there
is
no
sense
in
that
a
good
god
is
not
going
to
do
us
any
harm
the
maoris
had
the
tabu
and
had
it
on
a
polynesian
scale
of
comprehensiveness
and
elaboration
some
of
its
features
could
have
been
importations
from
india
and
judea
neither
the
maori
nor
the
hindoo
of
common
degree
could
cook
by
a
fire
that
a
person
of
higher
caste
had
used
nor
could
the
high
maori
or
high
hindoo
employ
fire
that
had
served
a
man
of
low
grade
if
a
low
grade
maori
or
hindoo
drank
from
a
vessel
belonging
to
a
high
grade
man
the
vessel
was
defiled
and
had
to
be
destroyed
there
were
other
resemblances
between
maori
tabu
and
hindoo
caste
custom
yesterday
a
lunatic
burst
into
my
quarters
and
warned
me
that
the
jesuits
were
going
to
cook
poison
me
in
my
food
or
kill
me
on
the
stage
at
night
he
said
a
mysterious
sign
was
visible
upon
my
posters
and
meant
my
death
he
said
he
saved
rev
mr
haweis's
life
by
warning
him
that
there
were
three
men
on
his
platform
who
would
kill
him
if
he
took
his
eyes
off
them
for
a
moment
during
his
lecture
the
same
men
were
in
my
audience
last
night
but
they
saw
that
he
was
there
will
they
be
there
again
to
night
he
hesitated
then
said
no
he
thought
they
would
rather
take
a
rest
and
chance
the
poison
this
lunatic
has
no
delicacy
but
he
was
not
uninteresting
he
told
me
a
lot
of
things
he
said
he
had
saved
so
many
lecturers
in
twenty
years
that
they
put
him
in
the
asylum
i
think
he
has
less
refinement
than
any
lunatic
i
have
met
december

a
couple
of
curious
war
monuments
here
at
wanganui
one
is
in
honor
of
white
men
who
fell
in

of

against
fanaticism
and

are

in

english
in

english
in
the

so
let
us
hope
for
the
honor
of
the
blend
for
the
honor
of
the
blood
for
the
honor
of
the
race
that
that
word
got
there
through
lack
of
heedfulness
and
will
not
be
suffered
to
remain
if
you
carve
it
at
thermopylae
or
where
winkelried
died
or
upon
bunker
hill
monument
and
read
it
again
who
fell
in
defence
of
law
and
order
against
fanaticism
you
will
perceive
what
the
word
means
and
how
mischosen
it
is
patriotism
is
patriotism
calling
it
fanaticism
cannot
degrade
it
nothing
can
degrade
it
even
though
it
be
a
political
mistake
and
a
thousand
times
a
political
mistake
that
does
not
affect
it
it
is
honorable

always

and
privileged

hold
its
head
up
and
look
the
nations
in
the
face
it
is
right
to
praise
these
brave
white
men
who
fell
in
the
maori
war
they
deserve
it
but
the
presence
of
that
word
detracts
from
the
dignity
of
their
cause
and
their
deeds
and
makes
them
appear
to
have
spilt
their
blood
in
a
conflict
with
ignoble
men
men
not
worthy
of
that
costly
sacrifice
but
the
men
were
worthy
it
was
no
shame
to
fight
them
they
fought
for
their
homes
they
fought
for
their
country
they
bravely
fought
and
bravely
fell
and
it
would
take
nothing
from
the
honor
of
the
brave
englishmen
who
lie
under
the
monument
but
add
to
it
to
say
that
they
died
in
defense
of
english
laws
and
english
homes
against
men
worthy
of
the
sacrifice
the
maori
patriots
the
other
monument
cannot
be
rectified
except
with
dynamite
it
is
a
mistake
all
through
and
a
strangely
thoughtless
one
it
is
a
monument
erected
by
white
men
to
maoris
who
fell
fighting
with
the
whites
and
against
their
own
people
in
the
maori
war
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
brave
men
who
fell
on
the
14th
of
may
1864
etc
on
one
side
are
the
names
of
about
twenty
maoris
it
is
not
a
fancy
of
mine
the
monument
exists
i
saw
it
it
is
an
object
lesson
to
the
rising
generation
it
invites
to
treachery
disloyalty
unpatriotism
its
lesson
in
frank
terms
is
desert
your
flag
slay
your
people
burn
their
homes
shame
your
nationality

it
is
a
fine
city
and
nobly
situated
a
busy
place
and
full
of
life
and
movement
have
spent
the
three
days
partly
in
walking
about
partly
in
enjoying
social
privileges
and
largely
in
idling
around
the
magnificent
garden
at
hutt
a
little
distance
away
around
the
shore
i
suppose
we
shall
not
see
such
another
one
soon
we
are
packing
to
night
for
the
return
voyage
to
australia
our
stay
in
new
zealand
has
been
too
brief
still
we
are
not
unthankful
for
the
glimpse
which
we
have
had
of
it
the
sturdy
maoris
made
the
settlement
of
the
country
by
the
whites
rather
difficult
not
at
first
but
later
at
first
they
welcomed
the
whites
and
were
eager
to
trade
with
them
particularly
for
muskets
for
their
pastime
was
internecine
war
and
they
greatly
preferred
the
white
man's
weapons
to
their
own
war
was
their
pastime
i
use
the
word
advisedly
they
often
met
and
slaughtered
each
other
just
for
a
lark
and
when
there
was
no
quarrel
the
author
of
old
new
zealand
mentions
a
case
where
a
victorious
army
could
have
followed
up
its
advantage
and
exterminated
the
opposing
army
but
declined
to
do
it
explaining
naively
that
if
we
did
that
there
couldn't
be
any
more
fighting
in
another
battle
one
army
sent
word
that
it
was
out
of
ammunition
and
would
be
obliged
to
stop
unless
the
opposing
army
would
send
some
it
was
sent
and
the
fight
went
on
in
the
early
days
things
went
well
enough
the
natives
sold
land
without
clearly
understanding
the
terms
of
exchange
and
the
whites
bought
it
without
being
much
disturbed
about
the
native's
confusion
of
mind
but
by
and
by
the
maori
began
to
comprehend
that
he
was
being
wronged
then
there
was
trouble
for
he
was
not
the
man
to
swallow
a
wrong
and
go
aside
and
cry
about
it
he
had
the
tasmanian's
spirit
and
endurance
and
a
notable
share
of
military
science
besides
and
so
he
rose
against
the
oppressor
did
this
gallant
fanatic
and
started
a
war
that
was
not
brought
to
a
definite
end
until
more
than
a
generation
had
sped

one
does
not
read
prose
at
such
a
time
but
poetry
i
have
been
reading
the
poems
of
mrs
julia
a
moore
again
and
i
find
in
them
the
same
grace
and
melody
that
attracted
me
when
they
were
first
published
twenty
years
ago
and
have
held
me
in
happy
bonds
ever
since
the
sentimental
song
book
has
long
been
out
of
print
and
has
been
forgotten
by
the
world
in
general
but
not
by
me
i
carry
it
with
me
always
it
and
goldsmith's
deathless
story
indeed
it
has
the
same
deep
charm
for
me
that
the
vicar
of
wakefield
has
and
i
find
in
it
the
same
subtle
touch
the
touch
that
makes
an
intentionally
humorous
episode
pathetic
and
an
intentionally
pathetic
one
funny
in
her
time
mrs
moore
was
called
the
sweet
singer
of
michigan
and
was
best
known
by
that
name
i
have
read
her
book
through
twice
today
with
the
purpose
of
determining
which
of
her
pieces
has
most
merit
and
i
am
persuaded
that
for
wide
grasp
and
sustained
power
william
upson
may
claim
first
place
william

air
the
major's
only
son
come
all
good
people
far
and
near
oh
come
and
see
what
you
can
hear
it's
of
a
young
man
true
and
brave
that
is
now
sleeping
in
his
grave
now
william
upson
was
his
name
if
it's
not
that
it's
all
the
same
he
did
enlist
in
a
cruel
strife
and
it
caused
him
to
lose
his
life
he
was
perry
upson's
eldest
son
his
father
loved
his
noble
son
this
son
was
nineteen
years
of
age
when
first
in
the
rebellion
he
engaged
his
father
said
that
he
might
go
but
his
dear
mother
she
said
no
oh!
stay
at
home
dear
billy
she
said
but
she
could
not
turn
his
head
he
went
to
nashville
in
tennessee
there
his
kind
friends
he
could
not
see
he
died
among
strangers
so
far
away
they
did
not
know
where
his
body
lay
he
was
taken
sick
and
lived
four
weeks
and
oh!
how
his
parents
weep
but
now
they
must
in
sorrow
mourn
for
billy
has
gone
to
his
heavenly
home
oh!
if
his
mother
could
have
seen
her
son
for
she
loved
him
her
darling
son
if
she
could
heard
his
dying
prayer
it
would
ease
her
heart
till
she
met
him
there
how
it
would
relieve
his
mother's
heart
to
see
her
son
from
this
world
depart
and
hear
his
noble
words
of
love
as
he
left
this
world
for
that
above
now
it
will
relieve
his
mother's
heart
for
her
son
is
laid
in
our
graveyard
for
now
she
knows
that
his
grave
is
near
she
will
not
shed
so
many
tears
although
she
knows
not
that
it
was
her
son
for
his
coffin
could
not
be
opened
it
might
be
someone
in
his
place
for
she
could
not
see
his
noble
face
december

reached
sydney
december
19
in
the
train
fellow
of
30
with
four
valises
a
slim
creature
with
teeth
which
made
his
mouth
look
like
a
neglected
churchyard
he
had
solidified
hair
solidified
with
pomatum
it
was
all
one
shell
he
smoked
the
most
extraordinary
cigarettes
made
of
some
kind
of
manure
apparently
these
and
his
hair
made
him
smell
like
the
very
nation
he
had
a
low
cut
vest
on
which
exposed
a
deal
of
frayed
and
broken
and
unclean
shirtfront
showy
studs
of
imitation
gold
they
had
made
black
disks
on
the
linen
oversized
sleeve
buttons
of
imitation
gold
the
copper
base
showing
through
ponderous
watch
chain
of
imitation
gold
i
judge
that
he
couldn't
tell
the
time
by
it
for
he
asked
smythe
what
time
it
was
once
he
wore
a
coat
which
had
been
gay
when
it
was
young
5
o'clock
tea
trousers
of
a
light
tint
and
marvelously
soiled
yellow
mustache
with
a
dashing
upward
whirl
at
the
ends
foxy
shoes
imitation
patent
leather
he
was
a
novelty
an
imitation
dude
he
would
have
been
a
real
one
if
he
could
have
afforded
it
but
he
was
satisfied
with
himself
you
could
see
it
in
his
expression
and
in
all
his
attitudes
and
movements
he
was
living
in
a
dude
dreamland
where
all
his
squalid
shams
were
genuine
and
himself
a
sincerity
it
disarmed
criticism
it
mollified
spite
to
see
him
so
enjoy
his
imitation
languors
and
arts
and
airs
and
his
studied
daintinesses
of
gesture
and
misbegotten
refinements
it
was
plain
to
me
that
he
was
imagining
himself
the
prince
of
wales
and
was
doing
everything
the
way
he
thought
the
prince
would
do
it
for
bringing
his
four
valises
aboard
and
stowing
them
in
the
nettings
he
gave
his
porter
four
cents
and
lightly
apologized
for
the
smallness
of
the
gratuity
just
with
the
condescendingest
little
royal
air
in
the
world
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
front
seat
and
rested
his
pomatum
cake
on
the
middle
arm
and
stuck
his
feet
out
of
the
window
and
began
to
pose
as
the
prince
and
work
his
dreams
and
languors
for
exhibition
and
he
would
indolently
watch
the
blue
films
curling
up
from
his
cigarette
and
inhale
the
stench
and
look
so
grateful
and
would
flip
the
ash
away
with
the
daintiest
gesture
unintentionally
displaying
his
brass
ring
in
the
most
intentional
way
why
it
was
as
good
as
being
in
marlborough
house
itself
to
see
him
do
it
so
like
there
was
other
scenery
in
the
trip
that
of
the
hawksbury
river
in
the
national
park

extraordinarily

imposingly
framed

and

of

and
the
most
enchanting
rearrangements
of
the
water
effects
further
along
green

thinly
covered
with
gum
forests
with
here
and
there

to
see
how

no
one
knows

he
finds
out
the

date
but
no
doubt
he
comes
down
to
the
dock
every
day
and
takes
a
look
and
when
he
sees
baggage
and
passengers
flocking
in
recognizes
that
it

another

said
there
is
no

in

for

wine
but
it
goes
to

and
comes
back
with
a
french
label
on
it
and
then
they
buy
it
i
have
heard
that
the
most
of
the
french
labeled
claret
in
new

is
made
in
california
and
i
remember
what
professor
s
told
me
once
about
veuve
cliquot
if
that
was
the
wine
and
i
think
it
was
he
was
the
guest
of
a
great
wine
merchant
whose
town
was
quite
near
that
vineyard
and
this
merchant
asked
him
if
very
much
v
c
was
drunk
in
america
oh
yes
said
s
a
great
abundance
of
it
is
it

oh
yes
easy

all

second

you
pay

it

on

oh

why
it's
worth

right
here

no!
yes!
do
you
mean
that
we
are
drinking
a
bogus
veuve
cliquot
over
there
yes
and
there
was
never
a
bottle
of
the
genuine
in
america
since
columbus's
time
that
wine
all
comes
from
a
little
bit
of
a
patch
of
ground
which
isn't
big
enough
to
raise
many
bottles
and
all
of
it

the
vulture
is
from
the
public
menagerie
at
adelaide
a
great
and
interesting
collection
it
was
there
that
we
saw
the
baby
tiger
solemnly
spreading
its
mouth
and
trying
to
roar
like
its
majestic
mother
it
swaggered
scowling
back
and
forth
on
its
short
legs
just
as
it
had
seen
her
do
on
her
long
ones
and
now
and
then
snarling
viciously
exposing
its
teeth
with
a
threatening
lift
of
its
upper
lip
and
bristling
moustache
and
when
it
thought
it
was
impressing
the
visitors
it
would
spread
its
mouth
wide
and
do
that
screechy
cry
which
it
meant
for
a
roar
but
which
did
not
deceive
it
took
itself
quite
seriously
and
was
lovably
comical
and
there
was
a
hyena
an
ugly
creature
as
ugly
as
the
tiger
kitty
was
pretty
it
repeatedly
arched
its
back
and
delivered
itself
of
such
a
human
cry
a
startling
resemblance
a
cry
which
was
just
that
of
a
grown
person
badly
hurt
in
the
dark

would
assuredly
go
to
its
assistance

be
disappointed
many
friends
of

federation
on

they
feel
sure
that
the
good
day
is
not
far
off

but
there
seems
to
be
a
party
that
would
go
further
have
australasia
cut
loose
from
the
british
empire
and
set
up
housekeeping
on
her
own
hook
it
seems
an
unwise
idea
they
point
to
the
united
states
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
lack
a
good
deal
of
being
alike
australasia
governs
herself
wholly
there
is
no
interference

her
commerce
and

are
not

i
was
in
cairo
years
ago
that
was
oriental
but
there
was
a
lack
when
you
are
in
florida
or
new
orleans
you
are
in
the
south
that
is
granted

you
are
not
in

you
are

a
tempered
orient
an
orient
with
an
indefinite
something

that
feeling
was
not
present
in
ceylon
ceylon
was
oriental
in
the
last
measure
of
completeness
utterly
oriental
also
utterly
tropical
and
indeed
to
one's
unreasoning
spiritual
sense
the
two
things
belong
together
all
the
requisites
were
present
the
costumes
were
right
the
black
and
brown
exposures
unconscious
of
immodesty
were
right
the
juggler
was
there
with
his
basket
his
snakes
his
mongoose
and
his
arrangements
for
growing
a
tree
from
seed
to
foliage
and
ripe
fruitage
before
one's
eyes
in
sight
were
plants
and
flowers
familiar
to
one
on
books
but
in
no
other
way
celebrated
desirable
strange
but
in
production
restricted
to
the
hot
belt
of
the
equator
and
out
a
little
way
in
the
country
were
the
proper
deadly
snakes
and
fierce
beasts
of
prey
and
the
wild
elephant
and
the
monkey
and
there
was
that
swoon
in
the
air
which
one
associates
with
the
tropics
and
that
smother
of
heat
heavy
with
odors
of
unknown
flowers
and
that
sudden
invasion
of
purple
gloom
fissured
with
lightnings
then
the
tumult
of
crashing
thunder
and
the
downpour
and
presently
all
sunny
and
smiling
again
all
these
things
were
there
the
conditions
were
complete
nothing
was
lacking
and
away
off
in
the
deeps
of
the
jungle
and
in
the
remotenesses
of
the
mountains
were
the
ruined
cities
and
mouldering
temples
mysterious
relics
of
the
pomps
of
a
forgotten
time
and
a
vanished
race
and
this
was
as
it
should
be
also
for
nothing
is
quite
satisfyingly
oriental
that
lacks
the
somber
and
impressive
qualities
of
mystery
and
antiquity
the
drive
through
the
town
and
out
to
the
galle
face
by
the
seashore
what
a
dream
it
was
of
tropical
splendors
of
bloom
and
blossom
and
oriental
conflagrations
of
costume!
the
walking
groups
of
men
women
boys
girls
babies
each
individual
was
a
flame
each
group
a
house
afire
for
color
and
such
stunning
colors
such
intensely
vivid
colors
such
rich
and
exquisite
minglings
and
fusings
of
rainbows
and
lightnings!
and
all
harmonious
all
in
perfect
taste
never
a
discordant
note
never
a
color
on
any
person
swearing
at
another
color
on
him
or
failing
to
harmonize
faultlessly
with
the
colors
of
any
group
the
wearer
might
join
the
stuffs
were
silk
thin
soft
delicate
clinging
and
as
a
rule
each
piece
a
solid
color
a
splendid
green
a
splendid
blue
a
splendid
yellow
a
splendid
purple
a
splendid
ruby
deep
and
rich
with
smouldering
fires
they
swept
continuously
by
in
crowds
and
legions
and
multitudes
glowing
flashing
burning
radiant
and
every
five
seconds
came
a
burst
of
blinding
red
that
made
a
body
catch
his
breath
and
filled
his
heart
with
joy
and
then
the
unimaginable
grace
of
those
costumes!
sometimes
a
woman's
whole
dress
was
but
a
scarf
wound
about
her
person
and
her
head
sometimes
a
man's
was
but
a
turban
and
a
careless
rag
or
two
in
both
cases
generous
areas
of
polished
dark
skin
showing
but
always
the
arrangement
compelled
the
homage
of
the
eye
and
made
the
heart
sing
for
gladness
i
can
see
it
to
this
day
that
radiant
panorama
that
wilderness
of
rich
color
that
incomparable
dissolving
view
of
harmonious
tints
and
lithe
half
covered
forms
and
beautiful
brown
faces
and
gracious
and
graceful
gestures
and
attitudes
and
movements
free
unstudied
barren
of
stiffness
and
restraint
and
just
then
into
this
dream
of
fairyland
and
paradise
a
grating
dissonance
was
injected
out
of
a
missionary
school
came
marching
two
and
two
sixteen
prim
and
pious
little
christian
black
girls
europeanly
clothed
dressed
to
the
last
detail
as
they
would
have
been
dressed
on
a
summer
sunday
in
an
english
or
american
village
those
clothes
oh
they
were
unspeakably
ugly!
ugly
barbarous
destitute
of
taste
destitute
of
grace
repulsive
as
a
shroud
i
looked
at
my
womenfolk's
clothes
just
full
grown
duplicates
of
the
outrages
disguising
those
poor
little
abused
creatures
and
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
the
street
with
them
then
i
looked
at
my
own
clothes
and
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
the
street
with
myself
however
we
must
put
up
with
our
clothes
as
they
are
they
have
their
reason
for
existing
they
are
on
us
to
expose
us
to
advertise
what
we
wear
them
to
conceal
they
are
a
sign
a
sign
of
insincerity
a
sign
of
suppressed
vanity
a
pretense
that
we
despise
gorgeous
colors
and
the
graces
of
harmony
and
form
and
we
put
them
on
to
propagate
that
lie
and
back
it
up
but
we
do
not
deceive
our
neighbor
and
when
we
step
into
ceylon
we
realize
that
we
have
not
even
deceived
ourselves
we
do
love
brilliant
colors
and
graceful
costumes
and
at
home
we
will
turn
out
in
a
storm
to
see
them
when
the
procession
goes
by
and
envy
the
wearers
we
go
to
the
theater
to
look
at
them
and
grieve
that
we
can't
be
clothed
like
that
we
go
to
the
king's
ball
when
we
get
a
chance
and
are
glad
of
a
sight
of
the
splendid
uniforms
and
the
glittering
orders
when
we
are
granted
permission
to
attend
an
imperial
drawing
room
we
shut
ourselves
up
in

and
due

bombay!
a
bewitching
place
a
bewildering
place
an
enchanting
place
the
arabian
nights
come
again
it
is
a
vast
city
contains
about
a
million
inhabitants
natives
they
are
with
a
slight
sprinkling
of
white
people
not
enough
to
have
the
slightest
modifying
effect
upon
the
massed
dark
complexion
of
the
public
it
is
winter
here
yet
the
weather
is
the
divine
weather
of
june
and
the
foliage
is
the
fresh
and
heavenly
foliage
of
june
there
is
a
rank
of
noble
great
shade
trees
across
the
way
from
the
hotel
and
under
them
sit
groups
of
picturesque
natives
of
both
sexes
and
the
juggler
in
his
turban
is
there
with
his
snakes
and
his
magic
and
all
day
long
the
cabs
and
the
multitudinous
varieties
of
costumes
flock
by
it
does
not
seem
as
if
one
could
ever
get
tired
of
watching
this
moving
show
this
shining
and
shifting
spectacle
in
the
great
bazar
the
pack
and
jam
of
natives
was
marvelous
the
sea
of
rich
colored
turbans
and
draperies
an
inspiring
sight
and
the
quaint
and
showy
indian
architecture
was
just
the
right
setting
for
it
toward
sunset
another
show
this
is
the
drive
around
the
sea
shore
to
malabar
point
where
lord
sandhurst
the
governor
of
the
bombay
presidency
lives
parsee
palaces
all
along
the
first
part
of
the
drive
and
past
them
all
the
world
is
driving
the
private
carriages
of
wealthy
englishmen
and
natives
of
rank
are
manned
by
a
driver
and
three
footmen
in
stunning
oriental
liveries
two
of
these
turbaned
statues
standing
up
behind
as
fine
as
monuments
sometimes
even
the
public
carriages
have
this
superabundant
crew
slightly
modified
one
to
drive
one
to
sit
by
and
see
it
done
and
one
to
stand
up
behind
and
yell
yell
when
there
is
anybody
in
the
way
and
for
practice
when
there
isn't
it
all
helps
to
keep
up
the
liveliness
and
augment
the
general
sense
of
swiftness
and
energy
and
confusion
and
pow
wow
in
the
region
of
scandal
point
felicitous
name
where
there
are
handy
rocks
to
sit
on
and
a
noble
view
of
the
sea
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
the
passing
and
reprising
whirl
and
tumult
of
gay
carriages
are
great
groups
of
comfortably
off
parsee
women
perfect
flower
beds
of
brilliant
color
a
fascinating
spectacle
tramp
tramp
tramping
along
the
road
in
singles
couples
groups
and
gangs
you
have
the
working
man
and
the
working
woman
but
not
clothed
like
ours
usually
the
man
is
a
nobly
built
great
athlete
with
not
a
rag
on
but
his
loin
handkerchief
his
color
a
deep
dark
brown
his
skin
satin
his
rounded
muscles
knobbing
it
as
if
it
had
eggs
under
it
usually
the
woman
is
a
slender
and
shapely
creature
as
erect
as
a
lightning
rod
and
she
has
but
one
thing
on
a
bright
colored
piece
of
stuff
which
is
wound
about
her
head
and
her
body
down
nearly
half
way
to
her
knees
and
which
clings
like
her
own
skin
her
legs
and
feet
are
bare
and
so
are
her
arms
except
for
her
fanciful
bunches
of
loose
silver
rings
on
her
ankles
and
on
her
arms
she
has
jewelry
bunched
on
the
side
of
her
nose
also
and
showy
clusterings
on
her
toes
when
she
undresses
for
bed
she
takes
off
her
jewelry
i
suppose
if
she
took
off
anything
more
she
would
catch
cold
as
a
rule
she
has
a
large
shiney
brass
water
jar
of
graceful
shape
on
her
head
and
one
of
her
naked
arms
curves
up
and
the
hand
holds
it
there
she
is
so
straight
so
erect
and
she
steps
with
such
style
and
such
easy
grace
and
dignity
and
her
curved
arm
and
her
brazen
jar
are
such
a
help
to
the
picture
indeed
our
working
women
cannot
begin
with
her
as
a
road
decoration
it
is
all
color
bewitching
color
enchanting
color
everywhere
all
around
all
the
way
around
the
curving
great
opaline
bay
clear
to
government
house
where
the
turbaned
big
native
'chuprassies'
stand
grouped
in
state
at
the
door
in
their
robes
of
fiery
red
and
do
most
properly
and
stunningly
finish
up
the
splendid
show
and
make
it
theatrically
complete
i
wish
i
were
a
'chuprassy'

the

that
all

desire

by

a

would
not
give
that
glimpse
for
the
shows
of
all
the
rest
of
the
globe
combined
even
now
after
the
lapse
of
a
year
the
delirium
of
those
days
in
bombay
has
not
left
me
and
i
hope
never
will
it
was
all
new
no
detail
of
it
hackneyed
and
india
did
not
wait
for
morning
it
began
at
the
hotel
straight
away
the
lobbies
and
halls
were
full
of
turbaned
and
fez'd
and
embroidered
cap'd
and
barefooted
and
cotton
clad
dark
natives
some
of
them
rushing
about
others
at
rest
squatting
or
sitting
on
the
ground
some
of
them
chattering
with
energy
others
still
and
dreamy
in
the
dining
room
every
man's
own
private
native
servant
standing
behind
his
chair
and
dressed
for
a
part
in
the
arabian
nights
our
rooms
were
high
up
on
the
front
a
white
man
he
was
a
burly
german
went
up
with
us
and
brought
three
natives
along
to
see
to
arranging
things
about
fourteen
others
followed
in
procession
with
the
hand
baggage
each
carried
an
article
and
only
one
a
bag
in
some
cases
in
other
cases
less
one
strong
native
carried
my
overcoat
another
a
parasol
another
a
box
of
cigars
another
a
novel
and
the
last
man
in
the
procession
had
no
load
but
a
fan
it
was
all
done
with
earnestness
and
sincerity
there
was
not
a
smile
in
the
procession
from
the
head
of
it
to
the
tail
of
it
each
man
waited
patiently
tranquilly
in
no
sort
of
hurry
till
one
of
us
found
time
to
give
him
a
copper
then
he
bent
his
head
reverently
touched
his
forehead
with
his
fingers
and
went
his
way
they
seemed
a
soft
and
gentle
race
and
there
was
something
both
winning
and
touching
about
their
demeanor
there
was
a
vast
glazed
door
which
opened
upon
the
balcony
it
needed
closing
or
cleaning
or
something
and
a
native
got
down
on
his
knees
and
went
to
work
at
it
he
seemed
to
be
doing
it
well
enough
but
perhaps
he
wasn't
for
the
burly
german
put
on
a
look
that
betrayed
dissatisfaction
then
without
explaining
what
was
wrong
gave
the
native
a
brisk
cuff
on
the
jaw
and
then
told
him
where
the
defect
was
it
seemed
such
a
shame
to
do
that
before
us
all
the
native
took
it
with
meekness
saying
nothing
and
not
showing
in
his
face
or
manner
any
resentment
i
had
not
seen
the
like
of
this
for
fifty
years
it
carried
me
back
to
my
boyhood
and
flashed
upon
me
the
forgotten
fact
that
this
was
the
usual
way
of
explaining
one's
desires
to
a
slave
i
was
able
to
remember
that
the
method
seemed
right
and
natural
to
me
in
those
days
i
being
born
to
it
and
unaware
that
elsewhere
there
were
other
methods
but
i
was
also
able
to
remember
that
those
unresented
cuffings
made
me
sorry
for
the
victim
and
ashamed
for
the
punisher
my
father
was
a
refined
and
kindly
gentleman
very
grave
rather
austere
of
rigid
probity
a
sternly
just
and
upright
man
albeit
he
attended
no
church
and
never
spoke
of
religious
matters
and
had
no
part
nor
lot
in
the
pious
joys
of
his
presbyterian
family
nor
ever
seemed
to
suffer
from
this
deprivation
he
laid
his
hand
upon
me
in
punishment
only
twice
in
his
life
and
then
not
heavily
once
for
telling
him
a
lie
which
surprised
me
and
showed
me
how
unsuspicious
he
was
for
that
was
not
my
maiden
effort
he
punished
me
those
two
times
only
and
never
any
other
member
of
the
family
at
all
yet
every
now
and
then
he
cuffed
our
harmless
slave
boy
lewis
for
trifling
little
blunders
and
awkwardnesses
my
father
had
passed
his
life
among
the
slaves
from
his
cradle
up
and
his
cuffings
proceeded
from
the
custom
of
the
time
not
from
his
nature
when
i
was
ten
years
old
i
saw
a
man
fling
a
lump
of
iron
ore
at
a
slaveman
in
anger
for
merely
doing
something
awkwardly
as
if
that
were
a
crime
it
bounded
from
the
man's
skull
and
the
man
fell
and
never
spoke
again
he
was
dead
in
an
hour
i
knew
the
man
had
a
right
to
kill
his
slave
if
he
wanted
to
and
yet
it
seemed
a
pitiful
thing
and
somehow
wrong
though
why
wrong
i
was
not
deep
enough
to
explain
if
i
had
been
asked
to
do
it
nobody
in
the
village
approved
of
that
murder
but
of
course
no
one
said
much
about
it
it
is
curious
the
space
annihilating
power
of
thought
for
just
one
second
all
that
goes
to
make
the
me
in
me
was
in
a
missourian
village
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
vividly
seeing
again
these
forgotten
pictures
of
fifty
years
ago
and
wholly
unconscious
of
all
things
but
just
those
and
in
the
next
second
i
was
back
in
bombay
and
that
kneeling
native's
smitten
cheek
was
not
done
tingling
yet!
back
to
boyhood
fifty
years
back
to
age
again
another
fifty
and
a
flight
equal
to
the
circumference
of
the
globe
all
in
two
seconds
by
the
watch!
some
natives
i
don't
remember
how
many
went
into
my
bedroom
now
and
put
things
to
rights
and
arranged
the
mosquito
bar
and
i
went
to
bed
to
nurse
my
cough
it
was
about
nine
in
the
evening
what
a
state
of
things!
for
three
hours
the
yelling
and
shouting
of
natives
in
the
hall
continued
along
with
the
velvety
patter
of
their
swift
bare
feet
what
a
racket
it
was!
they
were
yelling
orders
and
messages
down
three
flights
why
in
the
matter
of
noise
it
amounted
to
a
riot
an
insurrection
a
revolution
and
then
there
were
other
noises
mixed
up
with
these
and
at
intervals
tremendously
accenting
them
roofs
falling
in
i
judged
windows
smashing
persons
being
murdered
crows
squawking
and
deriding
and
cursing
canaries
screeching
monkeys
jabbering
macaws
blaspheming
and
every
now
and
then
fiendish
bursts
of
laughter
and
explosions
of
dynamite
by
midnight
i
had
suffered
all
the
different
kinds
of
shocks
there
are
and
knew
that
i
could
never
more
be
disturbed
by
them
either
isolated
or
in
combination
then
came
peace
stillness
deep
and
solemn
and
lasted
till
five
then
it
all
broke
loose
again
and
who
re
started
it
the
bird
of
birds
the
indian
crow
i
came
to
know
him
well
by
and
by
and
be
infatuated
with
him
i
suppose
he
is
the
hardest
lot
that
wears
feathers
yes
and
the
cheerfulest
and
the
best
satisfied
with
himself
he
never
arrived
at
what
he
is
by
any
careless
process
or
any
sudden
one
he
is
a
work
of
art
and
art
is
long
he
is
the
product
of
immemorial
ages
and
of
deep
calculation
one
can't
make
a
bird
like
that
in
a
day
he
has
been
reincarnated
more
times
than
shiva
and
he
has
kept
a
sample
of
each
incarnation
and
fused
it
into
his
constitution
in
the
course
of
his
evolutionary
promotions
his
sublime
march
toward
ultimate
perfection
he
has
been
a
gambler
a
low
comedian
a
dissolute
priest
a
fussy
woman
a
blackguard
a
scoffer
a
liar
a
thief
a
spy
an
informer
a
trading
politician
a
swindler
a
professional
hypocrite
a
patriot
for
cash
a
reformer
a
lecturer
a
lawyer
a
conspirator
a
rebel
a
royalist
a
democrat
a
practicer
and
propagator
of
irreverence
a
meddler
an
intruder
a
busybody
an
infidel
and
a
wallower
in
sin
for
the
mere
love
of
it
the
strange
result
the
incredible
result
of
this
patient
accumulation
of
all
damnable
traits
is
that
be
does
not
know
what
care
is
he
does
not
know
what
sorrow
is
he
does
not
know
what
remorse
is
his
life
is
one
long
thundering
ecstasy
of
happiness
and
he
will
go
to
his
death
untroubled
knowing
that
he
will
soon
turn
up
again
as
an
author
or
something
and
be
even
more
intolerably
capable
and
comfortable
than
ever
he
was
before
in
his
straddling
wide
forward
step
and
his
springy
side
wise
series
of
hops
and
his
impudent
air
and
his
cunning
way
of
canting
his
head
to
one
side
upon
occasion
he
reminds
one
of
the
american
blackbird
but
the
sharp
resemblances
stop
there
he
is
much
bigger
than
the
blackbird
and
he
lacks
the
blackbird's
trim
and
slender
and
beautiful
build
and
shapely
beak
and
of
course
his
sober
garb
of
gray
and
rusty
black
is
a
poor
and
humble
thing
compared
with
the
splendid
lustre
of
the
blackbird's
metallic
sables
and
shifting
and
flashing
bronze
glories
the
blackbird
is
a
perfect
gentleman
in
deportment
and
attire
and
is
not
noisy
i
believe
except
when
holding
religious
services
and
political
conventions
in
a
tree
but
this
indian
sham
quaker
is
just
a
rowdy
and
is
always
noisy
when
awake
always
chaffing
scolding
scoffing
laughing
ripping
and
cursing
and
carrying
on
about
something
or
other
i
never
saw
such
a
bird
for
delivering
opinions
nothing
escapes
him
he
notices
everything
that
happens
and
brings
out
his
opinion
about
it
particularly
if
it
is
a
matter
that
is
none
of
his
business
and
it
is
never
a
mild
opinion
but
always
violent
violent
and
profane
the
presence
of
ladies
does
not
affect
him
his
opinions
are
not
the
outcome
of
reflection
for
he
never
thinks
about
anything
but
heaves
out
the
opinion
that
is
on
top
in
his
mind
and
which
is
often
an
opinion
about
some
quite
different
thing
and
does
not
fit
the
case
but
that
is
his
way
his
main
idea
is
to
get
out
an
opinion
and
if
he
stopped
to
think
he
would
lose
chances
i
suppose
he
has
no
enemies
among
men
the
whites
and
mohammedans
never
seemed
to
molest
him
and
the
hindoos
because
of
their
religion
never
take
the
life
of
any
creature
but
spare
even
the
snakes
and
tigers
and
fleas
and
rats
if
i
sat
on
one
end
of
the
balcony
the
crows
would
gather
on
the
railing
at
the
other
end
and
talk
about
me
and
edge
closer
little
by
little
till
i
could
almost
reach
them
and
they
would
sit
there
in
the
most
unabashed
way
and
talk
about
my
clothes
and
my
hair
and
my
complexion
and
probable
character
and
vocation
and
politics
and
how
i
came
to
be
in
india
and
what
i
had
been
doing
and
how
many
days
i
had
got
for
it
and
how
i
had
happened
to
go
unhanged
so
long
and
when
would
it
probably
come
off
and
might
there
be
more
of
my
sort
where
i
came
from
and
when
would
they
be
hanged
and
so
on
and
so
on
until
i
could
not
longer
endure
the
embarrassment
of
it
then
i
would
shoo
them
away
and
they
would
circle
around
in
the
air
a
little
while
laughing
and
deriding
and
mocking
and
presently
settle
on
the
rail
and
do
it
all
over
again
they
were
very
sociable
when
there
was
anything
to
eat
oppressively
so
with
a
little
encouragement
they
would
come
in
and
light
on
the
table
and
help
me
eat
my
breakfast
and
once
when
i
was
in
the
other
room
and
they
found
themselves
alone
they
carried
off
everything
they
could
lift
and
they
were
particular
to
choose
things
which
they
could
make
no
use
of
after
they
got
them
in
india
their
number
is
beyond
estimate
and
their
noise
is
in
proportion
i
suppose
they
cost
the
country
more
than
the
government
does
yet
that
is
not
a
light
matter
still
they
pay
their
company
pays
it
would
sadden
the
land
to
take
their
cheerful
voice

it

i
don't
remember
any
of

now
but
john
w
and
the
romances
connected
with
those
princely
native
houses
to
this
day
they
are
always
turning
up
just
as
in
the
old
old
times
they
were
sweating
out
a
romance
in
an
english
court
in
bombay
a
while
before
we
were
there
in
this
case
a
native
prince
16
1/2
years
old
who
has
been
enjoying
his
titles
and
dignities
and
estates
unmolested
for
fourteen
years
is
suddenly
haled
into
court
on
the
charge
that
he
is
rightfully
no
prince
at
all
but
a
pauper
peasant
that
the
real
prince
died
when
two
and
one
half
years
old
that
the
death
was
concealed
and
a
peasant
child
smuggled
into
the
royal
cradle
and
that
this
present
incumbent
was
that
smuggled
substitute
this
is
the
very
material
that
so
many
oriental
tales
have
been
made
of
the
case
of
that
great
prince
the
gaikwar
of
baroda
is
a
reversal
of
the
theme
when
that
throne
fell
vacant
no
heir
could
be
found
for
some
time
but
at
last
one
was
found
in
the
person
of
a
peasant
child
who
was
making
mud
pies
in
a
village
street
and
having
an
innocent
good
time
but
his
pedigree
was
straight
he
was
the
true
prince
and
he
has
reigned
ever
since
with
none
to
dispute
his
right
lately
there
was
another
hunt
for
an
heir
to
another
princely
house
and
one
was
found
who
was
circumstanced
about
as
the
gaikwar
had
been
his
fathers
were
traced
back
in
humble
life
along
a
branch
of
the
ancestral
tree
to
the
point
where
it
joined
the
stem
fourteen
generations
ago
and
his
heirship
was
thereby
squarely
established
the
tracing
was
done
by
means
of
the
records
of
one
of
the
great
hindoo
shrines
where
princes
on
pilgrimage
record
their
names
and
the
date
of
their
visit
this
is
to
keep
the
prince's
religious
account
straight
and
his
spiritual
person
safe
but
the
record
has
the
added
value
of
keeping
the
pedigree
authentic
too
when
i
think
of
bombay
now
at
this
distance
of
time
i
seem
to
have
a
kaleidoscope
at
my
eye
and
i
hear
the
clash
of
the
glass
bits
as
the
splendid
figures
change
and
fall
apart
and
flash
into
new
forms
figure
after
figure
and
with
the
birth
of
each
new
form
i
feel
my
skin
crinkle
and
my
nerve
web
tingle
with
a
new
thrill
of
wonder
and
delight
these
remembered
pictures
float
past
me
in
a
sequence
of
contracts
following
the
same
order
always
and
always
whirling
by
and
disappearing
with
the
swiftness
of
a
dream
leaving
me
with
the
sense
that
the
actuality
was
the
experience
of
an
hour
at
most
whereas
it
really
covered
days
i
think
the
series
begins
with
the
hiring
of
a
bearer
native
man
servant
a
person
who
should
be
selected
with
some
care
because
as
long
as
he
is
in
your
employ
he
will
be
about
as
near
to
you
as
your
clothes
in
india
your
day
may
be
said
to
begin
with
the
bearer's
knock
on
the
bedroom
door
accompanied
by
a
formula
of
words
a
formula
which
is
intended
to
mean
that
the
bath
is
ready
it
doesn't
really
seem
to
mean
anything
at
all
but
that
is
because
you
are
not
used
to
bearer
english
you
will
presently
understand
where
he
gets
his
english
is
his
own
secret
there
is
nothing
like
it
elsewhere
in
the
earth
or
even
in
paradise
perhaps
but
the
other
place
is
probably
full
of
it
you
hire
him
as
soon
as
you
touch
indian
soil
for
no
matter
what
your
sex
is
you
cannot
do
without
him
he
is
messenger
valet
chambermaid
table
waiter
lady's
maid
courier
he
is
everything
he
carries
a
coarse
linen
clothes
bag
and
a
quilt
he
sleeps
on
the
stone
floor
outside
your
chamber
door
and
gets
his
meals
you
do
not
know
where
nor
when
you
only
know
that
he
is
not
fed
on
the
premises
either
when
you
are
in
a
hotel
or
when
you
are
a
guest
in
a
private
house
his
wages
are
large
from
an
indian
point
of
view
and
he
feeds
and
clothes
himself
out
of
them
we
had
three
of
him
in
two
and
a
half
months
the
first
one's
rate
was
thirty
rupees
a
month
that
is
to
say
twenty
seven
cents
a
day
the
rate
of
the
others
rs
40
40
rupees
a
month
a
princely
sum
for
the
native
switchman
on
a
railway
and
the
native
servant
in
a
private
family
get
only
rs
7
per
month
and
the
farm
hand
only
4
the
two
former
feed
and
clothe
themselves
and
their
families
on
their
$1
90
per
month
but
i
cannot
believe
that
the
farmhand
has
to
feed
himself
on
his
$1
08
i
think
the
farm
probably
feeds
him
and
that
the
whole
of
his
wages
except
a
trifle
for
the
priest
go
to
the
support
of
his
family
that
is
to
the
feeding
of
his
family
for
they
live
in
a
mud
hut
hand
made
and
doubtless
rent
free
and
they
wear
no
clothes
at
least
nothing
more
than
a
rag
and
not
much
of
a
rag
at
that
in
the
case
of
the
males
however
these
are
handsome
times
for
the
farm
hand
he
was
not
always
the
child
of
luxury
that
he
is
now
the
chief
commissioner
of
the
central
provinces
in
a
recent
official
utterance
wherein
he
was
rebuking
a
native
deputation
for
complaining
of
hard
times
reminded
them
that
they
could
easily
remember
when
a
farm
hand's
wages
were
only
half
a
rupee
former
value
a
month
that
is
to
say
less
than
a
cent
a
day
nearly
$2
90
a
year
if
such
a
wage
earner
had
a
good
deal
of
a
family
and
they
all
have
that
for
god
is
very
good
to
these
poor
natives
in
some
ways
he
would
save
a
profit
of
fifteen
cents
clean
and
clear
out
of
his
year's
toil
i
mean
a
frugal
thrifty
person
would
not
one
given
to
display
and
ostentation
and
if
he
owed
$13
50
and
took
good
care
of
his
health
he
could
pay
it
off
in
ninety
years
then
he
could
hold
up
his
head
and
look
his
creditors
in
the
face
again
think
of
these
facts
and
what
they
mean
india
does
not
consist
of
cities
there
are
no
cities
in
india
to
speak
of
its
stupendous
population
consists
of
farm
laborers
india
is
one
vast
farm
one
almost
interminable
stretch
of
fields
with
mud
fences
between
think
of
the
above
facts
and
consider
what
an
incredible
aggregate
of
poverty
they
place
before
you
the
first
bearer
that
applied
waited
below
and
sent
up
his
recommendations
that
was
the
first
morning
in
bombay
we
read
them
over
carefully
cautiously
thoughtfully
there
was
not
a
fault
to
find
with
them
except
one
they
were
all
from
americans
is
that
a
slur
if
it
is
it
is
a
deserved
one
in
my
experience
an
american's
recommendation
of
a
servant
is
not
usually
valuable
we
are
too
good
natured
a
race
we
hate
to
say
the
unpleasant
thing
we
shrink
from
speaking
the
unkind
truth
about
a
poor
fellow
whose
bread
depends
upon
our
verdict
so
we
speak
of
his
good
points
only
thus
not
scrupling
to
tell
a
lie
a
silent
lie
for
in
not
mentioning
his
bad
ones
we
as
good
as
say
he
hasn't
any
the
only
difference
that
i
know
of
between
a
silent
lie
and
a
spoken
one
is
that
the
silent
lie
is
a
less
respectable
one
than
the
other
and
it
can
deceive
whereas
the
other
can't
as
a
rule
we
not
only
tell
the
silent
lie
as
to
a
servant's
faults
but
we
sin
in
another
way
we
overpraise
his
merits
for
when
it
comes
to
writing
recommendations
of
servants
we
are
a
nation
of
gushers
and
we
have
not
the
frenchman's
excuse
in
france
you
must
give
the
departing
servant
a
good
recommendation
and
you
must
conceal
his
faults
you
have
no
choice
if
you
mention
his
faults
for
the
protection
of
the
next
candidate
for
his
services
he
can
sue
you
for
damages
and
the
court
will
award
them
too
and
moreover
the
judge
will
give
you
a
sharp
dressing
down
from
the
bench
for
trying
to
destroy
a
poor
man's
character
and
rob
him
of
his
bread
i
do
not
state
this
on
my
own
authority
i
got
it
from
a
french
physician
of
fame
and
repute
a
man
who
was
born
in
paris
and
had
practiced
there
all
his
life
and
he
said
that
he
spoke
not
merely
from
common
knowledge
but
from
exasperating
personal
experience
as
i
was
saying
the
bearer's
recommendations
were
all
from
american
tourists
and
st
peter
would
have
admitted
him
to
the
fields
of
the
blest
on
them
i
mean
if
he
is
as
unfamiliar
with
our
people
and
our
ways
as
i
suppose
he
is
according
to
these
recommendations
manuel
x
was
supreme
in
all
the
arts
connected
with
his
complex
trade
and
these
manifold
arts
were
mentioned
and
praised
in
detail
his
english
was
spoken
of
in
terms
of
warm
admiration
admiration
verging
upon
rapture
i
took
pleased
note
of
that
and
hoped
that
some
of
it
might
be
true
we
had
to
have
some
one
right
away
so
the
family
went
down
stairs
and
took
him
a
week
on
trial
then
sent
him
up
to
me
and
departed
on
their
affairs
i
was
shut
up
in
my
quarters
with
a
bronchial
cough
and
glad
to
have
something
fresh
to
look
at
something
new
to
play
with
manuel
filled
the
bill
manuel
was
very
welcome
he
was
toward
fifty
years
old
tall
slender
with
a
slight
stoop
an
artificial
stoop
a
deferential
stoop
a
stoop
rigidified
by
long
habit
with
face
of
european
mould
short
hair
intensely
black
gentle
black
eyes
timid
black
eyes
indeed
complexion
very
dark
nearly
black
in
fact
face
smooth
shaven
he
was
bareheaded
and
barefooted
and
was
never
otherwise
while
his
week
with
us
lasted
his
clothing
was
european
cheap
flimsy
and
showed
much
wear
he
stood
before
me
and
inclined
his
head
and
body
in
the
pathetic
indian
way
touching
his
forehead
with
the
finger
ends
of
his
right
hand
in
salute
i
said
manuel
you
are
evidently
indian
but
you
seem
to
have
a
spanish
name
when
you
put
it
all
together
how
is
that
a
perplexed
look
gathered
in
his
face
it
was
plain
that
he
had
not
understood
but
he
didn't
let
on
he
spoke
back
placidly
name
manuel
yes
master
i
know
but
how
did
you
get
the
name
oh
yes
i
suppose
think
happen
so
father
same
name
not
mother
i
saw
that
i
must
simplify
my
language
and
spread
my
words
apart
if
i
would
be
understood
by
this
english
scholar
well
then
how
did
your
father
get
his
name
oh
he
brightening
a
little
he
christian
portygee
live
in
goa
i
born
goa
mother
not

too
same
like

christian
brahmin
master
salvation
army
all
this
haltingly
and
with
difficulty
then
he
had
an
inspiration
and
began
to
pour
out
a
flood
of
words
that
i
could
make
nothing
of
so
i
said
there
don't
do
that
i
can't
understand
hindostani
not
hindostani
master
english
always
i
speaking
english
sometimes
when
i
talking
every
day
all
the
time
at
you
very
well
stick
to
that
that
is
intelligible
it
is
not
up
to
my
hopes
it
is
not
up
to
the
promise
of
the
recommendations
still
it
is
english
and
i
understand
it
don't
elaborate
it
i
don't
like
elaborations
when
they
are
crippled
by
uncertainty
of
touch
master
oh
never
mind
it
was
only
a
random
thought
i
didn't
expect
you
to
understand
it
how
did
you
get
your
english
is
it
an
acquirement
or
just

a
plenty

i

it
up

something
at

all
good

me

me

good
then
he
had
another
inspiration
and
went
rambling
off
into
fervent
confusions
and
incoherencies
and
i
had
to
stop
him
again
i
thought
we
had
talked
enough
so
i
told
him
to
go
to
the
bathroom
and
clean
it
up
and
remove
the
slops
this
to
get
rid
of
him
he
went
away
seeming
to
understand
and
got
out
some
of
my
clothes
and
began
to
brush
them
i
repeated
my
desire
several
times
simplifying
and
re
simplifying
it
and
at
last
he
got
the
idea
then
he
went
away
and
put
a
coolie
at
the
work
and
explained
that
he
would
lose
caste
if
he
did
it
himself
it
would
be
pollution
by
the
law
of
his
caste
and
it
would
cost
him
a
deal
of
fuss
and
trouble
to
purify
himself
and
accomplish
his
rehabilitation
he
said
that
that
kind
of
work
was
strictly
forbidden
to
persons
of
caste
and
as
strictly
restricted
to
the
very
bottom
layer
of
hindoo
society
the
despised
'sudra'
the
toiler
the
laborer
he
was
right
and
apparently
the
poor
sudra
has
been
content
with
his
strange
lot
his
insulting
distinction
for
ages
and
ages
clear
back
to
the
beginning
of
things
so
to
speak
buckle
says
that
his
name
laborer
is
a
term
of
contempt
that
it
is
ordained
by
the
institutes
of
menu

b
c
that
if
a
sudra
sit
on
a
level
with
his
superior
he
shall
be
exiled
or
branded

particulars
i
will
remark
that
as

if
he
speak
contemptuously
of
his
superior
or
insult
him
he
shall
suffer
death
if
he
listen
to
the
reading
of
the
sacred

he
shall

that
it

creators

manuel
was
a
failure
poor
old
fellow
his
age
was
against
him
he
was
desperately
slow
and
phenomenally
forgetful
when
he
went
three
blocks
on
an
errand
he
would
be
gone
two
hours
and
then
forget
what
it
was
he
went
for
when
he
packed
a
trunk
it
took
him
forever
and
the
trunk's
contents
were
an
unimaginable
chaos
when
he
got
done
he
couldn't
wait
satisfactorily
at
table
a
prime
defect
for
if
you
haven't
your
own
servant
in
an
indian
hotel
you
are
likely
to
have
a
slow
time
of
it
and
go
away
hungry
we
couldn't
understand
his
english
he
couldn't
understand
ours
and
when
we
found
that
he
couldn't
understand
his
own
it
seemed
time
for
us
to
part
i
had
to
discharge
him
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
i
did
it
as
kindly
as
i
could
and
as
gently
we
must
part
said
i
but
i
hoped
we
should
meet
again
in
a
better
world
it
was
not
true
but
it
was
only
a
little
thing
to
say
and
saved
his
feelings
and
cost
me
nothing
but
now
that
he
was
gone
and
was
off
my
mind
and
heart
my
spirits
began
to
rise
at
once
and
i
was
soon
feeling
brisk
and
ready
to
go
out
and
have
adventures
then
his
newly
hired
successor
flitted
in
touched
his
forehead
and
began
to
fly
around
here
there
and
everywhere
on
his
velvet
feet
and
in
five
minutes
he
had
everything
in
the
room
ship
shape
and
bristol
fashion
as
the
sailors
say
and
was
standing
at
the
salute
waiting
for
orders
dear
me
what
a
rustler
he
was
after
the
slumbrous
way
of
manuel
poor
old
slug!
all
my
heart
all
my
affection
all
my
admiration
went
out
spontaneously
to
this
frisky
little
forked
black
thing
this
compact
and
compressed
incarnation
of
energy
and
force
and
promptness
and
celerity
and
confidence
this
smart
smily
engaging
shiney
eyed
little
devil
feruled
on
his
upper
end
by
a
gleaming
fire
coal
of
a
fez
with
a
red
hot
tassel
dangling
from
it
i
said
with
deep
satisfaction
you'll
suit
what
is
your
name
he
reeled
it
mellowly
off
let
me
see
if
i
can
make
a
selection
out
of
it
for
business
uses
i
mean
we
will
keep
the
rest
for
sundays
give
it
to
me
in
installments
he
did
it
but
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
short
ones
except
mousawhich
suggested
mouse
it
was
out
of
character
it
was
too
soft
too
quiet
too
conservative
it
didn't
fit
his
splendid
style
i
considered
and
said
mousa
is
short
enough
but
i
don't
quite
like
it
it
seems
colorless
inharmonious
inadequate
and
i
am
sensitive
to
such
things
how
do
you
think
satan
would
do
yes
master
satan
do
wair
good
it
was
his
way
of
saying
very
good
there
was
a
rap
at
the
door
satan
covered
the
ground
with
a
single
skip
there
was
a
word
or
two
of
hindostani
then
he
disappeared
three
minutes
later
he
was
before
me
again
militarily
erect
and
waiting
for
me
to
speak
first
what
is
it
satan
god
want
to
see
you
who
god
i
show
him
up
master
why
this
is
so
unusual
that
that
well
you
see
indeed
i
am
so
unprepared
i
don't
quite
know
what
i
do
mean
dear
me
can't
you
explain
don't
you
see
that
this
is
a
most
ex
here
his
card
master
wasn't
it
curious
and
amazing
and
tremendous
and
all
that
such
a
personage
going
around
calling
on
such
as
i
and
sending
up
his
card
like
a
mortal
sending
it
up
by
satan
it
was
a
bewildering
collision
of
the
impossibles
but
this
was
the
land
of
the
arabian
nights
this
was
india!
and
what
is
it
that
cannot
happen
in
india
we
had
the
interview
satan
was
right
the
visitor
was
indeed
a
god
in
the
conviction
of
his
multitudinous
followers
and
was
worshiped
by
them
in
sincerity
and
humble
adoration
they
are
troubled
by
no
doubts
as
to
his
divine
origin
and
office
they
believe
in
him
they
pray
to
him
they
make
offerings
to
him
they
beg
of
him
remission
of
sins
to
them
his
person
together
with
everything
connected
with
it
is
sacred
from
his
barber
they
buy
the
parings
of
his
nails
and
set
them
in
gold
and
wear
them
as
precious
amulets
i
tried
to
seem
tranquilly
conversational
and
at
rest
but
i
was
not
would
you
have
been
i
was
in
a
suppressed
frenzy
of
excitement
and
curiosity
and
glad
wonder
i
could
not
keep
my
eyes
off
him
i
was
looking
upon
a
god
an
actual
god
a
recognized
and
accepted
god
and
every
detail
of
his
person
and
his
dress
had
a
consuming
interest
for
me
and
the
thought
went
floating
through
my
head
he
is
worshiped
think
of
it
he
is
not
a
recipient
of
the
pale
homage
called
compliment
wherewith
the
highest
human
clay
must
make
shift
to
be
satisfied
but
of
an
infinitely
richer
spiritual
food
adoration
worship!
men
and
women
lay
their
cares
and
their
griefs
and
their
broken
hearts
at
his
feet
and
he
gives
them
his
peace
and
they
go
away
healed
and
just
then
the
awful
visitor
said
in
the
simplest
way
there
is
a
feature
of
the
philosophy
of
huck
finn
which
and
went
luminously
on
with
the
construction
of
a
compact
and
nicely
discriminated
literary
verdict
it
is
a
land
of
surprises
india!
i
had
had
my
ambitions
i
had
hoped
and
almost
expected
to
be
read
by
kings
and
presidents
and
emperors
but
i
had
never
looked
so
high
as
that
it
would
be
false
modesty
to
pretend
that
i
was
not
inordinately
pleased
i
was
i
was
much
more
pleased
than
i
should
have
been
with
a
compliment
from
a
man
he
remained
half
an
hour
and
i
found
him
a
most
courteous
and
charming
gentleman
the
godship
has
been
in
his
family
a
good
while
but
i
do
not
know
how
long
he
is
a
mohammedan
deity
by
earthly
rank
he
is
a
prince
not
an
indian
but
a
persian
prince
he
is
a
direct
descendant
of
the
prophet's
line
he
is
comely
also
young
for
a
god
not
forty
perhaps
not
above
thirty
five
years
old
he
wears
his
immense
honors
with
tranquil
brace
and
with
a
dignity
proper
to
his
awful
calling
he
speaks
english
with
the
ease
and
purity
of
a
person
born
to
it
i
think
i
am
not
overstating
this
he
was
the
only
god
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
was
very
favorably
impressed
when
he
rose
to
say
good
bye
the
door
swung
open
and
i
caught
the
flash
of
a
red
fez
and
heard
these
words
reverently
said
satan
see
god
out
yes
and
these
mis
mated
beings
passed
from
view
satan
in
the
lead
and
the
other
following
after
chapter
xl
few
of
us
can
stand
prosperity
another
man's
i
mean
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
the
next
picture
in
my
mind
is
government
house
on
malabar
point
with
the
wide
sea
view
from
the
windows
and
broad
balconies
abode
of
his
excellency
the
governor
of
the
bombay
presidency
a
residence
which
is
european
in
everything
but
the
native
guards
and
servants
and
is
a
home
and
a
palace
of
state
harmoniously
combined
that
was
england
the
english
power
the
english
civilization
the
modern
civilization
with
the
quiet
elegancies
and
quiet
colors
and
quiet
tastes
and
quiet
dignity
that
are
the
outcome
of
the
modern
cultivation
and
following
it
came
a
picture
of
the
ancient
civilization
of
india
an
hour
in
the
mansion
of
a
native
prince
kumar
schri
samatsinhji
bahadur
of
the
palitana
state
the
young
lad
his
heir
was
with
the
prince
also
the
lad's
sister
a
wee
brown
sprite
very
pretty
very
serious
very
winning
delicately
moulded
costumed
like
the
daintiest
butterfly
a
dear
little
fairyland
princess
gravely
willing
to
be
friendly
with
the
strangers
but
in
the
beginning
preferring
to
hold
her
father's
hand
until
she
could
take
stock
of
them
and
determine
how
far
they
were
to
be
trusted
she
must
have
been
eight
years
old
so
in
the
natural
indian
order
of
things
she
would
be
a
bride
in
three
or
four
years
from
now
and
then
this
free
contact
with
the
sun
and
the
air
and
the
other
belongings
of
out
door
nature
and
comradeship
with
visiting
male
folk
would
end
and
she
would
shut
herself
up
in
the
zenana
for
life
like
her
mother
and
by
inherited
habit
of
mind
would
be
happy
in
that
seclusion
and
not
look
upon
it
as
an
irksome
restraint
and
a
weary
captivity
the
game
which
the
prince
amuses
his
leisure
with
however
never
mind
it
i
should
never
be
able
to
describe
it
intelligibly
i
tried
to
get
an
idea
of
it
while
my
wife
and
daughter
visited
the
princess
in
the
zenana
a
lady
of
charming
graces
and
a
fluent
speaker
of
english
but
i
did
not
make
it
out
it
is
a
complicated
game
and
i
believe
it
is
said
that
nobody
can
learn
to
play
it
well
but
an
indian
and
i
was
not
able
to
learn
how
to
wind
a
turban
it
seemed
a
simple
art
and
easy
but
that
was
a
deception
it
is
a
piece
of
thin
delicate
stuff
a
foot
wide
or
more
and
forty
or
fifty
feet
long
and
the
exhibitor
of
the
art
takes
one
end
of
it
in
his
hands
and
winds
it
in
and
out
intricately
about
his
head
twisting
it
as
he
goes
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
thing
is
finished
and
is
neat
and
symmetrical
and
fits
as
snugly
as
a
mould
we
were
interested
in
the
wardrobe
and
the
jewels
and
in
the
silverware
and
its
grace
of
shape
and
beauty
and
delicacy
of
ornamentation
the
silverware
is
kept
locked
up
except
at
meal
times
and
none
but
the
chief
butler
and
the
prince
have
keys
to
the
safe
i
did
not
clearly
understand
why
but
it
was
not
for
the
protection
of
the
silver
it
was
either
to
protect
the
prince
from
the
contamination
which
his
caste
would
suffer
if
the
vessels
were
touched
by
low
caste
hands
or
it
was
to
protect
his
highness
from
poison
possibly
it
was
both
i
believe
a
salaried
taster
has
to
taste
everything
before
the
prince
ventures
it
an
ancient
and
judicious
custom
in
the
east
and
has
thinned
out
the
tasters
a
good
deal
for
of
course
it
is
the
cook
that
puts
the
poison
in
if
i
were
an
indian
prince
i
would
not
go
to
the
expense
of
a
taster
i
would
eat
with
the
cook
ceremonials
are
always
interesting
and
i
noted
that
the
indian
good
morning
is
a
ceremonial
whereas
ours
doesn't
amount
to
that
in
salutation
the
son
reverently
touches
the
father's
forehead
with
a
small
silver
implement
tipped
with
vermillion
paste
which
leaves
a
red
spot
there
and
in
return
the
son
receives
the
father's
blessing
our
good
morning
is
well
enough
for
the
rowdy
west
perhaps
but
would
be
too
brusque
for
the
soft
and
ceremonious
east
after
being
properly
necklaced
according
to
custom
with
great
garlands
made
of
yellow
flowers
and
provided
with
betel
nut
to
chew
this
pleasant
visit
closed
and
we
passed
thence
to
a
scene
of
a
different
sort
from
this
glow
of
color
and
this
sunny
life
to
those
grim
receptacles
of
the
parsee
dead
the
towers
of
silence
there
is
something
stately
about
that
name
and
an
impressiveness
which
sinks
deep
the
hush
of
death
is
in
it
we
have
the
grave
the
tomb
the
mausoleum
god's
acre
the
cemetery
and
association
has
made
them
eloquent
with
solemn
meaning
but
we
have
no
name
that
is
so
majestic
as
that
one
or
lingers
upon
the
ear
with
such
deep
and
haunting
pathos
on
lofty
ground
in
the
midst
of
a
paradise
of
tropical
foliage
and
flowers
remote
from
the
world
and
its
turmoil
and
noise
they
stood
the
towers
of
silence
and
away
below
was
spread
the
wide
groves
of
cocoa
palms
then
the
city
mile
on
mile
then
the
ocean
with
its
fleets
of
creeping
ships
all
steeped
in
a
stillness
as
deep
as
the
hush
that
hallowed
this
high
place
of
the
dead
the
vultures
were
there
they
stood
close
together
in
a
great
circle
all
around
the
rim
of
a
massive
low
tower
waiting
stood
as
motionless
as
sculptured
ornaments
and
indeed
almost
deceived
one
into
the
belief
that
that
was
what
they
were
presently
there
was
a
slight
stir
among
the
score
of
persons
present
and
all
moved
reverently
out
of
the
path
and
ceased
from
talking
a
funeral
procession
entered
the
great
gate
marching
two
and
two
and
moved
silently
by
toward
the
tower
the
corpse
lay
in
a
shallow
shell
and
was
under
cover
of
a
white
cloth
but
was
otherwise
naked
the
bearers
of
the
body
were
separated
by
an
interval
of
thirty
feet
from
the
mourners
they
and
also
the
mourners
were
draped
all
in
pure
white
and
each
couple
of
mourners
was
figuratively
bound
together
by
a
piece
of
white
rope
or
a
handkerchief
though
they
merely
held
the
ends
of
it
in
their
hands
behind
the
procession
followed
a
dog
which
was
led
in
a
leash
when
the
mourners
had
reached
the
neighborhood
of
the
tower
neither
they
nor
any
other
human
being
but
the
bearers
of
the
dead
must
approach
within
thirty
feet
of
it
they
turned
and
went
back
to
one
of
the
prayer
houses
within
the
gates
to
pray
for
the
spirit
of
their
dead
the
bearers
unlocked
the
tower's
sole
door
and
disappeared
from
view
within
in
a
little
while
they
came
out
bringing
the
bier
and
the
white
covering
cloth
and
locked
the
door
again
then
the
ring
of
vultures
rose
flapping
their
wings
and
swooped
down
into
the
tower
to
devour
the
body
nothing
was
left
of
it
but
a
clean
picked
skeleton
when
they
flocked
out
again
a
few
minutes
afterward
the
principle
which
underlies
and
orders
everything
connected
with
a
parsee
funeral
is
purity
by
the
tenets
of
the
zoroastrian
religion
the
elements
earth
fire
and
water
are
sacred
and
must
not
be
contaminated
by
contact
with
a
dead
body
hence
corpses
must
not
be
burned
neither
must
they
be
buried
none
may
touch
the
dead
or
enter
the
towers
where
they
repose
except
certain
men
who
are
officially
appointed
for
that
purpose
they
receive
high
pay
but
theirs
is
a
dismal
life
for
they
must
live
apart
from
their
species
because
their
commerce
with
the
dead
defiles
them
and
any
who
should
associate
with
them
would
share
their
defilement
when
they
come
out
of
the
tower
the
clothes
they
are
wearing
are
exchanged
for
others
in
a
building
within
the
grounds
and
the
ones
which
they
have
taken
off
are
left
behind
for
they
are
contaminated
and
must
never
be
used
again
or
suffered
to
go
outside
the
grounds
these
bearers
come
to
every
funeral
in
new
garments
so
far
as
is
known
no
human
being
other
than
an
official
corpse
bearer
save
one
has
ever
entered
a
tower
of
silence
after
its
consecration
just
a
hundred
years
ago
a
european
rushed
in
behind
the
bearers
and
fed
his
brutal
curiosity
with
a
glimpse
of
the
forbidden
mysteries
of
the
place
this
shabby
savage's
name
is
not
given
his
quality
is
also
concealed
these
two
details
taken
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
for
his
extraordinary
offense
the
only
punishment
he
got
from
the
east
india
company's
government
was
a
solemn
official
reprimand
suggest
the
suspicion
that
he
was
a
european
of
consequence
the
same
public
document
which
contained
the
reprimand
gave
warning
that
future
offenders
of
his
sort
if
in
the
company's
service
would
be
dismissed
and
if
merchants
suffer
revocation
of
license
and
exile
to
england
the
towers
are
not
tall
but
are
low
in
proportion
to
their
circumference
like
a
gasometer
if
you
should
fill
a
gasometer
half
way
up
with
solid
granite
masonry
then
drive
a
wide
and
deep
well
down
through
the
center
of
this
mass
of
masonry
you
would
have
the
idea
of
a
tower
of
silence
on
the
masonry
surrounding
the
well
the
bodies
lie
in
shallow
trenches
which
radiate
like
wheel
spokes
from
the
well
the
trenches
slant
toward
the
well
and
carry
into
it
the
rainfall
underground
drains
with
charcoal
filters
in
them
carry
off
this
water
from
the
bottom
of
the
well
when
a
skeleton
has
lain
in
the
tower
exposed
to
the
rain
and
the
flaming
sun
a
month
it
is
perfectly
dry
and
clean
then
the
same
bearers
that
brought
it
there
come
gloved
and
take
it
up
with
tongs
and
throw
it
into
the
well
there
it
turns
to
dust
it
is
never
seen
again
never
touched
again
in
the
world
other
peoples
separate
their
dead
and
preserve
and
continue
social
distinctions
in
the
grave
the
skeletons
of
kings
and
statesmen
and
generals
in
temples
and
pantheons
proper
to
skeletons
of
their
degree
and
the
skeletons
of
the
commonplace
and
the
poor
in
places
suited
to
their
meaner
estate
but
the
parsees
hold
that
all
men
rank
alike
in
death
all
are
humble
all
poor
all
destitute
in
sign
of
their
poverty
they
are
sent
to
their
grave
naked
in
sign
of
their
equality
the
bones
of
the
rich
the
poor
the
illustrious
and
the
obscure
are
flung
into
the
common
well
together
at
a
parsee
funeral
there
are
no
vehicles
all
concerned
must
walk
both
rich
and
poor
howsoever
great
the
distance
to
be
traversed
may
be
in
the
wells
of
the
five
towers
of
silence
is
mingled
the
dust
of
all
the
parsee
men
and
women
and
children
who
have
died
in
bombay
and
its
vicinity
during
the
two
centuries
which
have
elapsed
since
the
mohammedan
conquerors
drove
the
parsees
out
of
persia
and
into
that
region
of
india
the
earliest
of
the
five
towers
was
built
by
the
modi
family
something
more
than
200
years
ago
and
it
is
now
reserved
to
the
heirs
of
that
house
none
but
the
dead
of
that
blood
are
carried
thither
the
origin
of
at
least
one
of
the
details
of
a
parsee
funeral
is
not
now
known
the
presence
of
the
dog
before
a
corpse
is
borne
from
the
house
of
mourning
it
must
be
uncovered
and
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
a
dog
a
dog
must
also
be
led
in
the
rear
of
the
funeral
mr
nusserwanjee
byranijee
secretary
to
the
parsee
punchayet
said
that
these
formalities
had
once
had
a
meaning
and
a
reason
for
their
institution
but
that
they
were
survivals
whose
origin
none
could
now
account
for
custom
and
tradition
continue
them
in
force
antiquity
hallows
them
it
is
thought
that
in
ancient
times
in
persia
the
dog
was
a
sacred
animal
and
could
guide
souls
to
heaven
also
that
his
eye
had
the
power
of
purifying
objects
which
had
been
contaminated
by
the
touch
of
the
dead
and
that
hence
his
presence
with
the
funeral
cortege
provides
an
ever
applicable
remedy
in
case
of
need
the
parsees
claim
that
their
method
of
disposing
of
the
dead
is
an
effective
protection
of
the
living
that
it
disseminates
no
corruption
no
impurities
of
any
sort
no
disease
germs
that
no
wrap
no
garment
which
has
touched
the
dead
is
allowed
to
touch
the
living
afterward
that
from
the
towers
of
silence
nothing
proceeds
which
can
carry
harm
to
the
outside
world
these
are
just
claims
i
think
as
a
sanitary
measure
their
system
seems
to
be
about
the
equivalent
of
cremation
and
as
sure
we
are
drifting
slowly
but
hopefully
toward
cremation
in
these
days
it
could
not
be
expected
that
this
progress
should
be
swift
but
if
it
be
steady
and
continuous
even
if
slow
that
will
suffice
when
cremation
becomes
the
rule
we
shall
cease
to
shudder
at
it
we
should
shudder
at
burial
if
we
allowed
ourselves
to
think
what
goes
on
in
the
grave
the
dog
was
an
impressive
figure
to
me
representing
as
he
did
a
mystery
whose
key
is
lost
he
was
humble
and
apparently
depressed
and
he
let
his
head
droop
pensively
and
looked
as
if
he
might
be
trying
to
call
back
to
his
mind
what
it
was
that
he
had
used
to
symbolize
ages
ago
when
he
began
his
function
there
was
another
impressive
thing
close
at
hand
but
i
was
not
privileged
to
see
it
that
was
the
sacred
fire
a
fire
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
burning
without
interruption
for
more
than
two
centuries
and
so
living
by
the
same
heat
that
was
imparted
to
it
so
long
ago
the
parsees
are
a
remarkable
community
there
are
only
about
60
000
in
bombay
and
only
about
half
as
many
as
that
in
the
rest
of
india
but
they
make
up
in
importance
what
they
lack
in
numbers
they
are
highly
educated
energetic
enterprising
progressive
rich
and
the
jew
himself
is
not
more
lavish
or
catholic
in
his
charities
and
benevolences
the
parsees
build
and
endow
hospitals
for
both
men
and
animals
and
they
and
their
womenkind
keep
an
open
purse
for
all
great
and
good
objects
they
are
a
political
force
and
a
valued
support
to
the
government
they
have
a
pure
and
lofty
religion
and
they
preserve
it
in
its
integrity
and
order
their
lives
by
it
we
took
a
final
sweep
of
the
wonderful
view
of
plain
and
city
and
ocean
and
so
ended
our
visit
to
the
garden
and
the
towers
of
silence
and
the
last
thing
i
noticed
was
another
symbol
a
voluntary
symbol
this
one
it
was
a
vulture
standing
on
the
sawed
off
top
of
a
tall
and
slender
and
branchless
palm
in
an
open
space
in
the
ground
he
was
perfectly
motionless
and
looked
like
a
piece
of
sculpture
on
a
pillar
and
he
had
a
mortuary
look
too
which
was
in
keeping
with
the
place
chapter
xli
there
is
an
old
time
toast
which
is
golden
for
its
beauty
when
you
ascend
the
hill
of
prosperity
may
you
not
meet
a
friend
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
the
next
picture
that
drifts
across
the
field
of
my
memory
is
one
which
is
connected
with
religious
things
we
were
taken
by
friends
to
see
a
jain
temple
it
was
small
and
had
many
flags
or
streamers
flying
from
poles
standing
above
its
roof
and
its
little
battlements
supported
a
great
many
small
idols
or
images
upstairs
inside
a
solitary
jain
was
praying
or
reciting
aloud
in
the
middle
of
the
room
our
presence
did
not
interrupt
him
nor
even
incommode
him
or
modify
his
fervor
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
front
of
him
was
the
idol
a
small
figure
in
a
sitting
posture
it
had
the
pinkish
look
of
a
wax
doll
but
lacked
the
doll's
roundness
of
limb
and
approximation
to
correctness
of
form
and
justness
of
proportion
mr
gandhi
explained
every
thing
to
us
he
was
delegate
to
the
chicago
fair
congress
of
religions
it
was
lucidly
done
in
masterly
english
but
in
time
it
faded
from
me
and
now
i
have
nothing
left
of
that
episode
but
an
impression
a
dim
idea
of
a
religious
belief
clothed
in
subtle
intellectual
forms
lofty
and
clean
barren
of
fleshly
grossnesses
and
with
this
another
dim
impression
which
connects
that
intellectual
system
somehow
with
that
crude
image
that
inadequate
idol
how
i
do
not
know
properly
they
do
not
seem
to
belong
together
apparently
the
idol
symbolized
a
person
who
had
become
a
saint
or
a
god
through
accessions
of
steadily
augmenting
holiness
acquired
through
a
series
of
reincarnations
and
promotions
extending
over
many
ages
and
was
now
at
last
a
saint
and
qualified
to
vicariously
receive
worship
and
transmit
it
to
heaven's
chancellery
was
that
it
and
thence
we
went
to
mr
premchand
roychand's
bungalow
in
lovelane
byculla
where
an
indian
prince
was
to
receive
a
deputation
of
the
jain
community
who
desired
to
congratulate
him
upon
a
high
honor
lately
conferred
upon
him
by
his
sovereign
victoria
empress
of
india
she
had
made
him
a
knight
of
the
order
of
the
star
of
india
it
would
seem
that
even
the
grandest
indian
prince
is
glad
to
add
the
modest
title
sir
to
his
ancient
native
grandeurs
and
is
willing
to
do
valuable
service
to
win
it
he
will
remit
taxes
liberally
and
will
spend
money
freely
upon
the
betterment
of
the
condition
of
his
subjects
if
there
is
a
knighthood
to
be
gotten
by
it
and
he
will
also
do
good
work
and
a
deal
of
it
to
get
a
gun
added
to
the
salute
allowed
him
by
the
british
government
every
year
the
empress
distributes
knighthoods
and
adds
guns
for
public
services
done
by
native
princes
the
salute
of
a
small
prince
is
three
or
four
guns
princes
of
greater
consequence
have
salutes
that
run
higher
and
higher
gun
by
gun
oh
clear
away
up
to
eleven
possibly
more
but
i
did
not
hear
of
any
above
eleven
gun
princes
i
was
told
that
when
a
four
gun
prince
gets
a
gun
added
he
is
pretty
troublesome
for
a
while
till
the
novelty
wears
off
for
he
likes
the
music
and
keeps
hunting
up
pretexts
to
get
himself
saluted
it
may
be
that
supremely
grand
folk
like
the
nyzam
of
hyderabad
and
the
gaikwar
of
baroda
have
more
than
eleven
guns
but
i
don't
know
when
we
arrived
at
the
bungalow
the
large
hall
on
the
ground
floor
was
already
about
full
and
carriages
were
still
flowing
into
the
grounds
the
company
present
made
a
fine
show
an
exhibition
of
human
fireworks
so
to
speak
in
the
matters
of
costume
and
comminglings
of
brilliant
color
the
variety
of
form
noticeable
in
the
display
of
turbans
was
remarkable
we
were
told
that
the
explanation
of
this
was
that
this
jain
delegation
was
drawn
from
many
parts
of
india
and
that
each
man
wore
the
turban
that
was
in
vogue
in
his
own
region
this
diversity
of
turbans
made
a
beautiful
effect
i
could
have
wished
to
start
a
rival
exhibition
there
of
christian
hats
and
clothes
i
would
have
cleared
one
side
of
the
room
of
its
indian
splendors
and
repacked
the
space
with
christians
drawn
from
america
england
and
the
colonies
dressed
in
the
hats
and
habits
of
now
and
of
twenty
and
forty
and
fifty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
a
hideous
exhibition
a
thoroughly
devilish
spectacle
then
there
would
have
been
the
added
disadvantage
of
the
white
complexion
it
is
not
an
unbearably
unpleasant
complexion
when
it
keeps
to
itself
but
when
it
comes
into
competition
with
masses
of
brown
and
black
the
fact
is
betrayed
that
it
is
endurable
only
because
we
are
used
to
it
nearly
all
black
and
brown
skins
are
beautiful
but
a
beautiful
white
skin
is
rare
how
rare
one
may
learn
by
walking
down
a
street
in
paris
new
york
or
london
on
a
week
day
particularly
an
unfashionable
street
and
keeping
count
of
the
satisfactory
complexions
encountered
in
the
course
of
a
mile
where
dark
complexions
are
massed
they
make
the
whites
look
bleached
out
unwholesome
and
sometimes
frankly
ghastly
i
could
notice
this
as
a
boy
down
south
in
the
slavery
days
before
the
war
the
splendid
black
satin
skin
of
the
south
african
zulus
of
durban
seemed
to
me
to
come
very
close
to
perfection
i
can
see
those
zulus
yet
'ricksha
athletes
waiting
in
front
of
the
hotel
for
custom
handsome
and
intensely
black
creatures
moderately
clothed
in
loose
summer
stuffs
whose
snowy
whiteness
made
the
black
all
the
blacker
by
contrast
keeping
that
group
in
my
mind
i
can
compare
those
complexions
with
the
white
ones
which
are
streaming
past
this
london
window
now
a

we
miscall

some
of

other
signs
of
diseased
blood
some
show
scars
of
a
tint
out
of
a
harmony
with
the
surrounding
shades
of
color
the
white
man's
complexion
makes
no
concealments
it
can't
it
seemed
to
have
been
designed
as
a
catch
all
for
everything
that
can
damage
it
ladies
have
to
paint
it
and
powder
it
and
cosmetic
it
and
diet
it
with
arsenic
and
enamel
it
and
be
always
enticing
it
and
persuading
it
and
pestering
it
and
fussing
at
it
to
make
it
beautiful
and
they
do
not
succeed
but
these
efforts
show
what
they
think
of
the
natural
complexion
as
distributed
as
distributed
it
needs
these
helps
the
complexion
which
they
try
to
counterfeit
is
one

restricts
to

very

ninety
nine

a

the

can
keep
it
how
long
ten

perhaps
the
advantage
is
with
the
zulu
i
think
he
starts
with
a
beautiful
complexion
and
it
will
last
him
through
and
as
for
the
indian
brown
firm
smooth
blemishless
pleasant
and
restful
to
the
eye
afraid
of
no
color
harmonizing
with
all
colors
and
adding
a
grace
to
them
all
i
think
there
is
no
sort
of
chance
for
the
average
white
complexion
against
that
rich
and
perfect
tint
to
return
to
the
bungalow
the
most
gorgeous
costume
present
were
worn
by
some
children
they
seemed
to
blaze
so
bright
were
the
colors
and
so
brilliant
the
jewels
strum
over
the
rich
materials
these
children
were
professional
nautch
dancers
and
looked
like
girls
but
they
were
boys
they
got
up
by
ones
and
twos
and
fours
and
danced
and
sang
to
an
accompaniment
of
weird
music
their
posturings
and
gesturings
were
elaborate
and
graceful
but
their
voices
were
stringently
raspy
and
unpleasant
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
monotony
about
the
tune
by
and
by
there
was
a
burst
of
shouts
and
cheers
outside
and
the
prince
with
his
train
entered
in
fine
dramatic
style
he
was
a
stately
man
he
was
ideally
costumed
and
fairly
festooned
with
ropes
of
gems
some
of
the
ropes
were
of
pearls
some
were
of
uncut
great
emeralds
emeralds
renowned
in
bombay
for
their
quality
and
value
their
size
was
marvelous
and
enticing
to
the
eye
those
rocks
a
boy
a
princeling
was
with
the
prince
and
he
also
was
a
radiant
exhibition
the
ceremonies
were
not
tedious
the
prince
strode
to
his
throne
with
the
port
and
majesty
and
the
sternness
of
a
julius
caesar
coming
to
receive
and
receipt
for
a
back
country
kingdom
and
have
it
over
and
get
out
and
no
fooling
there
was
a
throne
for
the
young
prince
too
and
the
two
sat
there
side
by
side
with
their
officers
grouped
at
either
hand
and
most
accurately
and
creditably
reproducing
the
pictures
which
one
sees
in
the
books
pictures
which
people
in
the
prince's
line
of
business
have
been
furnishing
ever
since
solomon
received
the
queen
of
sheba
and
showed
her
his
things
the
chief
of
the
jain
delegation
read
his
paper
of
congratulations
then
pushed
it
into
a
beautifully
engraved
silver
cylinder
which
was
delivered
with
ceremony
into
the
prince's
hands
and
at
once
delivered
by
him
without
ceremony
into
the
hands
of
an
officer
i
will
copy
the
address
here
it
is
interesting
as
showing
what
an
indian
prince's
subject
may
have
opportunity
to
thank
him
for
in
these
days
of
modern
english
rule
as
contrasted
with
what
his
ancestor
would
have
given
them
opportunity
to
thank
him
for
a
century
and
a
half
ago
the
days
of
freedom
unhampered
by
english
interference
a
century
and
a
half
ago
an
address
of
thanks
could
have
been
put
into
small
space
it
would
have
thanked
the
prince
1
for
not
slaughtering
too
many
of
his
people
upon
mere
caprice
2
for
not
stripping
them
bare
by
sudden
and
arbitrary
tax
levies
and
bringing
famine
upon
them
3
for
not
upon
empty
pretext
destroying
the
rich
and
seizing
their
property
4
for
not
killing
blinding
imprisoning
or
banishing
the
relatives
of
the
royal
house
to
protect
the
throne
from
possible
plots
5
for
not
betraying
the
subject
secretly
for
a
bribe
into
the
hands
of
bands
of
professional
thugs
to
be
murdered
and
robbed
in
the
prince's
back
lot
those
were
rather
common
princely
industries
in
the
old
times
but
they
and
some
others
of
a
harsh
sort
ceased
long
ago
under
english
rule
better
industries
have
taken
their
place
as
this
address
from
the
jain
community
will
show
your
highness
we
the
undersigned
members
of
the
jain
community
of
bombay
have
the
pleasure
to
approach
your
highness
with
the
expression
of
our
heartfelt
congratulations
on
the
recent
conference
on
your
highness
of
the
knighthood
of
the
most
exalted
order
of
the
star
of
india
ten
years
ago
we
had
the
pleasure
and
privilege
of
welcoming
your
highness
to
this
city
under
circumstances
which
have
made
a
memorable
epoch
in
the
history
of
your
state
for
had
it
not
been
for
a
generous
and
reasonable
spirit
that
your
highness
displayed
in
the
negotiations
between
the
palitana
durbar
and
the
jain
community
the
conciliatory
spirit
that
animated
our
people
could
not
have
borne
fruit
that
was
the
first
step
in
your
highness's
administration
and
it
fitly
elicited
the
praise
of
the
jain
community
and
of
the
bombay
government
a
decade
of
your
highness's
administration
combined
with
the
abilities
training
and
acquirements
that
your
highness
brought
to
bear
upon
it
has
justly
earned
for
your
highness
the
unique
and
honourable
distinction
the
knighthood
of
the
most
exalted
order
of
the
star
of
india
which
we
understand
your
highness
is
the
first
to
enjoy
among
chiefs
of
your
highness's
rank
and
standing
and
we
assure
your
highness
that
for
this
mark
of
honour
that
has
been
conferred
on
you
by
her
most
gracious
majesty
the
queen
empress
we
feel
no
less
proud
than
your
highness
establishment
of
commercial
factories
schools
hospitals
etc
by
your
highness
in
your
state
has
marked
your
highness's
career
during
these
ten
years
and
we
trust
that
your
highness
will
be
spared
to
rule
over
your
people
with
wisdom
and
foresight
and
foster
the
many
reforms
that
your
highness
has
been
pleased
to
introduce
in
your
state
we
again
offer
your
highness
our
warmest
felicitations
for
the
honour
that
has
been
conferred
on
you
we
beg
to
remain
your
highness's
obedient
servants
factories
schools
hospitals
reforms
the
prince
propagates
that
kind
of
things
in
the
modern
times
and
gets
knighthood
and
guns
for
it
after
the
address
the
prince
responded
with
snap
and
brevity
spoke
a
moment
with
half
a
dozen
guests
in
english
and
with
an
official
or
two
in
a
native
tongue
then
the
garlands
were
distributed
as
usual
and
the
function
ended

pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
toward
midnight
that
night
there
was
another
function
this
was
a
hindoo
wedding
no
i
think
it
was
a
betrothal
ceremony
always
before
we
had
driven
through
streets
that
were
multitudinous
and
tumultuous
with
picturesque
native
life
but
now
there
was
nothing
of
that
we
seemed
to
move
through
a
city
of
the
dead
there
was
hardly
a
suggestion
of
life
in
those
still
and
vacant
streets
even
the
crows
were
silent
but
everywhere
on
the
ground
lay
sleeping
natives
hundreds
and
hundreds
they
lay
stretched
at
full
length
and
tightly
wrapped
in
blankets
beads
and
all
their
attitude
and
their
rigidity
counterfeited
death
the
plague
was
not
in
bombay
then
but
it
is
devastating
the
city
now
the
shops
are
deserted
now
half
of
the
people
have
fled
and
of
the
remainder
the
smitten
perish
by
shoals
every
day
no
doubt
the
city
looks
now
in
the
daytime
as
it
looked
then
at
night
when
we
had
pierced
deep
into
the
native
quarter
and
were
threading
its
narrow
dim
lanes
we
had
to
go
carefully
for
men
were
stretched
asleep
all
about
and
there
was
hardly
room
to
drive
between
them
and
every
now
and
then
a
swarm
of
rats
would
scamper
across
past
the
horses'
feet
in
the
vague
light
the
forbears
of
the
rats
that
are
carrying
the
plague
from
house
to
house
in
bombay
now
the
shops
were
but
sheds
little
booths
open
to
the
street
and
the
goods
had
been
removed
and
on
the
counters
families
were
sleeping
usually
with
an
oil
lamp
present
recurrent
dead
watches
it
looked
like
but
at
last
we
turned
a
corner
and
saw
a
great
glare
of
light
ahead
it
was
the
home
of
the
bride
wrapped
in
a
perfect
conflagration
of
illuminations
mainly
gas
work
designs
gotten
up
specially
for
the
occasion
within
was
abundance
of
brilliancy
flames
costumes
colors
decorations
mirrors
it
was
another
aladdin
show
the
bride
was
a
trim
and
comely
little
thing
of
twelve
years
dressed
as
we
would
dress
a
boy
though
more
expensively
than
we
should
do
it
of
course
she
moved
about
very
much
at
her
ease
and
stopped
and
talked
with
the
guests
and
allowed
her
wedding
jewelry
to
be
examined
it
was
very
fine
particularly
a
rope
of
great
diamonds
a
lovely
thing
to
look
at
and
handle
it
had
a
great
emerald
hanging
to
it
the
bridegroom
was
not
present
he
was
having
betrothal
festivities
of
his
own
at
his
father's
house
as
i
understood
it
he
and
the
bride
were
to
entertain
company
every
night
and
nearly
all
night
for
a
week
or
more
then
get
married
if
alive
both
of
the
children
were
a
little
elderly
as
brides
and
grooms
go
in
india
twelve
they
ought
to
have
been
married
a
year
or
two
sooner
still
to
a
stranger
twelve
seems
quite
young
enough
a
while
after
midnight
a
couple
of
celebrated
and
high
priced
nautch
girls
appeared
in
the
gorgeous
place
and
danced
and
sang
with
them
were
men
who
played
upon
strange
instruments
which
made
uncanny
noises
of
a
sort
to
make
one's
flesh
creep
one
of
these
instruments
was
a
pipe
and
to
its
music
the
girls
went
through
a
performance
which
represented
snake
charming
it
seemed
a
doubtful
sort
of
music
to
charm
anything
with
but
a
native
gentleman
assured
me
that
snakes
like
it
and
will
come
out
of
their
holes
and
listen
to
it
with
every
evidence
of
refreshment
and
gratitude
he
said
that
at
an
entertainment
in
his
grounds
once
the
pipe
brought
out
half
a
dozen
snakes
and
the
music
had
to
be
stopped
before
they
would
be
persuaded
to
go
nobody
wanted
their
company
for
they
were
bold
familiar
and
dangerous
but
no
one
would
kill
them
of
course
for
it
is
sinful
for
a
hindoo
to
kill
any
kind
of
a
creature
we
withdrew
from
the
festivities
at
two
in
the
morning
another
picture
then
but
it
has
lodged
itself
in
my
memory
rather
as
a
stage
scene
than
as
a
reality
it
is
of
a
porch
and
short
flight
of
steps
crowded
with
dark
faces
and
ghostly
white
draperies
flooded
with
the
strong
glare
from
the
dazzling
concentration
of
illuminations
and
midway
of
the
steps
one
conspicuous
figure
for
accent
a
turbaned
giant
with
a
name
according
to
his
size
rao
bahadur
baskirao
balinkanje
pitale
vakeel
to
his
highness
the
gaikwar
of
baroda
without
him
the
picture
would
not
have
been
complete
and
if
his
name
had
been
merely
smith
he
wouldn't
have
answered
close
at
hand
on
house
fronts
on
both
sides
of
the
narrow
street
were
illuminations
of
a
kind
commonly
employed
by
the
natives
scores
of
glass
tumblers
containing
tapers
fastened
a
few
in
inches
apart
all
over
great
latticed
frames
forming
starry
constellations
which
showed
out
vividly
against
their
black
back
grounds
as
we
drew
away
into
the
distance
down
the
dim
lanes
the
illuminations
gathered
together
into
a
single
mass
and
glowed
out
of
the
enveloping
darkness
like
a
sun
then
again
the
deep
silence
the
skurrying
rats
the
dim
forms
stretched
every
where
on
the
ground
and
on
either
hand
those
open
booths
counterfeiting
sepulchres
with
counterfeit
corpses
sleeping
motionless
in
the
flicker
of
the
counterfeit
death
lamps
and
now
a
year
later
when
i
read
the
cablegrams
i
seem
to
be
reading
of
what
i
myself
partly
saw
saw
before
it
happened
in
a
prophetic
dream
as
it
were
one
cablegram
says
business
in
the
native
town
is
about
suspended
except
the
wailing
and
the
tramp
of
the
funerals
there
is
but
little
life
or
movement
the
closed
shops
exceed
in
number
those
that
remain
open
another
says
that
325
000
of
the
people
have
fled
the
city
and
are
carrying
the
plague
to
the
country
three
days
later
comes
the
news
the
population
is
reduced
by
half
the
refugees
have
carried
the
disease
to
karachi
220
cases
214
deaths
a
day
or
two
later
52
fresh
cases
all
of
which
proved
fatal
the
plague
carries
with
it
a
terror
which
no
other
disease
can
excite
for
of
all
diseases
known
to
men
it
is
the
deadliest
by
far
the
deadliest
fifty
two
fresh
cases
all
fatal
it
is
the
black
death
alone
that
slays
like
that
we
can
all
imagine
after
a
fashion
the
desolation
of
a
plague
stricken
city
and
the
stupor
of
stillness
broken
at
intervals
by
distant
bursts
of
wailing
marking
the
passing
of
funerals
here
and
there
and
yonder
but
i
suppose
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
realize
to
ourselves
the
nightmare
of
dread
and
fear
that
possesses
the
living
who
are
present
in
such
a
place
and
cannot
get
away
that
half
million
fled
from
bombay
in
a
wild
panic
suggests
to
us
something
of
what
they
were
feeling
but
perhaps
not
even
they
could
realize
what
the
half
million
were
feeling
whom
they
left
stranded
behind
to
face
the
stalking
horror
without
chance
of
escape
kinglake
was
in
cairo
many
years
ago
during
an
epidemic
of
the
black
death
and
he
has
imagined
the
terrors
that
creep
into
a
man's
heart
at
such
a
time
and
follow
him
until
they
themselves
breed
the
fatal
sign
in
the
armpit
and
then
the
delirium
with
confused
images
and
home
dreams
and
reeling
billiard
tables
and
then
the
sudden
blank
of
death
to
the
contagionist
filled
as
he
is
with
the
dread
of
final
causes
having
no
faith
in
destiny
nor
in
the
fixed
will
of
god
and
with
none
of
the
devil
may
care
indifference
which
might
stand
him
instead
of
creeds
to
such
one
every
rag
that
shivers
in
the
breeze
of
a
plague
stricken
city
has
this
sort
of
sublimity
if
by
any
terrible
ordinance
he
be
forced
to
venture
forth
be
sees
death
dangling
from
every
sleeve
and
as
he
creeps
forward
he
poises
his
shuddering
limbs
between
the
imminent
jacket
that
is
stabbing
at
his
right
elbow
and
the
murderous
pelisse
that
threatens
to
mow
him
clean
down
as
it
sweeps
along
on
his
left
but
most
of
all
he
dreads
that
which
most
of
all
he
should
love
the
touch
of
a
woman's
dress
for
mothers
and
wives
hurrying
forth
on
kindly
errands
from
the
bedsides
of
the
dying
go
slouching
along
through
the
streets
more
willfully
and
less
courteously
than
the
men
for
a
while
it
may
be
that
the
caution
of
the
poor
levantine
may
enable
him
to
avoid
contact
but
sooner
or
later
perhaps
the
dreaded
chance
arrives
that
bundle
of
linen
with
the
dark
tearful
eyes
at
the
top
of
it
that
labors
along
with
the
voluptuous
clumsiness
of
grisi
she
has
touched
the
poor
levantine
with
the
hem
of
her
sleeve!
from
that
dread
moment
his
peace
is
gone
his
mind
for
ever
hanging
upon
the
fatal
touch
invites
the
blow
which
he
fears
he
watches
for
the
symptoms
of
plague
so
carefully
that
sooner
or
later
they
come
in
truth
the
parched
mouth
is
a
sign
his
mouth
is
parched
the
throbbing
brain
his
brain
does
throb
the
rapid
pulse
he
touches
his
own
wrist
for
he
dares
not
ask
counsel
of
any
man
lest
he
be
deserted
he
touches
his
wrist
and
feels
how
his
frighted
blood
goes
galloping
out
of
his
heart
there
is
nothing
but
the
fatal
swelling
that
is
wanting
to
make
his
sad
conviction
complete
immediately
he
has
an
odd
feel
under
the
arm
no
pain
but
a
little
straining
of
the
skin
he
would
to
god
it
were
his
fancy
that
were
strong
enough
to
give
him
that
sensation
this
is
the
worst
of
all
it
now
seems
to
him
that
he
could
be
happy
and
contented
with
his
parched
mouth
and
his
throbbing
brain
and
his
rapid
pulse
if
only
he
could
know
that
there
were
no
swelling
under
the
left
arm
but
dares
he
try
in
a
moment
of
calmness
and
deliberation
he
dares
not
but
when
for
a
while
he
has
writhed
under
the
torture
of
suspense
a
sudden
strength
of
will
drives
him
to
seek
and
know
his
fate
he
touches
the
gland
and
finds
the
skin
sane
and
sound
but
under
the
cuticle
there
lies
a
small
lump
like
a
pistol
bullet
that
moves
as
he
pushes
it
oh!
but
is
this
for
all
certainty
is
this
the
sentence
of
death
feel
the
gland
of
the
other
arm
there
is
not
the
same
lump
exactly
yet
something
a
little
like
it
have
not
some
people
glands
naturally
enlarged
would
to
heaven
he
were
one!
so
he
does
for
himself
the
work
of
the
plague
and
when
the
angel
of
death
thus
courted
does
indeed
and
in
truth
come
he
has
only
to
finish
that
which
has
been
so
well
begun
he
passes
his
fiery
hand
over
the
brain
of
the
victim
and
lets
him
rave
for
a
season
but
all
chance
wise
of
people
and
things
once
dear
or
of
people
and
things
indifferent
once
more
the
poor
fellow
is
back
at
his
home
in
fair
provence
and
sees
the
sundial
that
stood
in
his
childhood's
garden
sees
his
mother
and
the
long
since
forgotten
face
of
that
little
dear
sister
he
sees
her
he
says
on
a
sunday
morning
for
all
the
church
bells
are
ringing
he
looks
up
and
down
through
the
universe
and
owns
it
well
piled
with
bales
upon
bales
of
cotton
and
cotton
eternal
so
much
so
that
he
feels
he
knows
he
swears
he
could
make
that
winning
hazard
if
the
billiard
table
would
not
slant
upwards
and
if
the
cue
were
a
cue
worth
playing
with
but
it
is
not
it's
a
cue
that
won't
move
his
own
arm
won't
move
in
short
there's
the
devil
to
pay
in
the
brain
of
the
poor
levantine
and
perhaps
the
next
night
but
one
he
becomes
the
'life
and
the
soul'
of
some
squalling
jackal
family
who
fish
him
out
by
the
foot
from
his
shallow
and
sandy
grave
chapter
xliii
hunger
is
the
handmaid
of
genius
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
one
day
during
our
stay
in
bombay
there
was
a
criminal
trial
of
a
most
interesting
sort
a
terribly
realistic
chapter
out
of
the
arabian
nights
a
strange
mixture
of
simplicities
and
pieties
and
murderous
practicalities
which
brought
back
the
forgotten
days
of
thuggee
and
made
them
live
again
in
fact
even
made
them
believable
it
was
a
case
where
a
young
girl
had
been
assassinated
for
the
sake
of
her
trifling
ornaments
things
not
worth
a
laborer's
day's
wages
in
america
this
thing
could
have
been
done
in
many
other
countries
but
hardly
with
the
cold
business
like
depravity
absence
of
fear
absence
of
caution
destitution
of
the
sense
of
horror
repentance
remorse
exhibited
in
this
case
elsewhere
the
murderer
would
have
done
his
crime
secretly
by
night
and
without
witnesses
his
fears
would
have
allowed
him
no
peace
while
the
dead
body
was
in
his
neighborhood
he
would
not
have
rested
until
he
had
gotten
it
safe
out
of
the
way
and
hidden
as
effectually
as
he
could
hide
it
but
this
indian
murderer
does
his
deed
in
the
full
light
of
day
cares
nothing
for
the
society
of
witnesses
is
in
no
way
incommoded
by
the
presence
of
the
corpse
takes
his
own
time
about
disposing
of
it
and
the
whole
party
are
so
indifferent
so
phlegmatic
that
they
take
their
regular
sleep
as
if
nothing
was
happening
and
no
halters
hanging
over
them
and
these
five
bland
people
close
the
episode
with
a
religious
service
the
thing
reads
like
a
meadows
taylor
thug
tale
of
half
a
century
ago
as
may
be
seen
by
the
official
report
of
the

attended
the
mill
for
half
a
day
and
then
returned

at

in

afternoon
when
i
saw
five
persons
in
the
house
viz
the
first
accused
tookaram
who
is
my
paramour
my
mother
the
second
accused
baya

and
in
that
room
i
my
paramour

his
younger
brother
yesso
mahadhoo
live
since
his
arrival
in

from
his
native
country
yesso
came
and
lived
with
us
when
i
returned
from
the
mill
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
i
saw
the
two
guests
seated
on
a
cot
in
the
veranda
and
a
few
minutes
after
the
accused
gopal
came
and
took
his
seat
by
their
side
while
i
and
my
mother
were
seated
inside
the
room
tookaram
who
had
gone
out
to
fetch
some
'pan'
and
betelnuts
on
his
return
home
had
brought
the
two
guests
with
him
after
returning
home
he
gave
them
'pan
supari'
while
they
were
eating
it
my
mother
came
out
of
the
room
and
inquired
of
one
of
the
guests
ramji
what
had
happened
to
his
foot
when
he
replied
that
he
had
tried
many
remedies
but
they
had
done
him
no
good
my
mother
then
took
some
rice
in
her
hand
and
prophesied
that
the
disease
which
ramji
was
suffering
from
would
not
be
cured
until
he
returned
to
his
native
country
in
the
meantime
the
deceased
casi
came
from
the
direction
of
an
out
house
and
stood
in
front
on
the
threshold
of
our
room
with
a
'lota'
in
her
hand
tookaram
then
told
his
two
guests
to
leave
the
room
and
they
then
went
up
the
steps
towards
the
quarry
after
the
guests
had
gone
away
tookaram
seized
the
deceased
who
had
come
into
the
room
and
he
afterwards
put
a
waistband
around
her
and
tied
her
to
a
post
which
supports
a
loft
after
doing
this
he
pressed
the
girl's
throat
and
having
tied
her
mouth
with
the
'dhotur'
now
shown
in
court
fastened
it
to
the
post
having
killed
the
girl
tookaram

studs
a
nose

but
he
failed
in
his
attempt
while
he
was
doing
so
i
my
mother
and
gopal
were
present
after
removing
the
two
gold
ornaments
he
handed
them
over
to
gopal
who
was
at
the
time
standing
near
me
when
he
killed
cassi
tookaram
threatened
to
strangle
me
also
if
i
informed
any
one
of
this
gopal
and
myself
were
then
standing
at
the
door
of
our
room
and
we
both
were
threatened
by
tookaram
my
mother
baya
had
seized
the
legs
of
the
deceased
at
the
time
she
was
killed
and
whilst
she
was
being
tied
to
the
post
cassi
then
made
a
noise
tookaram
and
my
mother
took
part
in
killing
the
girl
after
the
murder
her
body
was
wrapped
up
in
a
mattress
and
kept
on
the
loft

in
the
possession
of
the
information

was
slapped
and
threatened
by
my
paramour
tookaram
and
that
was
the
only
reason
why
i
did
not

at
that
time
when
i
told
tookaram
that
i
would
give
information
of
the
occurrence

slapped
me
the

away
with
him
the
two
gold
ornaments
and
the
'lota'
yesso

a
brother
in
law
of
tookaram
came
to
the
house
and
asked
taokaram
why
he
was
washing
the
water
pipe
being
just
opposite
tookaram
replied
that
he
was
washing
his
dhotur
as
a
fowl

polluted
it
about
6
o'clock
of
the
evening
of
that
day
my
mother
gave
me
three
pice
and
asked
me
to

a
cocoanut
and
i
gave
the
money
to
yessoo
who
went
and
fetched
a
cocoanut
and
some
betel
leaves
when
yessoo
and
others
were
in
the
room
i
was
bathing
and
after
i
finished
my
bath
my
mother
took
the
cocoanut
and
the
betel
leaves
from
yessoo
and
we
five
went
to
the
sea
the
party
consisted
of
tookaram
my
mother
yessoo
tookaram's
younger
brother
and
myself
on
reaching
the
seashore
my
mother
made
the
offering
to
the
sea
and
prayed
to
be
pardoned
for
what
we
had
done
before
we
went
to
the
sea
some
one
came
to
inquire
after
the
girl
cassi
the
police
and
other
people
came
to
make
these
inquiries
both
before
and
after
we
left
the
house
for
the
seashore
the
police
questioned
my
mother
about
the
girl
and
she
replied
that
cassi
had
come
to
her
door
but
had
left
the
next
day
the
police
questioned
tookaram
and
he
too
gave
a
similar
reply
this
was
said
the
same
night
when
the
search
was
made
for
the
girl
after
the
offering
was
made
to
the
sea
we
partook
of
the
cocoanut
and
returned
home
when
my
mother
gave
me
some
food
but
tookaram
did
not
partake
of
any
food
that
night
after
dinner
i
and
my
mother
slept
inside
the
room
and
tookaram
slept
on
a
cot
near
his
brother
in
law
yessoo
mahadhoo
just
outside
the
door
that
was
not
the
usual
place
where
tookaram
slept
he
usually
slept
inside
the
room
the
body
of
the
deceased
remained
on
the
loft
when
i
went
to
sleep
the
room
in
which
we
slept
was
locked
and
i
heard
that
my
paramour
tookaram
was
restless
outside
about
3
o'clock
the
following
morning
tookaram
knocked
at
the
door
when
both
myself
and
my
mother
opened
it
he
then
told
me
to
go
to
the
steps
leading
to
the
quarry
and
see
if
any
one
was
about
those
steps
lead
to
a
stable
through
which
we
go
to
the
quarry
at
the
back
of
the
compound
when
i
got
to
the
steps
i
saw
no
one
there
tookaram
asked
me
if
any
one
was
there
and
i
replied
that
i
could
see
no
one
about
he
then
took
the
body
of
the
deceased
from
the
loft
and
having
wrapped
it
up
in
his
saree
asked
me
to
accompany
him
to
the
steps
of
the
quarry
and
i
did
so
the
'saree'
now
produced
here
was
the
same
besides
the
'saree'
there
was
also
a
'cholee'
on
the
body
he
then
carried
the
body
in
his
arms
and
went
up
the
steps
through
the
stable
and
then
to
the
right
hand
towards
a
sahib's
bungalow
where
tookaram
placed
the
body
near
a
wall
all
the
time
i
and
my
mother
were
with
him
when
the
body
was
taken
down
yessoo
was
lying
on
the
cot
after
depositing
the
body
under
the
wall
we
all
returned
home
and
soon
after
5
a
m
the
police
again
came
and
took
tookaram
away
about
an
hour
after
they
returned
and
took
me
and
my
mother
away
we
were
questioned
about
it
when
i
made
a
statement
two
hours
later
i
was
taken
to
the
room
and
i
pointed
out
this
waistband
the
'dhotur'
the
mattress
and
the
wooden
post
to
superintendent
nolan
and
inspectors
roberts
and
rashanali
in
the
presence
of
my
mother
and
tookaram
tookaram
killed
the
girl
cassi
for
her
ornaments
which
he
wanted
for
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
shortly
going
to
be
married
the
body
was
found
in
the
same
place
where
it
was
deposited
by
tookaram
the
criminal
side
of
the
native
has
always
been
picturesque
always
readable
the
thuggee
and
one
or
two
other
particularly
outrageous
features
of
it
have
been
suppressed
by
the
english
but
there
is
enough
of
it
left
to
keep
it
darkly
interesting
one
finds
evidence
of
these
survivals
in
the
newspapers
macaulay
has
a
light
throwing
passage
upon
this
matter
in
his
great
historical
sketch
of
warren
hastings
where
he
is
describing
some
effects
which
followed
the
temporary
paralysis
of
hastings'
powerful
government
brought
about
by
sir
philip
francis
and
his
party
the
natives
considered
hastings
as
a
fallen
man
and
they
acted
after
their
kind
some
of
our
readers
may
have
seen
in
india
a
cloud
of
crows
pecking
a
sick
vulture
to
death
no
bad
type
of
what
happens
in
that
country
as
often
as
fortune
deserts
one
who
has
been
great
and
dreaded
in
an
instant
all
the
sycophants
who
had
lately
been

him

him
hasten
to
purchase
the
favor
of
his
victorious
enemies

accusing
him
an
indian
government

only
to
let
it
be
understood
that
it
wishes
a
particular
man
to
be
ruined
and
in
twenty
four
hours
it
will
be
furnished
with
grave
charges
supported
by
depositions
so
full
and
circumstantial
that
any
person
unaccustomed
to
asiatic
mendacity
would
regard
them
as
decisive
it
is
well
if
the
signature
of
the
destined
victim
is
not
counterfeited
at
the
foot
of
some
illegal
compact
and
if
some
treasonable
paper
is
not
slipped
into
a
hiding
place
in
his
house
that
was
nearly
a
century
and
a
quarter
ago
an
article
in
one
of
the
chief
journals
of
india
the
pioneer
shows
that
in
some
respects
the
native
of
to
day
is
just
what
his
ancestor
was
then
here
are
niceties
of
so
subtle
and
delicate
a
sort
that
they
lift
their
breed
of
rascality
to
a
place
among
the
fine
arts
and
almost
entitle
it
to
respect
the
records
of
the
indian
courts
might
certainly
be
relied
upon
to
prove
that
swindlers
as
a
class
in
the
east
come
very
close
to
if
they
do
not
surpass
in
brilliancy
of
execution
and
originality
of
design
the
most
expert
of
their
fraternity
in
europe
and
america
india
in
especial
is
the
home
of
forgery
there
are
some
particular
districts
which
are
noted
as
marts
for
the
finest
specimens
of
the
forger's
handiwork
the
business
is
carried
on
by
firms
who
possess
stores
of
stamped

bearing

other

have
earned
notoriety
for
skilled

a
pre
eminence
that
excites
a
respectful
admiration
when
one
thinks
of
the
universal
prevalence
of
the
art
and
persons
desirous
of
succeeding
in
false
suits
are
ready
to
pay
handsomely
to
avail
themselves
of
the
services
of
these
local
experts
as
witnesses
various
instances
illustrative
of
the
methods
of
these
swindlers
are
given
they
exhibit
deep
cunning
and
total
depravity
on
the
part
of
the
swindler
and
his
pals
and
more
obtuseness
on
the
part
of
the
victim
than
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
country
where
suspicion
of
your
neighbor
must
surely
be
one
of
the
earliest
things
learned
the
favorite
subject
is
the
young
fool
who
has
just
come
into
a
fortune
and
is
trying
to
see
how
poor
a
use
he
can
put
it
to
i
will
quote
one
example
sometimes
another
form
of
confidence
trick
is
adopted
which
is
invariably
successful
the
particular
pigeon
is
spotted
and
his
acquaintance
having
been
made
he
is
encouraged
in
every
form
of
vice
when
the
friendship
is
thoroughly
established
the
swindler
remarks
to
the
young
man
that
he
has
a
brother
who
has
asked
him
to
lend
him
rs
10
000
the
swindler
says
he
has
the
money
and
would
lend
it
but
as
the
borrower
is
his
brother
he
cannot
charge
interest
so
he
proposes
that
he
should
hand
the
dupe
the
money
and
the
latter
should
lend
it
to
the
swindler's
brother
exacting
a
heavy
pre
payment
of
interest
which
it
is
pointed
out
they
may
equally
enjoy
in
dissipation
the
dupe
sees
no
objection
and
on
the
appointed
day
receives
rs
7
000
from
the
swindler
which
he
hands
over
to
the
confederate
the
latter
is
profuse
in
his
thanks
and
executes
a
promissory
note
for
rs
10
000
payable
to
bearer
the
swindler
allows
the
scheme
to
remain
quiescent
for
a
time
and
then
suggests
that
as
the
money
has
not
been
repaid
and
as
it
would
be
unpleasant
to
sue
his
brother
it
would
be
better
to
sell
the
note
in
the
bazaar
the
dupe
hands
the
note
over
for
the
money
he
advanced
was
not
his
and
on
being
informed
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
his
signature
on
the
back
so
as
to
render
the
security
negotiable
he
signs
without
any
hesitation
the
swindler
passes
it
on
to
confederates
and
the
latter
employ
a
respectable
firm
of
solicitors
to
ask
the
dupe
if
his
signature
is
genuine
he
admits
it
at
once
and
his
fate
is
sealed
a
suit
is
filed
by
a
confederate
against
the
dupe
two
accomplices
being
made
co
defendants
they
admit
their
signatures
as
indorsers
and
the
one
swears
he
bought
the
note
for
value
from
the
dupe
the
latter
has
no
defense
for
no
court
would
believe
the
apparently
idle
explanation
of
the
manner
in
which
he
came
to
endorse
the
note
there
is
only
one
india!
it
is
the
only
country
that
has
a
monopoly
of
grand
and
imposing
specialties
when
another
country
has
a
remarkable
thing
it
cannot
have
it
all
to
itself
some
other
country
has
a
duplicate
but
india
that
is
different
its
marvels
are
its
own
the
patents
cannot
be
infringed
imitations
are
not
possible
and
think
of
the
size
of
them
the
majesty
of
them
the
weird
and
outlandish
character
of
the
most
of
them!
there
is
the
plague
the
black
death
india
invented
it
india
is
the
cradle
of
that
mighty
birth
the
car
of
juggernaut
was
india's
invention
so
was
the
suttee
and
within
the
time
of
men
still
living
eight
hundred
widows
willingly
and
in
fact
rejoicingly
burned
themselves
to
death
on
the
bodies
of

eight

do
it
this

famines
are
inconsequential
incidents
in
india
they
are
devastating
cataclysms
in
one
case
they
annihilate
hundreds
in
the

india
had

000

india
is
the
only
millionaire
with
her
everything
is
on
a
giant
scale
even
her
poverty
no
other
country
can
show
anything
to
compare
with
it
and
she
has
been
used
to
wealth
on
so
vast
a
scale
that
she
has
to
shorten
to
single
words
the
expressions
describing
great
sums
she
describes
100
000
with
one
word
a
'lahk'
she
describes
ten
millions
with
one
word
a
'crore'
in
the
bowels
of
the
granite
mountains
she
has
patiently
carved
out
dozens
of
vast
temples
and
made
them
glorious
with
sculptured
colonnades
and
stately
groups
of
statuary
and
has
adorned
the
eternal
walls
with
noble
paintings
she
has
built
fortresses
of
such
magnitude
that
the
show
strongholds
of
the
rest
of
the
world
are
but
modest
little
things
by
comparison
palaces
that
are
wonders
for
rarity
of
materials
delicacy
and
beauty
of
workmanship
and
for
cost
and
one
tomb
which
men
go
around
the
globe
to
see
it
takes
eighty
nations
speaking
eighty
languages
to
people
her
and
they
number
three
hundred
millions
on
top
of
all
this
she
is
the
mother
and
home
of
that
wonder
of
wonders
caste
and
of
that
mystery
of
mysteries
the
satanic
brotherhood
of
the
thugs
india
had
the
start
of
the
whole
world
in
the
beginning
of
things
she
had
the
first
civilization
she
had
the
first
accumulation
of
material
wealth
she
was
populous
with
deep
thinkers
and
subtle
intellects
she
had
mines
and
woods
and
a
fruitful
soil
it
would
seem
as
if
she
should
have
kept
the
lead
and
should
be
to
day
not
the
meek
dependent
of
an
alien
master
but
mistress
of
the
world
and
delivering
law
and
command
to
every
tribe
and
nation
in
it
but
in
truth
there
was
never
any
possibility
of
such
supremacy
for
her
if
there
had
been
but
one
india
and
one
language
but
there
were
eighty
of
them!
where
there
are
eighty
nations
and
several
hundred
governments
fighting
and
quarreling
must
be
the
common
business
of
life
unity
of
purpose
and
policy
are
impossible
out
of
such
elements
supremacy
in
the
world
cannot
come
even
caste
itself
could
have
had
the
defeating
effect
of
a
multiplicity
of
tongues
no
doubt
for
it
separates
a
people
into
layers
and
layers
and
still
other
layers
that
have
no
community
of
feeling
with
each
other
and
in
such
a
condition
of
things
as
that
patriotism
can
have
no
healthy
growth
it
was
the
division
of
the
country
into
so
many
states
and
nations
that
made
thuggee
possible
and
prosperous
it
is
difficult
to
realize
the
situation
but
perhaps
one
may
approximate
it
by
imagining
the
states
of
our
union
peopled
by
separate
nations
speaking
separate
languages
with
guards
and
custom
houses
strung
along
all
frontiers
plenty
of
interruptions
for
travelers
and
traders
interpreters
able
to
handle
all
the
languages
very
rare
or
non
existent
and
a
few
wars
always
going
on
here
and
there
and
yonder
as
a
further
embarrassment
to
commerce
and
excursioning
it
would
make
intercommunication
in
a
measure
ungeneral
india
had
eighty
languages
and
more
custom
houses
than
cats
no
clever
man
with
the
instinct
of
a
highway
robber
could
fail
to
notice
what
a
chance
for
business
was
here
offered
india
was
full
of
clever
men
with
the
highwayman
instinct
and
so
quite
naturally
the
brotherhood
of
the
thugs
came
into
being
to
meet
the
long
felt
want
how
long
ago
that
was
nobody
knows
centuries
it
is
supposed
one
of
the
chiefest
wonders
connected
with
it
was
the
success
with
which
it
kept
its
secret
the
english
trader
did
business
in
india
two
hundred
years
and
more
before
he
ever
heard
of
it
and
yet
it
was
assassinating
its
thousands
all
around
him

year

i
learned
of
an
official
thug
book
the
other
day
i
was
not
aware
before
that
there
was
such
a
thing
i
am
allowed
the
temporary
use
of
it
we
are
making
preparations
for
travel
mainly
the
preparations
are
purchases
of
bedding
this
is
to
be
used
in
sleeping
berths
in
the
trains
in
private
houses
sometimes
and
in
nine
tenths
of
the
hotels
it
is
not
realizable
and
yet
it
is
true
it
is
a
survival
an
apparently
unnecessary
thing
which
in
some
strange
way
has
outlived
the
conditions
which
once
made
it
necessary
it
comes
down
from
a
time
when
the
railway
and
the
hotel
did
not
exist
when
the
occasional
white
traveler
went
horseback
or
by
bullock
cart
and
stopped
over
night
in
the
small
dak
bungalow
provided
at
easy
distances
by
the
government
a
shelter
merely
and
nothing
more
he
had
to
carry
bedding
along
or
do
without
the
dwellings
of
the
english
residents
are
spacious
and
comfortable
and
commodiously
furnished
and
surely
it
must
be
an
odd
sight
to
see
half
a
dozen
guests
come
filing
into
such
a
place
and
dumping
blankets
and
pillows
here
and
there
and
everywhere
but
custom
makes
incongruous
things
congruous
one
buys
the
bedding
with
waterproof
hold
all
for
it
at
almost
any
shop
there
is
no
difficulty

what
a
spectacle
the
railway
station
was
at
train
time!
it
was
a
very
large
station
yet
when
we
arrived
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
world
was
present
half
of
it
inside
the
other
half
outside
and
both
halves
bearing
mountainous
head
loads
of
bedding
and
other
freight
trying
simultaneously
to
pass
each
other
in
opposing
floods
in
one
narrow
door
these
opposing
floods
were
patient
gentle
long
suffering
natives
with
whites
scattered
among
them
at
rare
intervals
and
wherever
a
white
man's
native
servant
appeared
that
native
seemed
to
have
put
aside
his
natural
gentleness
for
the
time
and
invested
himself
with
the
white
man's
privilege
of
making
a
way
for
himself
by
promptly
shoving
all
intervening
black
things
out
of
it
in
these
exhibitions
of
authority
satan
was
scandalous
he
was
probably
a
thug
in
one
of
his
former
incarnations
inside
the
great
station
tides
upon
tides
of
rainbow
costumed
natives
swept
along
this
way
and
that
in
massed
and
bewildering
confusion
eager
anxious
belated
distressed
and
washed
up
to
the
long
trains
and
flowed
into
them
with
their
packs
and
bundles
and
disappeared
followed
at
once
by
the
next
wash
the
next
wave
and
here
and
there
in
the
midst
of
this
hurly
burly
and
seemingly
undisturbed
by
it
sat
great
groups
of
natives
on
the
bare
stone
floor
young
slender
brown
women
old
gray
wrinkled
women
little
soft
brown
babies
old
men
young
men
boys
all
poor
people
but
all
the
females
among
them
both
big
and
little
bejeweled
with
cheap
and
showy
nose
rings
toe
rings
leglets
and
armlets
these
things
constituting
all
their
wealth
no
doubt
these
silent
crowds
sat
there
with
their
humble
bundles
and
baskets
and
small
household
gear
about
them
and
patiently
waited
for
what
a
train
that
was
to
start
at
some
time
or
other
during
the
day
or
night!
they
hadn't
timed
themselves
well
but
that
was
no
matter
the
thing
had
been
so
ordered
from
on
high
therefore
why
worry
there
was
plenty
of
time
hours
and
hours
of
it
and
the
thing
that
was
to
happen
would
happen
there
was
no
hurrying
it
the
natives
traveled
third
class
and
at
marvelously
cheap
rates
they
were
packed
and
crammed
into
cars
that
held
each
about
fifty
and
it
was
said
that
often
a
brahmin
of
the
highest
caste
was
thus
brought
into
personal
touch
and
consequent
defilement
with
persons
of
the
lowest
castes
no
doubt
a
very
shocking
thing
if
a
body
could
understand
it
and
properly
appreciate
it
yes
a
brahmin
who
didn't
own
a
rupee
and
couldn't
borrow
one
might
have
to
touch
elbows
with
a
rich
hereditary
lord
of
inferior
caste
inheritor
of
an
ancient
title
a
couple
of
yards
long
and
he
would
just
have
to
stand
it
for
if
either
of
the
two
was
allowed
to
go
in
the
cars
where
the
sacred
white
people
were
it
probably
wouldn't
be
the
august
poor
brahmin
there
was
an
immense
string
of
those
third
class
cars
for
the
natives
travel
by
hordes
and
a
weary
hard
night
of
it
the
occupants
would
have
no
doubt
when
we
reached
our
car
satan
and
barney
had
already
arrived
there
with
their
train
of
porters
carrying
bedding
and
parasols
and
cigar
boxes
and
were
at
work
we
named
him
barney
for
short
we
couldn't
use
his
real
name
there
wasn't
time
it
was
a
car
that
promised
comfort
indeed
luxury
yet
the
cost
of
it
well
economy
could
no
further
go
even
in
france
not
even
in
italy
it
was
built
of
the
plainest
and
cheapest
partially
smoothed
boards
with
a
coating
of
dull
paint
on
them
and
there
was
nowhere
a
thought
of
decoration
the
floor
was
bare
but
would
not
long
remain
so
when
the
dust
should
begin
to
fly
across
one
end
of
the
compartment
ran
a
netting
for
the
accommodation
of
hand
baggage
at
the
other
end
was
a
door
which
would
shut
upon
compulsion
but
wouldn't
stay
shut
it
opened
into
a
narrow
little
closet
which
had
a
wash
bowl
in
one
end
of
it
and
a
place
to
put
a
towel
in
case
you
had
one
with
you
and
you
would
be
sure
to
have
towels
because
you
buy
them
with
the
bedding
knowing
that
the
railway
doesn't
furnish
them
on
each
side
of
the
car
and
running
fore
and
aft
was
a
broad
leather
covered
sofa
to
sit
on
in
the
day
and
sleep
on
at
night
over
each
sofa
hung
by
straps
a
wide
flat
leather
covered
shelf
to
sleep
on
in
the
daytime
you
can
hitch
it
up
against
the
wall
out
of
the
way
and
then
you
have
a
big
unencumbered
and
most
comfortable
room
to
spread
out
in
no
car
in
any
country
is
quite
its
equal
for
comfort
and
privacy
i
think
for
usually
there
are
but
two
persons
in
it
and
even
when
there
are
four
there
is
but
little
sense
of
impaired
privacy
our
own
cars
at
home
can
surpass
the
railway
world
in
all
details
but
that
one
they
have
no
cosiness
there
are
too
many
people
together
at
the
foot
of
each
sofa
was
a
side
door
for
entrance
and
exit
along
the
whole
length
of
the
sofa
on
each
side
of
the
car
ran
a
row
of
large
single
plate
windows
of
a
blue
tint
blue
to
soften
the
bitter
glare
of
the
sun
and
protect
one's
eyes
from
torture
these
could
be
let
down
out
of
the
way
when
one
wanted
the
breeze
in
the
roof
were
two
oil
lamps
which
gave
a
light
strong
enough
to
read
by
each
had
a
green
cloth
attachment
by
which
it
could
be
covered
when
the
light
should
be
no
longer
needed
while
we
talked
outside
with
friends
barney
and
satan
placed
the
hand
baggage
books
fruits
and
soda
bottles
in
the
racks
and
the
hold
alls
and
heavy
baggage
in
the
closet
hung
the
overcoats
and
sun
helmets
and
towels
on
the
hooks
hoisted
the
two
bed
shelves
up
out
of
the
way
then
shouldered
their
bedding
and
retired
to
the
third
class
now
then
you
see
what
a
handsome
spacious
light
airy
homelike
place
it
was
wherein
to
walk
up
and
down
or
sit
and
write
or
stretch
out
and
read
and
smoke
a
central
door
in
the

compartment
it
was
occupied
by

nine

all
complete
there
are
no

apparently
it
was
an

was

heard
of

they
closed

tidied
up

put

it
was
novel
and
pleasant
and
i
stayed
awake
as
long
as
i
could
to
enjoy
it
and
to
read
about
those
strange
people
the
thugs
in
my
sleep
they
remained
with
me
and
tried
to
strangle
me
the
leader
of
the
gang
was
that
giant
hindoo
who
was
such
a
picture

strong

were

irrelevantly

quality
which
distinguishes
her
poetry
from

is
its
stern
and

barroda
arrived
at
7
this
morning
the
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
show
it
was
forlorn
to
have
to
turn
out
in
a
strange
place
at
such
a
time
and
the
blinking
lights
in
the
station
made
it
seem
night
still
but
the
gentlemen
who
had
come
to
receive
us
were
there
with
their
servants
and
they
make
quick
work
there
was
no
lost
time
we
were
soon
outside
and
moving
swiftly
through
the
soft
gray
light
and
presently
were
comfortably
housed
with
more
servants
to
help
than
we
were
used
to
and
with
rather
embarassingly
important
officials
to
direct
them
but
it
was
custom
they
spoke
ballarat
english
their
bearing
was
charming
and
hospitable
and
so
all
went
well
breakfast
was
a
satisfaction
across
the
lawns
was
visible
in
the
distance
through
the
open
window
an
indian
well
with
two
oxen
tramping
leisurely
up
and
down
long
inclines
drawing
water
and
out
of
the
stillness
came
the
suffering
screech
of
the
machinery
not
quite
musical
and
yet
soothingly
melancholy
and
dreamy
and
reposeful
a
wail
of
lost
spirits
one
might
imagine
and
commemorative
and
reminiscent
perhaps
for
of
course
the
thugs
used
to
throw
people
down
that
well
when
they
were
done
with
them
after
breakfast
the
day
began
a
sufficiently
busy
one
we
were
driven
by
winding
roads
through
a
vast
park
with
noble
forests
of
great
trees
and
with
tangles
and
jungles
of
lovely
growths
of
a
humbler
sort
and
at
one
place
three
large
gray
apes
came
out
and
pranced
across
the
road
a
good
deal
of
a
surprise
and
an
unpleasant
one
for
such
creatures
belong
in
the
menagerie
and
they
look
artificial
and
out
of
place
in
a
wilderness
we
came
to
the
city
by
and
by
and
drove
all
through
it
intensely
indian
it
was
and
crumbly
and
mouldering
and
immemorially
old
to
all
appearance
and
the
houses
oh
indescribably
quaint
and
curious
they
were
with
their
fronts
an
elaborate
lace
work
of
intricate
and
beautiful
wood
carving
and
now
and
then
further
adorned
with
rude
pictures
of
elephants
and
princes
and
gods
done
in
shouting
colors
and
all
the
ground
floors
along
these
cramped
and
narrow
lanes
occupied
as
shops
shops
unbelievably
small
and
impossibly
packed
with
merchantable
rubbish
and
with
nine
tenths
naked
natives
squatting
at
their
work
of
hammering
pounding
brazing
soldering
sewing
designing
cooking
measuring
out
grain
grinding
it
repairing
idols
and
then
the
swarm
of
ragged
and
noisy
humanity
under
the
horses'
feet
and
everywhere
and
the
pervading
reek
and
fume
and
smell!
it
was
all
wonderful
and
delightful
imagine
a
file
of
elephants
marching
through
such
a
crevice
of
a
street
and
scraping
the
paint
off
both
sides
of
it
with
their
hides
how
big
they
must
look
and
how
little
they
must
make
the
houses
look
and
when
the
elephants
are
in
their
glittering
court
costume
what
a
contrast
they
must
make
with
the
humble
and
sordid
surroundings
and
when
a
mad
elephant
goes
raging
through
belting
right
and
left
with
his
trunk
how
do
these
swarms
of
people
get
out
of
the
way
i
suppose
it
is
a
thing
which
happens
now
and
then
in
the
mad
season
for
elephants
have
a
mad
season
i
wonder
how
old
the
town
is
there
are
patches
of
building
massive
structures
monuments
apparently
that
are
so
battered
and
worn
and
seemingly
so
tired
and
so
burdened
with
the
weight
of
age
and
so
dulled
and
stupefied
with
trying
to
remember
things
they
forgot
before
history
began
that
they
give
one
the
feeling
that
they
must
have
been
a
part
of
original
creation
this
is
indeed
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
princedoms
of
india
and
has
always
been
celebrated
for
its
barbaric
pomps
and
splendors
and
for
the
wealth
of
its
princes

out
of
the
town
again
a
long
drive
through
open
country
by
winding
roads
among
secluded
villages
nestling
in
the
inviting
shade
of
tropic
vegetation
a
sabbath
stillness
everywhere
sometimes
a
pervading
sense
of
solitude
but
always
barefoot
natives
gliding
by
like
spirits
without
sound
of
footfall
and
others
in
the
distance
dissolving
away
and
vanishing
like
the
creatures
of
dreams
now
and
then
a
string
of
stately
camels
passed
by
always
interesting
things
to
look
at
and
they
were
velvet
shod
by
nature
and
made
no
noise
indeed
there
were
no
noises
of
any
sort
in
this
paradise
yes
once
there
was
one
for
a
moment
a
file
of
native
convicts
passed
along
in
charge
of
an
officer
and
we
caught
the
soft
clink
of
their
chains
in
a
retired
spot
resting
himself
under
a
tree
was
a
holy
person
a
naked
black
fakeer
thin
and
skinny
and
whitey
gray
all
over
with
ashes
by
and
by
to
the
elephant
stables
and
i
took
a
ride
but
it
was
by
request
i
did
not
ask
for
it
and
didn't
want
it
but
i
took
it
because
otherwise
they
would
have
thought
i
was
afraid
which
i
was
the
elephant
kneels
down
by
command
one
end
of
him
at
a
time
and
you
climb
the
ladder
and
get
into
the
howdah
and
then
he
gets
up
one
end
at
a
time
just
as
a
ship
gets
up
over
a
wave
and
after
that
as
he
strides
monstrously
about
his
motion
is
much
like
a
ship's
motion
the
mahout
bores
into
the
back
of
his
head
with
a
great
iron
prod
and
you
wonder
at
his
temerity
and
at
the
elephant's
patience
and
you
think
that
perhaps
the
patience
will
not
last
but
it
does
and
nothing
happens
the
mahout
talks
to
the
elephant
in
a
low
voice
all
the
time
and
the
elephant
seems
to
understand
it
all
and
to
be
pleased
with
it
and
he
obeys
every
order
in
the
most
contented
and
docile
way
among
these
twenty
five
elephants
were
two
which
were
larger
than
any
i
had
ever
seen
before
and
if
i
had
thought
i
could
learn
to
not
be
afraid
i
would
have
taken
one
of
them
while
the
police
were
not
looking
in
the
howdah
house
there
were
many
howdahs
that
were
made
of
silver
one
of
gold
and
one
of
old
ivory
and
equipped
with
cushions
and
canopies
of
rich
and
costly
stuffs
the
wardrobe
of
the
elephants
was
there
too
vast
velvet
covers
stiff
and
heavy
with
gold
embroidery
and
bells
of
silver
and
gold
and
ropes
of
these
metals
for
fastening
the
things
on
harness
so
to
speak
and
monster
hoops
of
massive
gold
for
the
elephant
to
wear
on
his
ankles
when
he
is
out
in
procession
on
business
of
state
but
we
did
not
see
the
treasury
of
crown
jewels
and
that
was
a
disappointment
for
in
mass
and
richness
it
ranks
only
second
in
india
by
mistake
we
were
taken
to
see
the
new
palace
instead
and
we
used
up
the
last
remnant
of
our
spare
time
there
it
was
a
pity
too
for
the
new
palace
is
mixed
modern
american
european
and
has
not
a
merit
except
costliness
it
is
wholly
foreign
to
india
and
impudent
and
out
of
place
the
architect
has
escaped
this
comes
of
overdoing
the
suppression
of
the
thugs
they
had
their
merits
the
old
palace
is
oriental
and
charming
and
in
consonance
with
the
country
the
old
palace
would
still
be
great
if
there
were
nothing
of
it
but
the
spacious
and
lofty
hall
where
the
durbars
are
held
it
is
not
a
good
place
to
lecture
in
on
account
of
the
echoes
but
it
is
a
good
place
to
hold
durbars
in
and
regulate
the
affairs
of
a
kingdom
and
that
is
what
it
is
for
if
i
had
it
i
would
have
a
durbar
every
day
instead
of
once
or
twice
a
year
the
prince
is
an
educated
gentleman
his
culture
is
european
he
has
been
in
europe
five
times
people
say
that
this
is
costly
amusement
for
him
since
in
crossing
the
sea
he
must
sometimes
be
obliged
to
drink
water
from
vessels
that
are
more
or
less
public
and
thus
damage
his
caste
to
get
it
purified
again
he
must
make
pilgrimage
to
some
renowned
hindoo
temples
and
contribute
a
fortune
or
two
to
them
his
people
are
like
the
other
hindoos
profoundly
religious
and
they
could
not
be
content
with
a
master
who
was
impure
we
failed
to
see
the
jewels
but
we
saw
the
gold
cannon
and
the
silver
one
they
seemed
to
be
six
pounders
they
were
not
designed
for
business
but
for
salutes
upon
rare
and
particularly
important
state
occasions
an
ancestor
of
the
present
gaikwar
had
the
silver
one
made
and
a
subsequent
ancestor
had
the
gold
one
made
in
order
to
outdo
him
this
sort
of
artillery
is
in
keeping
with
the
traditions
of
baroda
which
was
of
old
famous
for
style
and
show
it
used
to
entertain
visiting
rajahs
and
viceroys
with
tiger
fights
elephant
fights
illuminations
and
elephant
processions
of
the
most
glittering
and
gorgeous
character
it
makes
the
circus
a
pale
poor
thing
in
the
train
during
a
part
of
the
return
journey
from
baroda
we
had
the
company
of
a
gentleman
who
had
with
him
a
remarkable
looking
dog
i
had
not
seen
one
of
its
kind
before
as
far
as
i
could
remember
though
of
course
i
might
have
seen
one
and
not
noticed
it
for
i
am
not
acquainted
with
dogs
but
only
with
cats
this
dog's
coat
was
smooth
and
shiny
and
black
and
i
think
it
had
tan
trimmings
around
the
edges
of
the
dog
and
perhaps
underneath
it
was
a
long
low
dog
with
very
short
strange
legs
legs
that
curved
inboard
something
like
parentheses
wrong
way
indeed
it
was
made
on
the
plan
of
a
bench
for
length
and
lowness
it
seemed
to
be
satisfied
but
i
thought
the
plan
poor
and
structurally
weak
on
account
of
the
distance
between
the
forward
supports
and
those
abaft
with
age
the
dog's
back
was
likely
to
sag
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
have
been
a
stronger
and
more
practicable
dog
if
it
had
had
some
more
legs
it
had
not
begun
to
sag
yet
but
the
shape
of
the
legs
showed
that
the
undue
weight
imposed
upon
them
was
beginning
to
tell
it
had
a
long
nose
and
floppy
ears
that
hung
down
and
a
resigned
expression
of
countenance
i
did
not
like
to
ask
what
kind
of
a
dog
it
was
or
how
it
came
to
be
deformed
for
it
was
plain
that
the
gentleman
was
very
fond
of
it
and
naturally
he
could
be
sensitive
about
it
from
delicacy
i
thought
it
best
not
to
seem
to
notice
it
too
much
no
doubt
a
man
with
a
dog
like
that
feels
just
as
a
person
does
who
has
a
child
that
is
out
of
true
the
gentleman
was
not
merely
fond
of
the
dog
he
was
also
proud
of
it
just
the
same
again
as
a
mother
feels
about
her
child
when
it
is
an
idiot
i
could
see
that
he
was
proud
of
it
not
withstanding
it
was
such
a
long
dog
and
looked
so
resigned
and
pious
it
had
been
all
over
the
world
with
him
and
had
been
pilgriming
like
that
for
years
and
years
it
had
traveled
50
000
miles
by
sea
and
rail
and
had
ridden
in
front
of
him
on
his
horse
8
000
it
had
a
silver
medal
from
the
geographical
society
of
great
britain
for
its
travels
and
i
saw
it
it
had
won
prizes
in
dog
shows
both
in
india
and
in
england
i
saw
them
he
said
its
pedigree
was
on
record
in
the
kennel
club
and
that
it
was
a
well
known
dog
he
said
a
great
many
people
in
london
could
recognize
it
the
moment
they
saw
it
i
did
not
say
anything
but
i
did
not
think
it
anything
strange
i
should
know
that
dog
again
myself
yet
i
am
not
careful
about
noticing
dogs
he
said
that
when
he
walked
along
in
london
people
often
stopped
and
looked
at
the
dog
of
course
i
did
not
say
anything
for
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
his
feelings
but
i
could
have
explained
to
him
that
if
you
take
a
great
long
low
dog
like
that
and
waddle
it
along
the
street
anywhere
in
the
world
and
not
charge
anything
people
will
stop
and
look
he
was
gratified
because
the
dog
took
prizes
but
that
was
nothing
if
i
were
built
like
that
i
could
take
prizes
myself
i
wished
i
knew
what
kind
of
a
dog
it
was
and
what
it
was
for
but
i
could
not
very
well
ask
for
that
would
show
that
i
did
not
know
not
that
i
want
a
dog
like
that
but
only
to
know
the
secret
of
its
birth
i
think
he
was
going
to
hunt
elephants
with
it
because
i
know
from
remarks
dropped
by
him
that
he
has
hunted
large
game
in
india
and
africa
and
likes
it
but
i
think
that
if
he
tries
to
hunt
elephants
with
it
he
is
going
to
be
disappointed
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
suited
for
elephants
it
lacks
energy
it
lacks
force
of
character
it
lacks
bitterness
these
things
all
show
in
the
meekness
and
resignation
of
its
expression
it
would
not
attack
an
elephant
i
am
sure
of
it
it
might
not
run
if
it
saw
one
coming
but
it
looked
to
me
like
a
dog
that
would
sit
down
and
pray
i
wish
he
had
told
me
what
breed
it
was
if
there
are
others
but
i
shall
know
the
dog
next
time
and
then
if
i
can
bring
myself
to
it
i
will
put
delicacy
aside
and
ask
if
i
seem
strangely
interested
in
dogs
i
have
a
reason
for
it
for
a
dog
saved
me
from
an
embarrassing
position
once
and
that
has
made
me
grateful
to
these
animals
and
if
by
study
i
could
learn
to
tell
some
of
the
kinds
from
the
others
i
should
be
greatly
pleased
i
only
know
one
kind
apart
yet
and
that
is
the
kind
that
saved
me
that
time
i
always
know
that
kind
when
i
meet
it
and
if
it
is
hungry
or
lost
i
take
care
of
it
the
matter
happened
in
this
way
it
was
years
and
years
ago
i
had
received
a
note
from
mr
augustin
daly
of
the
fifth
avenue
theatre
asking
me
to
call
the
next
time
i
should
be
in
new
york
i
was
writing
plays
in
those
days
and
he
was
admiring
them
and
trying
to
get
me
a
chance
to
get
them
played
in
siberia
i
took
the
first
train
the
early
one
the
one
that
leaves
hartford
at
8
29
in
the
morning
at
new
haven
i
bought
a
paper
and
found
it
filled
with
glaring
display
lines
about
a
bench
show
there
i
had
often
heard
of
bench
shows
but
had
never
felt
any
interest
in
them
because
i
supposed
they
were
lectures
that
were
not
well
attended
it
turned
out
now
that
it
was
not
that
but
a
dog
show
there
was
a
double
leaded
column
about
the
king
feature
of
this
one
which
was
called
a
saint
bernard
and
was
worth
$10
000
and
was
known
to
be
the
largest
and
finest
of
his
species
in
the
world
i
read
all
this
with
interest
because
out
of
my
school
boy
readings
i
dimly
remembered
how
the
priests
and
pilgrims
of
st
bernard
used
to
go
out
in
the
storms
and
dig
these
dogs
out
of
the
snowdrifts
when
lost
and
exhausted
and
give
them
brandy
and
save
their
lives
and
drag
them
to
the
monastery
and
restore
them
with
gruel
also
there
was
a
picture
of
this
prize
dog
in
the
paper
a
noble
great
creature
with
a
benignant
countenance
standing
by
a
table
he
was
placed
in
that
way
so
that
one
could
get
a
right
idea
of
his
great
dimensions
you
could
see
that
he
was
just
a
shade
higher
than
the
table
indeed
a
huge
fellow
for
a
dog
then
there
was
a
description
which
event
into
the
details
it
gave
his
enormous
weight
150
1/2
pounds
and
his
length
4
feet
2
inches
from
stem
to
stern
post
and
his
height
3
feet
1
inch
to
the
top
of
his
back
the
pictures
and
the
figures
so
impressed
me
that
i
could
see
the
beautiful
colossus
before
me
and
i
kept
on
thinking
about
him
for
the
next
two
hours
then
i
reached
new
york
and
he
dropped
out
of
my
mind
in
the
swirl
and
tumult
of
the
hotel
lobby
i
ran
across
mr
daly's
comedian
the
late
james
lewis
of
beloved
memory
and
i
casually
mentioned
that
i
was
going
to
call
upon
mr
daly
in
the
evening
at
8
he
looked
surprised
and
said
he
reckoned
not
for
answer
i
handed
him
mr
daly's
note
its
substance
was
come
to
my
private
den
over
the
theater
where
we
cannot
be
interrupted
and
come
by
the
back
way
not
the
front
no
642
sixth
avenue
is
a
cigar
shop
pass
through
it
and
you
are
in
a
paved
court
with
high
buildings
all
around
enter
the
second
door
on
the
left
and
come
up
stairs
is
this
all
yes
i
said
well
you'll
never
get
in
why
because
you
won't
or
if
you
do
you
can
draw
on
me
for
a
hundred
dollars
for
you
will
be
the
first
man
that
has
accomplished
it
in
twenty
five
years
i
can't
think
what
mr
daly
can
have
been
absorbed
in
he
has
forgotten
a
most
important
detail
and
he
will
feel
humiliated
in
the
morning
when
he
finds
that
you
tried
to
get
in
and
couldn't
why
what
is
the
trouble
i'll
tell
you
you
see
at
that
point
we
were
swept
apart
by
the
crowd
somebody
detained
me
with
a
moment's
talk
and
we
did
not
get
together
again
but
it
did
not
matter
i
believed
he
was
joking
anyway
at
eight
in
the
evening
i
passed
through
the
cigar
shop
and
into
the
court
and
knocked
at
the
second
door
come
in!
i
entered
it
was
a
small
room
carpetless
dusty
with
a
naked
deal
table
and
two
cheap
wooden
chairs
for
furniture
a
giant
irishman
was
standing
there
with
shirt
collar
and
vest
unbuttoned
and
no
coat
on
i
put
my
hat
on
the
table
and
was
about
to
say
something
when
the
irishman
took
the
innings
himself
and
not
with
marked
courtesy
of
tone
well
sor
what
will
you
have
i
was
a
little
disconcerted
and
my
easy
confidence
suffered
a
shrinkage
the
man
stood
as
motionless
as
gibraltar
and
kept
his
unblinking
eye
upon
me
it
was
very
embarrassing
very
humiliating
i
stammered
at
a
false
start
or
two
then
i
have
just
run
down
from
av
ye
plaze
ye'll
not
smoke
here
ye
understand
i
laid
my
cigar
on
the
window
ledge
chased
my
flighty
thoughts
a
moment
then
said
in
a
placating
manner
i
i
have
come
to
see
mr
daly
oh
ye
have
have
ye
yes
well
ye'll
not
see
him
but
he
asked
me
to
come
oh
he
did
did
he
yes
he
sent
me
this
note
and
lemme
see
it
for
a
moment
i
fancied
there
would
be
a
change
in
the
atmosphere
now
but
this
idea
was
premature
the
big
man
was
examining
the
note
searchingly
under
the
gas
jet
a
glance
showed
me
that
he
had
it
upside
down
disheartening
evidence
that
he
could
not
read
is
ut
his
own
handwrite
yes
he
wrote
it
himself
he
did
did
he
yes
h'm
well
then
why
ud
he
write
it
like
that
how
do
you
mean
i
mane
why
wudn't
he
put
his
naime
to
ut
his
name
is
to
it
that's
not
it
you
are
looking
at
my
name
i
thought
that
that
was
a
home
shot
but
he
did
not
betray
that
he
had
been
hit
he
said
it's
not
an
aisy
one
to
spell
how
do
you
pronounce
ut
mark
twain
h'm
h'm
mike
train
h'm
i
don't
remember
ut
what
is
it
ye
want
to
see
him
about
it
isn't
i
that
want
to
see
him
he
wants
to
see
me
oh
he
does
does
he
yes
what
does
he
want
to
see
ye
about
i
don't
know
ye
don't
know!
and
ye
confess
it
becod!
well
i
can
tell
ye
wan
thing
ye'll
not
see
him
are
ye
in
the
business
what
business
the
show
business
a
fatal
question
i
recognized
that
i
was
defeated
if
i
answered
no
he
would
cut
the
matter
short
and
wave
me
to
the
door
without
the
grace
of
a
word
i
saw
it
in
his
uncompromising
eye
if
i
said
i
was
a
lecturer
he
would
despise
me
and
dismiss
me
with
opprobrious
words
if
i
said
i
was
a
dramatist
he
would
throw
me
out
of
the
window
i
saw
that
my
case
was
hopeless
so
i
chose
the
course
which
seemed
least
humiliating
i
would
pocket
my
shame
and
glide
out
without
answering
the
silence
was
growing
lengthy
i'll
ask
ye
again
are
ye
in
the
show
business
yerself
yes!
i
said
it
with
splendid
confidence
for
in
that
moment
the
very
twin
of
that
grand
new
haven
dog
loafed
into
the
room
and
i
saw
that
irishman's
eye
light
eloquently
with
pride
and
affection
ye
are
and
what
is
it
i've
got
a
bench
show
in
new
haven
the
weather
did
change
then
you
don't
say
sir!
and
that's
your
show
sir!
oh
it's
a
grand
show
it's
a
wonderful
show
sir
and
a
proud
man
i
am
to
see
your
honor
this
day
and
ye'll
be
an
expert
sir
and
ye'll
know
all
about
dogs
more
than
ever
they
know
theirselves
i'll
take
me
oath
to
ut
i
said
with
modesty
i
believe
i
have
some
reputation
that
way
in
fact
my
business
requires
it
ye
have
some
reputation
your
honor!
bedad
i
believe
you!
there's
not
a
jintleman
in
the
worrld
that
can
lay
over
ye
in
the
judgmint
of
a
dog
sir
now
i'll
vinture
that
your
honor'll
know
that
dog's
dimensions
there
better
than
he
knows
them
his
own
self
and
just
by
the
casting
of
your
educated
eye
upon
him
would
you
mind
giving
a
guess
if
ye'll
be
so
good
i
knew
that
upon
my
answer
would
depend
my
fate
if
i
made
this
dog
bigger
than
the
prize
dog
it
would
be
bad
diplomacy
and
suspicious
if
i
fell
too
far
short
of
the
prizedog
that
would
be
equally
damaging
the
dog
was
standing
by
the
table
and
i
believed
i
knew
the
difference
between
him
and
the
one
whose
picture
i
had
seen
in
the
newspaper
to
a
shade
i
spoke
promptly
up
and
said
it's
no
trouble
to
guess
this
noble
creature's
figures
height
three
feet
length
four
feet
and
three
quarters
of
an
inch
weight
a
hundred
and
forty
eight
and
a
quarter
the
man
snatched
his
hat
from
its
peg
and
danced
on
it
with
joy
shouting
ye've
hardly
missed
it
the
hair's
breadth
hardly
the
shade
of
a
shade
your
honor!
oh
it's
the
miraculous
eye
ye've
got
for
the
judgmint
of
a
dog!
and
still
pouring
out
his
admiration
of
my
capacities
he
snatched
off
his
vest
and
scoured
off
one
of
the
wooden
chairs
with
it
and
scrubbed
it
and
polished
it
and
said
there
sit
down
your
honor
i'm
ashamed
of
meself
that
i
forgot
ye
were
standing
all
this
time
and
do
put
on
your
hat
ye
mustn't
take
cold
it's
a
drafty
place
and
here
is
your
cigar
sir
a
getting
cold
i'll
give
ye
a
light
there
the
place
is
all
yours
sir
and
if
ye'll
just
put
your
feet
on
the
table
and
make
yourself
at
home
i'll
stir
around
and
get
a
candle
and
light
ye
up
the
ould
crazy
stairs
and
see
that
ye
don't
come
to
anny
harm
for
be
this
time
mr
daly'll
be
that
impatient
to
see
your
honor
that
he'll
be
taking
the
roof
off
he
conducted
me
cautiously
and
tenderly
up
the
stairs
lighting
the
way
and
protecting
me
with
friendly
warnings
then
pushed
the
door
open
and
bowed
me
in
and
went
his
way
mumbling
hearty
things
about
my
wonderful
eye
for
points
of
a
dog
mr
daly
was
writing
and
had
his
back
to
me
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
presently
then
jumped
up
and
said
oh
dear
me
i
forgot
all
about
giving
instructions
i
was
just
writing
you
to
beg
a
thousand
pardons
but
how
is
it
you
are
here
how
did
you
get
by
that
irishman
you
are
the
first
man
that's
done
it
in
five
and
twenty
years
you
didn't
bribe
him
i
know
that
there's
not
money
enough
in
new
york
to
do
it
and
you
didn't
persuade
him
he
is
all
ice
and
iron
there
isn't
a
soft
place
nor
a
warm
one
in
him
anywhere
that
is
your
secret
look
here
you
owe
me
a
hundred
dollars
for
unintentionally
giving
you
a
chance
to
perform
a
miracle
for
it
is
a
miracle
that
you've
done
that
is
all
right
i
said
collect
it
of
jimmy
lewis
that
good
dog
not
only
did
me
that
good
turn
in
the
time
of
my
need
but
he
won
for
me
the
envious
reputation
among
all
the
theatrical
people
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
of
being
the
only
man
in
history
who
had
ever
run
the
blockade
of
augustin
daly's
back
door
chapter
xlvi
if
the
desire
to
kill
and
the
opportunity
to
kill
came
always
together
who
would
escape
hanging
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
on
the
train
fifty
years
ago
when
i
was
a
boy
in
the
then
remote
and
sparsely
peopled
mississippi
valley
vague
tales
and
rumors
of
a
mysterious
body
of
professional
murderers
came
wandering
in
from
a
country
which
was
constructively
as
far
from
us
as
the
constellations
blinking
in
space
india
vague
tales
and
rumors
of
a
sect
called
thugs
who
waylaid
travelers
in
lonely
places
and
killed
them
for
the
contentment
of
a
god
whom
they
worshiped
tales
which
everybody
liked
to
listen
to
and
nobody
believed
except
with
reservations
it
was
considered
that
the
stories
had
gathered
bulk
on
their
travels
the
matter
died
down
and
a
lull
followed
then
eugene
sue's
wandering
jew
appeared
and
made
great
talk
for
a
while
one
character
in
it
was
a
chief
of
thugs
feringhea
a
mysterious
and
terrible
indian
who
was
as
slippery
and
sly
as
a
serpent
and
as
deadly
and
he
stirred
up
the
thug
interest
once
more
but
it
did
not
last
it
presently
died
again
this
time
to
stay
dead
at
first
glance
it
seems
strange
that
this
should
have
happened
but
really
it
was
not
strange
on
the
contrary
it
was
natural
i
mean
on
our
side
of
the
water
for
the
source
whence
the
thug
tales
mainly
came
was
a
government
report
and
without
doubt
was
not
republished
in
america
it
was
probably
never
even
seen
there
government
reports
have
no
general
circulation
they
are
distributed
to
the
few
and
are
not
always
read
by
those
few
i
heard
of
this
report
for
the
first
time
a
day
or
two
ago
and
borrowed
it
it
is
full
of
fascinations
and
it
turns
those
dim
dark
fairy
tales
of
my
boyhood
days
into
realities
the
report
was
made
in
1889
by
major
sleeman
of
the
indian
service
and
was
printed
in
calcutta
in
1840
it
is
a
clumsy
great
fat
poor
sample
of
the
printer's
art
but
good
enough
for
a
government
printing
office
in
that
old
day
and
in
that
remote
region
perhaps
to
major
sleeman
was
given
the
general
superintendence
of
the
giant
task
of
ridding
india
of
thuggee
and
he
and
his
seventeen
assistants
accomplished
it
it
was
the
augean
stables
over
again
captain
vallancey
writing
in
a
madras
journal
in
those
old
times
makes
this
remark
the
day
that
sees
this
far
spread
evil
eradicated
from
india
and
known
only
in
name
will
greatly
tend
to
immortalize
british
rule
in
the
east
he
did
not
overestimate
the
magnitude
and
difficulty
of
the
work
nor
the
immensity
of
the
credit
which
would
justly
be
due
to
british
rule
in
case
it
was
accomplished
thuggee
became
known
to
the
british
authorities
in
india
about
1810
but
its
wide
prevalence
was
not
suspected
it
was
not
regarded
as
a
serious
matter
and
no
systematic
measures
were
taken
for
its
suppression
until
about
1830
about
that
time
major
sleeman
captured
eugene
sue's
thug
chief
feringhea
and
got
him
to
turn
king's
evidence
the
revelations
were
so
stupefying
that
sleeman
was
not
able
to
believe
them
sleeman
thought
he
knew
every
criminal
within
his
jurisdiction
and
that
the
worst
of
them
were
merely
thieves
but
feringhea
told
him
that
he
was
in
reality
living
in
the
midst
of
a
swarm
of
professional
murderers
that
they
had
been
all
about
him
for
many
years
and
that
they
buried
their
dead
close
by
these
seemed
insane
tales
but
feringhea
said
come
and
see
and
he
took
him
to
a
grave
and
dug
up
a
hundred
bodies
and
told
him
all
the
circumstances
of
the
killings
and
named
the
thugs
who
had
done
the
work
it
was
a
staggering
business
sleeman
captured
some
of
these
thugs
and
proceeded
to
examine
them
separately
and
with
proper
precautions
against
collusion
for
he
would
not
believe
any
indian's
unsupported
word
the
evidence
gathered
proved
the
truth
of
what
feringhea
had
said
and
also
revealed
the
fact
that
gangs
of
thugs
were
plying
their
trade
all
over
india
the
astonished
government
now
took
hold
of
thuggee
and
for
ten
years
made
systematic
and
relentless
war
upon
it
and
finally
destroyed
it
gang
after
gang
was
captured
tried
and
punished
the
thugs
were
harried
and
hunted
from
one
end
of
india
to
the
other
the
government
got
all
their
secrets
out
of
them
and
also
got
the
names
of
the
members
of
the
bands
and
recorded
them
in
a
book
together
with
their
birthplaces
and
places
of
residence
the
thugs
were
worshipers
of
bhowanee
and
to
this
god
they
sacrificed
anybody
that
came
handy
but
they
kept
the
dead
man's
things
themselves
for
the
god
cared
for
nothing
but
the
corpse
men
were
initiated
into
the
sect
with
solemn
ceremonies
then
they
were
taught
how
to
strangle
a
person
with
the
sacred
choke
cloth
but
were
not
allowed
to
perform
officially
with
it
until
after
long
practice
no
half
educated
strangler
could
choke
a
man
to
death
quickly
enough
to
keep
him
from
uttering
a
sound
a
muffled
scream
gurgle
gasp
moan
or
something
of
the
sort
but
the
expert's
work
was
instantaneous
the
cloth
was
whipped
around
the
victim's
neck
there
was
a
sudden
twist
and
the
head
fell
silently
forward
the
eyes
starting
from
the
sockets
and
all
was
over
the
thug
carefully
guarded
against
resistance
it
was
usual
to
to
get
the
victims
to
sit
down
for
that
was
the
handiest
position
for
business
if
the
thug
had
planned
india
itself
it
could
not
have
been
more
conveniently
arranged
for
the
needs
of
his
occupation
there
were
no
public
conveyances
there
were
no
conveyances
for
hire
the
traveler
went
on
foot
or
in
a
bullock
cart
or
on
a
horse
which
he
bought
for
the
purpose
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
his
own
little
state
or
principality
he
was
among
strangers
nobody
knew
him
nobody
took
note
of
him
and
from
that
time
his
movements
could
no
longer
be
traced
he
did
not
stop
in
towns
or
villages
but
camped
outside
of
them
and
sent
his
servants
in
to
buy
provisions
there
were
no
habitations
between
villages
whenever
he
was
between
villages
he
was
an
easy
prey
particularly
as
he
usually
traveled
by
night
to
avoid
the
heat
he
was
always
being
overtaken
by
strangers
who
offered
him
the
protection
of
their
company
or
asked
for
the
protection
of
his
and
these
strangers
were
often
thugs
as
he
presently
found
out
to
his
cost
the
landholders
the
native
police
the
petty
princes
the
village
officials
the
customs
officers
were
in
many
cases
protectors
and
harborers
of
the
thugs
and
betrayed
travelers
to
them
for
a
share
of
the
spoil
at
first
this
condition
of
things
made
it
next
to
impossible
for
the
government
to
catch
the
marauders
they
were
spirited
away
by
these
watchful
friends
all
through
a
vast
continent
thus
infested
helpless
people
of
every
caste
and
kind
moved
along
the
paths
and
trails
in
couples
and
groups
silently
by
night
carrying
the
commerce
of
the
country
treasure
jewels
money
and
petty
batches
of
silks
spices
and
all
manner
of
wares
it
was
a
paradise
for
the
thug
when
the
autumn
opened
the
thugs
began
to
gather
together
by
pre
concert
other
people
had
to
have
interpreters
at
every
turn
but
not
the
thugs
they
could
talk
together
no
matter
how
far
apart
they
were
born
for
they
had
a
language
of
their
own
and
they
had
secret
signs
by
which
they
knew
each
other
for
thugs
and
they
were
always
friends
even
their
diversities
of
religion
and
caste
were
sunk
in
devotion
to
their
calling
and
the
moslem
and
the
high
caste
and
low
caste
hindoo
were
staunch
and
affectionate
brothers
in
thuggery
when
a
gang
had
been
assembled
they
had
religious
worship
and
waited
for
an
omen
they
had
definite
notions
about
the
omens
the
cries
of
certain
animals
were
good
omens
the
cries
of
certain
other
creatures
were
bad
omens
a
bad
omen
would
stop
proceedings
and
send
the
men
home
the
sword
and
the
strangling
cloth
were
sacred
emblems
the
thugs
worshiped
the
sword
at
home
before
going
out
to
the
assembling
place
the
strangling
cloth
was
worshiped
at
the
place
of
assembly
the
chiefs
of
most
of
the
bands
performed
the
religious
ceremonies
themselves
but
the
kaets
delegated
them
to
certain
official
stranglers
chaurs
the
rites
of
the
kaets
were
so
holy
that
no
one
but
the
chaur
was
allowed
to
touch
the
vessels
and
other
things
used
in
them
thug
methods
exhibit
a
curious
mixture
of
caution
and
the
absence
of
it
cold
business
calculation
and
sudden
unreflecting
impulse
but
there
were
two
details
which
were
constant
and
not
subject
to
caprice
patient
persistence
in
following
up
the
prey
and
pitilessness
when
the
time
came
to
act
caution
was
exhibited
in
the
strength
of
the
bands
they
never
felt
comfortable
and
confident
unless
their
strength
exceeded
that
of
any
party
of
travelers
they
were
likely
to
meet
by
four
or
fivefold
yet
it
was
never
their
purpose
to
attack
openly
but
only
when
the
victims
were
off
their
guard
when
they
got
hold
of
a
party
of
travelers
they
often
moved
along
in
their
company
several
days
using
all
manner
of
arts
to
win
their
friendship
and
get
their
confidence
at
last
when
this
was
accomplished
to
their
satisfaction
the
real
business
began
a
few
thugs
were
privately
detached
and
sent
forward
in
the
dark
to
select
a
good
killing
place
and
dig
the
graves
when
the
rest
reached
the
spot
a
halt
was
called
for
a
rest
or
a
smoke
the
travelers
were
invited
to
sit
by
signs
the
chief
appointed
certain
thugs
to
sit
down
in
front
of
the
travelers
as
if
to
wait
upon
them
others
to
sit
down
beside
them
and
engage
them
in
conversation
and
certain
expert
stranglers
to
stand
behind
the
travelers
and
be
ready
when
the
signal
was
given
the
signal
was
usually
some
commonplace
remark
like
bring
the
tobacco
sometimes
a
considerable
wait
ensued
after
all
the
actors
were
in
their
places
the
chief
was
biding
his
time
in
order
to
make
everything
sure
meantime
the
talk
droned
on
dim
figures
moved
about
in
the
dull
light
peace
and
tranquility
reigned
the
travelers
resigned
themselves
to
the
pleasant
reposefulness
and
comfort
of
the
situation
unconscious
of
the
death
angels
standing
motionless
at
their
backs
the
time
was
ripe
now
and
the
signal
came
bring
the
tobacco
there
was
a
mute
swift
movement
all
in
the
same
instant
the
men
at
each
victim's
sides
seized
his
hands
the
man
in
front
seized
his
feet
and
pulled
the
man
at
his
back
whipped
the
cloth
around
his
neck
and
gave
it
a
twist
the
head
sunk
forward
the
tragedy
was
over
the
bodies
were
stripped
and
covered
up
in
the
graves
the
spoil
packed
for
transportation
then
the
thugs
gave
pious
thanks
to
bhowanee
and
departed
on
further
holy
service
the
report
shows
that
the
travelers
moved
in
exceedingly
small
groups
twos
threes
fours
as
a
rule
a
party
with
a
dozen
in
it
was
rare
the
thugs
themselves
seem
to
have
been
the
only
people
who
moved
in
force
they
went
about
in
gangs
of
10
15
25
40
60
100
150
200
250
and
one
gang
of
310
is
mentioned
considering
their
numbers
their
catch
was
not
extraordinary
particularly
when
you
consider
that
they
were
not
in
the
least
fastidious
but
took
anybody
they
could
get
whether
rich
or
poor
and
sometimes
even
killed
children
now
and
then
they
killed
women
but
it
was
considered
sinful
to
do
it
and
unlucky
the
season
was
six
or
eight
months
long
one
season
the
half
dozen
bundelkand
and
gwalior
gangs
aggregated
712
men
and
they
murdered
210
people
one
season
the
malwa
and
kandeish
gangs
aggregated
702
men
and
they
murdered
232
one
season
the
kandeish
and
berar
gangs
aggregated
963
men
and
they
murdered
385
people

about

the
sacred
caste
of

respected
by
either

nor
yet
the
character
of
that
mendicant
that
byragee
a
beggar
is
a
holy
creature
and
some
of
the
gangs
spared
him
on
that
account
no
matter
how
slack
business
might
be
but
other
gangs
slaughtered
not
only
him
but
even
that
sacredest
of
sacred
creatures
the
fakeer
that
repulsive
skin
and
bone
thing
that
goes
around
naked
and
mats
his
bushy
hair
with
dust
and
dirt
and
so
beflours
his
lean
body
with
ashes
that
he
looks
like
a
specter
sometimes
a
fakeer
trusted
a
shade
too
far
in
the
protection
of
his
sacredness
in
the
middle
of
a
tally
sheet
of
feringhea's
who
had
been
out
with
forty
thugs
i
find
a
case
of
the
kind
after
the
killing
of
thirty
nine
men
and
one
woman
the
fakeer
appears
on
the
scene
approaching
doregow
met
3
pundits
also
a
fakeer
mounted
on
a
pony
he
was
plastered
over
with
sugar
to
collect
flies
and
was
covered
with
them
drove
off
the
fakeer
and
killed
the
other
three
leaving
doregow
the
fakeer
joined
again
and
went
on
in
company
to
raojana
met
6
khutries
on
their
way
from
bombay
to
nagpore
drove
off
the
fakeer
with
stones
and
killed
the
6
men
in
camp
and
buried
them
in
the
grove
next
day
the
fakeer
joined
again
made
him
leave
at
mana
beyond
there
fell
in
with
two
kahars
and
a
sepoy
and
came
on
towards
the
place
selected
for
the
murder
when
near
it
the
fakeer
came
again
losing
all
patience
with
him
gave
mithoo
one
of
the
gang
5
rupees
$2
50
to
murder
him
and
take
the
sin
upon
himself
all
four
were
strangled
including
the
fakeer
surprised
to
find
among
the
fakeer's
effects
30
pounds
of
coral
350
strings
of
small
pearls
15
strings
of
large
pearls
and
a
gilt
necklace
it
it
curious
the
little
effect
that
time
has
upon
a
really
interesting
circumstance
this
one
so
old
so
long
ago
gone
down
into
oblivion
reads
with
the
same
freshness
and
charm
that
attach
to
the
news
in
the
morning
paper
one's
spirits
go
up
then
down
then
up
again
following
the
chances
which
the
fakeer
is
running
now
you
hope
now
you
despair
now
you
hope
again
and
at
last
everything
comes
out
right
and
you
feel
a
great
wave
of
personal
satisfaction
go
weltering
through
you
and
without
thinking
you
put
out
your
hand
to
pat
mithoo
on
the
back
when
puff!
the
whole
thing
has
vanished
away
there
is
nothing
there
mithoo
and
all
the
crowd
have
been
dust
and
ashes
and
forgotten
oh
so
many
many
many
lagging
years!
and
then
comes
a
sense
of
injury
you
don't
know
whether
mithoo
got
the
swag
along
with
the
sin
or
had
to
divide
up
the
swag
and
keep
all
the
sin
himself
there
is
no
literary
art
about
a
government
report
it
stops
a
story
right
in
the
most
interesting
place
these
reports
of
thug
expeditions
run
along
interminably
in
one
monotonous
tune
met
a
sepoy
killed
him
met
5
pundits
killed
them
met
4
rajpoots
and
a
woman
killed
them
and
so
on
till
the
statistics
get
to
be
pretty
dry
but
this
small
trip
of
feringhea's
forty
had
some
little
variety
about
it
once
they
came
across
a
man
hiding
in
a
grave
a
thief
he
had
stolen
1
100
rupees
from
dhunroj
seith
of
parowtee
they
strangled
him
and
took
the
money
they
had
no
patience
with
thieves
they
killed
two
treasure
bearers
and
got
4
000
rupees
they
came
across
two
bullocks
laden
with
copper
pice
and
killed
the
four
drivers
and
took
the
money
there
must
have
been
half
a
ton
of
it
i
think
it
takes
a
double
handful
of
pice
to
make
an
anna
and
16
annas
to
make
a
rupee
and
even
in
those
days
the
rupee
was
worth
only
half
a
dollar
coming
back
over
their
tracks
from
baroda
they
had
another
picturesque
stroke
of
luck
'the
lohars
of
oodeypore'
put
a
traveler
in
their
charge
for
safety
dear
dear
across
this
abyssmal
gulf
of
time
we
still
see
feringhea's
lips
uncover
his
teeth
and
through
the
dim
haze
we
catch
the
incandescent
glimmer
of
his
smile
he
accepted
that
trust
good
man
and
so
we
know
what
went
with
the
traveler
even
rajahs
had
no
terrors
for
feringhea
he
came
across
an
elephant
driver
belonging
to
the
rajah
of
oodeypore
and
promptly
strangled
him
a
total
of
100
men
and
5
women
murdered
on
this
expedition
among
the
reports
of
expeditions
we
find
mention
of
victims
of
almost
every
quality
and
estate
also
a
prince's
cook
and
even
the
water
carrier
of
that
sublime
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
the
governor
general
of
india!
how
broad
they
were
in
their
tastes!
they
also
murdered
actors
poor
wandering
barnstormers
there
are
two
instances
recorded
the
first
one
by
a
gang
of
thugs
under
a
chief
who
soils
a
great
name
borne
by
a
better
man
kipling's
deathless
gungadin
after
murdering
4
sepoys
going
on
toward
indore
met
4
strolling
players
and
persuaded
them
to
come
with
us
on
the
pretense
that
we
would
see
their
performance
at
the
next
stage
murdered
them
at
a
temple
near
bhopal
second
instance
at
deohuttee
joined
by
comedians
murdered
them
eastward
of
that
place
but
this
gang
was
a
particularly
bad
crew
on
that
expedition
they
murdered
a
fakeer
and
twelve
beggars
and
yet
bhowanee
protected
them
for
once
when
they
were
strangling
a
man
in
a
wood
when
a
crowd
was
going
by
close
at
hand
and
the
noose
slipped
and
the
man
screamed
bhowanee
made
a
camel
burst
out
at
the
same
moment
with
a
roar
that
drowned
the
scream
and
before
the
man
could
repeat
it
the
breath
was
choked
out

the
cow
is
so
sacred

that
to
kill
her
keeper
is
an
awful
sacrilege
and
even
the

recognized
this

and
then
the
lust
for
blood
was
too
strong
and
so
they
did
kill
a

of

the

we
may
even
hope
for
a
day
many
centuries
hence
when
our

will
look
down
upon
us
in
the
same
way
there
are
many
indications
that
the

often
hunted
men
for
the
mere
sport
of
it
that
the
fright
and
pain
of
the
quarry
were
no
more
to
him
than
are
the
fright

pain
of
the
rabbit
or
the
stag
to
us
and
that
he
was
no
more
ashamed
of
beguiling
his
game
with
deceits
and
abusing
its
trust
than
are
we
when
we
have
imitated

followed

for
about
twenty
days
in
search
of
travelers
until
we
came
to
selempore
where
we
met
a
very
old
man
going
to
the
east
we
won
his
confidence
in
this
manner
he
carried
a
load
which
was
too
heavy
for
his
old
age
i
said
to
him
'you

i
will
aid
you
in
carrying
your
load
as
you
are
from
my
part

'
he
said
'very
well
take
me
with
you
'
so
we
took
him
with
us
to
selempore
where
we
slept
that
night
we
woke
him
next
morning
before
dawn
and
set
out
and
at
the
distance
of
three
miles
we
seated
him
to
rest
while
it
was

is
an
instance
i
ramzam
and
hyder
set
out
for
the
purpose
of
strangling
travelers
from
guddapore
and
proceeded
via
the
fort
of

newulgunge
bangermow
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
upwards
of
100
miles
from
whence
we
returned
by
another
route
still
no
travelers!
till
we
reached
bowaneegunge
where
we
fell
in
with
a
traveler
a
boatman
we
inveigled
him
and
about
two
miles
east
of
there
hyder
strangled
him
as
he
stood
for
he
was
troubled
and
afraid
and
would
not
sit
we
then
made
a
long
journey
about
130
miles
and
reached
hussunpore
bundwa
where
at
the
tank
we
fell
in
with
a
traveler
he
slept
there
that
night
next
morning
we
followed
him
and
tried
to
win
his
confidence
at
the
distance
of
two
miles
we
endeavored
to
induce
him
to
sit
down
but
he
would
not
having
become
aware
of
us
i
attempted
to
strangle
him
as
he
walked
along
but
did
not
succeed
both
of
us
then
fell
upon
him
he
made
a
great
outcry
'they
are
murdering
me!'
at
length
we
strangled
him
and
flung
his
body
into
a
well
after
this
we
returned
to
our
homes
having
been
out
a
month
and
traveled
about
260
miles
a
total
of
two
men
murdered
on
the
expedition
and
here
is
another
case
related
by
the
terrible
futty
khan
a
man
with
a
tremendous
record
to
be
re
mentioned
by
and
by
i
with
three
others
traveled
for
about
45
days
a
distance
of
about
200
miles
in
search
of
victims
along
the
highway
to
bundwa
and
returned
by
davodpore
another
200
miles
during
which
journey
we
had
only
one
murder
which
happened
in
this
manner
four
miles
to
the
east
of
noubustaghat
we
fell
in
with
a
traveler
an
old
man
i
with
koshal
and
hyder
inveigled
him
and
accompanied
him
that
day
within
3
miles
of
rampoor
where
after
dark
in
a
lonely
place
we
got
him
to
sit
down
and
rest
and
while
i
kept
him
in
talk
seated
before
him
hyder
behind
strangled
him
he
made
no
resistance
koshal
stabbed
him
under
the
arms
and
in
the
throat
and
we
flung
the
body
into
a
running
stream
we
got
about
4
or
5
rupees
each
$2
or
$2
50
we
then
proceeded
homewards
a
total
of
one
man
murdered
on
this
expedition
there
they
tramped
400
miles
were
gone
about
three
months
and
harvested
two
dollars
and
a
half
apiece
but
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
hunt
was
sufficient
that
was
pay
enough
they
did
no
grumbling
every
now
and
then
in
this
big
book
one
comes
across
that
pathetic
remark
we
tried
to
get
him
to
sit
down
but
he
would
not
it
tells
the
whole
story
some
accident
had
awakened
the
suspicion
in
him
that
these
smooth
friends
who
had
been
petting
and
coddling
him
and
making
him
feel
so
safe
and
so
fortunate
after
his
forlorn
and
lonely
wanderings
were
the
dreaded
thugs
and
now
their
ghastly
invitation
to
sit
and
rest
had
confirmed
its
truth
he
knew
there
was
no
help
for
him
and
that
he
was
looking
his
last
upon
earthly
things
but
he
would
not
sit
no
not
that
it
was
too
awful
to
think
of!
there
are
a
number
of
instances
which
indicate
that
when
a
man
had
once
tasted
the
regal
joys
of
man
hunting
he
could
not
be
content
with
the
dull
monotony
of
a
crimeless
life
after
ward
example
from
a
thug's
testimony
we
passed
through
to
kurnaul
where
we
found
a
former
thug
named
junooa
an
old
comrade
of
ours
who
had
turned
religious
mendicant
and
become
a
disciple
and
holy
he
came
to
us
in
the
serai
and
weeping
with
joy
returned
to
his
old
trade
neither
wealth
nor
honors
nor
dignities
could
satisfy
a
reformed
thug
for
long
he
would
throw
them
all
away
someday
and
go
back
to
the
lurid
pleasures
of
hunting
men
and
being
hunted
himself
by
the
british
ramzam
was
taken
into
a
great
native
grandee's
service
and
given
authority
over
five
villages
my
authority
extended
over
these
people
to
summons
them
to
my
presence
to
make
them
stand
or
sit
i
dressed
well
rode
my
pony
and
had
two
sepoys
a
scribe
and
a
village
guard
to
attend
me
during
three
years
i
used
to
pay
each
village
a
monthly
visit
and
no
one
suspected
that
i
was
a
thug!
the
chief
man
used
to
wait
on
me
to
transact
business
and
as
i
passed
along
old
and
young
made
their
salaam
to
me
and
yet
during
that
very
three
years
he
got
leave
of
absence
to
attend
a
wedding
and
instead
went
off
on
a
thugging
lark
with
six
other
thugs
and
hunted
the
highway
for
fifteen
days!
with
satisfactory
results
afterwards
he
held
a
great
office
under
a
rajah
there
he
had
ten
miles
of
country
under
his
command
and
a
military
guard
of
fifteen
men
with
authority
to
call
out
2
000
more
upon
occasion
but
the
british
got
on
his
track
and
they
crowded
him
so
that
he
had
to
give
himself
up
see
what
a
figure
he
was
when
he
was
gotten
up
for
style
and
had
all
his
things
on
i
was
fully
armed
a
sword
shield
pistols
a
matchlock
musket
and
a
flint
gun
for
i
was
fond
of
being
thus
arrayed
and
when
so
armed
feared
not
though
forty
men
stood
before
me
he
gave
himself
up
and
proudly
proclaimed
himself
a
thug
then
by
request
he
agreed
to
betray
his
friend
and
pal
buhram
a
thug
with
the
most
tremendous
record
in
india
i
went
to
the
house
where
buhram
slept
often
has
he
led
our
gangs!
i
woke
him
he
knew
me
well
and
came
outside
to
me
it
was
a
cold
night
so
under
pretence
of
warming
myself
but
in
reality
to
have
light
for
his
seizure
by
the
guards
i
lighted
some
straw
and
made
a
blaze
we
were
warming
our
hands
the
guards
drew
around
us
i
said
to
them
'this
is
buhram
'
and
he
was
seized
just
as
a
cat
seizes
a
mouse
then
buhram
said
'i
am
a
thug!
my
father
was
a
thug
my
grandfather
was
a
thug
and
i
have
thugged
with
many!'
so
spoke
the
mighty
hunter
the
mightiest
of
the
mighty
the
gordon
cumming
of
his
day
not
much
regret
noticeable
in
it

planted
a
bullet
in
the
shoulder

caused
the
agonized

to
lean

i
proceeded
to
brew
some
coffee

refreshed
myself
taking
observations
of
the
elephant's
spasms

writhings
between

i
resolved
to
make
experiments
on
vulnerable
points

approaching
very
near
i
fired
several
bullets
at

parts

enormous
skull
he
only
acknowledged
the
shots

his
trunk

the
point

which
he
gently
touched

find
that
i
was
only
prolonging
the
suffering
of
the
noble
beast

bore
its
trials
with
such
dignified
composure
i
resolved
to
finish
the
proceeding
with
all
possible
despatch

accordingly
opened
fire
upon
him

the
left
side

at
the
shoulder

fired

shots

must
have
eventually
proved
mortal

i
fired
six
shots

part

tears
now
trickled
down
from
his
eyes

he
slowly
shut
and
opened

colossal
frame

convulsively
and
falling
on
his
side
he
expired

so
many
many
times
this
official
report
leaves
one's
curiosity
unsatisfied
for
instance
here
is
a
little
paragraph
out
of
the
record
of
a
certain
band
of
193
thugs
which
has
that
defect
fell
in
with
lall
sing
subahdar
and
his
family
consisting
of
nine
persons
traveled
with
them
two
days
and
the
third
put
them
all
to
death
except
the
two
children
little
boys
of
one
and
a
half
years
old
there
it
stops
what
did
they
do
with
those
poor
little
fellows
what
was
their
subsequent
history
did
they
purpose
training
them
up
as
thugs
how
could
they
take
care
of
such
little
creatures
on
a
march
which
stretched
over
several
months
no
one
seems
to
have
cared
to
ask
any
questions
about
the
babies
but
i
do
wish
i
knew
one
would
be
apt
to
imagine
that
the
thugs
were
utterly
callous
utterly
destitute
of
human
feelings
heartless
toward
their
own
families
as
well
as
toward
other
people's
but
this
was
not
so
like
all
other
indians
they
had
a
passionate
love
for
their
kin

shrewd

officer
who
knew
the
indian
character
took
that
characteristic
into
account
in
laying
his
plans
for
the
capture
of
eugene
sue's
famous
feringhea
he
found
out
feringhea's
hiding
place
and
sent
a
guard
by
night
to
seize
him
but
the
squad
was
awkward
and
he
got
away
however
they
got
the
rest
of
the
family
the
mother
wife
child
and
brother
and
brought
them
to
the
officer
at
jubbulpore
the
officer
did
not
fret
but
bided
his
time
i
knew
feringhea
would
not
go
far
while
links
so
dear
to
him
were
in
my
hands
he
was
right
feringhea
knew
all
the
danger
he
was
running
by
staying
in
the
neighborhood
still
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
the
officer
found
that
he
divided
his
time
between
five
villages
where
be
had
relatives
and
friends
who
could
get
news
for
him
from
his
family
in
jubbulpore
jail
and
that
he
never
slept
two
consecutive
nights
in
the
same
village
the
officer
traced
out
his
several
haunts
then
pounced
upon
all
the
five
villages
on
the
one
night
and
at
the
same
hour
and
got
his
man
another
example
of
family
affection
a
little
while
previously
to
the
capture
of
feringhea's
family
the
british
officer
had
captured
feringhea's
foster
brother
leader
of
a
gang
of
ten
and
had
tried
the
eleven
and
condemned
them
to
be
hanged
feringhea's
captured
family
arrived
at
the
jail
the
day
before
the
execution
was
to
take
place
the
foster
brother
jhurhoo
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
aged
mother
and
the
others
the
prayer
was
granted
and
this
is
what
took
place
it
is
the
british
officer
who
speaks
in
the
morning
just
before
going
to
the
scaffold
the
interview
took
place
before
me
he
fell
at
the
old
woman's
feet
and
begged
that
she
would
relieve
him
from
the
obligations
of
the
milk
with
which
she
had
nourished
him
from
infancy
as
he
was
about
to
die
before
he
could
fulfill
any
of
them
she
placed
her
hands
on
his
head
and
he
knelt
and
she
said
she
forgave
him
all
and
bid
him
die
like
a
man
if
a
capable
artist
should
make
a
picture
of
it
it
would
be
full
of
dignity
and
solemnity
and
pathos
and
it
could
touch
you
you
would
imagine
it
to
be
anything
but
what
it
was
there
is
reverence
there
and
tenderness
and
gratefulness
and
compassion
and
resignation
and
fortitude
and
self
respect
and
no
sense
of
disgrace
no
thought
of
dishonor
everything
is
there
that
goes
to
make
a
noble
parting
and
give
it
a
moving
grace
and
beauty
and
dignity
and
yet
one
of
these
people
is
a
thug
and
the
other
a
mother
of
thugs!
the
incongruities
of
our
human
nature
seem
to
reach
their
limit
here
i
wish
to
make
note
of
one
curious
thing
while
i
think
of
it
one
of
the
very
commonest
remarks
to
be
found
in
this
bewildering
array
of
thug
confessions
is
this
strangled
him
and
threw
him
an
a
well!
in
one
case
they
threw
sixteen
into
a
well
and
they
had
thrown
others
in
the
same
well
before
it
makes
a
body
thirsty
to
read
about
it
and
there
is
another
very
curious
thing
the
bands
of
thugs
had
private
graveyards
they
did
not
like
to
kill
and
bury
at
random
here
and
there
and
everywhere
they
preferred
to
wait
and
toll
the
victims
along
and
get
to
one
of
their
regular
burying
places
'bheels'
if
they
could
in
the
little
kingdom
of
oude
which
was
about
half
as
big
as
ireland
and
about
as
big
as
the
state
of
maine
they
had
two
hundred
and
seventy
four
'bheels'
they
were
scattered
along
fourteen
hundred
miles
of
road
at
an
average
of
only
five
miles
apart
and
the
british
government
traced
out
and
located
each
and
every
one
of
them
and
set
them
down
on
the
map
the
oude
bands
seldom
went
out
of
their
own
country
but
they
did
a
thriving
business
within
its
borders
so
did
outside
bands
who
came
in
and
helped
some
of
the
thug
leaders
of
oude
were
noted
for
their
successful
careers
each
of
four
of
them
confessed
to
above
300
murders
another
to
nearly
400
our
friend
ramzam
to
604
he
is
the
one
who
got
leave
of
absence
to
attend
a
wedding
and
went
thugging
instead
and
he
is
also
the
one
who
betrayed
buhram
to
the
british
but
the
biggest
records
of
all
were
the
murder
lists
of
futty
khan
and
buhram
futty
khan's
number
is
smaller
than
ramzam's
but
he
is
placed
at
the
head
because
his
average
is
the
best
in
oude
thug
history
per
year
of
service
his
slaughter
was
508
men
in
twenty
years
and
he
was
still
a
young
man
when
the
british
stopped
his
industry
buhram's
list
was
931
murders
but
it
took
him
forty
years
his
average
was
one
man
and
nearly
all
of
another
man
per
month
for
forty
years
but
futty
khan's
average
was
two
men
and
a
little
of
another
man
per
month
during
his
twenty
years
of
usefulness
there
is
one
very
striking
thing
which
i
wish
to
call
attention
to
you
have
surmised
from
the
listed
callings
followed
by
the
victims
of
the
thugs
that
nobody
could
travel
the
indian
roads
unprotected
and
live
to
get
through
that
the
thugs
respected
no
quality
no
vocation
no
religion
nobody
that
they
killed
every
unarmed
man
that
came
in
their
way
that
is
wholly
true
with
one
reservation
in
all
the
long
file
of
thug
confessions
an
english
traveler
is
mentioned
but
once
and
this
is
what
the
thug
says
of
the
circumstance
he
was
on
his
way
from
mhow
to
bombay
we
studiously
avoided
him
he
proceeded
next
morning
with
a
number
of
travelers
who
had
sought
his
protection
and
they
took
the
road
to
baroda
we
do
not
know
who
he
was
he
flits
across
the
page
of
this
rusty
old
book
and
disappears
in
the
obscurity
beyond
but
he
is
an
impressive
figure
moving
through
that
valley
of
death
serene
and
unafraid
clothed
in
the
might
of
the
english
name
we
have
now
followed
the
big
official
book
through
and
we
understand
what
thuggee
was
what
a
bloody
terror
it
was
what
a
desolating
scourge
it
was
in
1830
the
english
found
this
cancerous
organization
imbedded
in
the
vitals
of
the
empire
doing
its
devastating
work
in
secrecy
and
assisted
protected
sheltered
and
hidden
by
innumerable
confederates
big
and
little
native
chiefs
customs
officers
village
officials
and
native
police
all
ready
to
lie
for
it
and
the
mass
of
the
people
through
fear
persistently
pretending
to
know
nothing
about
its
doings
and
this
condition
of
things
had
existed
for
generations
and
was
formidable
with
the
sanctions
of
age
and
old
custom
if
ever
there
was
an
unpromising
task
if
ever
there
was
a
hopeless
task
in
the
world
surely
it
was
offered
here
the
task
of
conquering
thuggee
but
that
little
handful
of
english
officials
in
india
set
their
sturdy
and
confident
grip
upon
it
and
ripped
it
out
root
and
branch!
how
modest
do
captain
vallancey's
words
sound
now
when
we
read
them
again
knowing
what
we
know
the
day
that
sees
this
far
spread
evil
completely
eradicated
from
india
and
known
only
in
name
will
greatly
tend
to
immortalize
british
rule
in
the
east
it
would
be
hard
to
word
a
claim
more
modestly
than
that
for
this
most
noble
work
chapter
xlviii
grief
can
take
care
of
itself
but
to
get
the
full
value
of
a
joy
you
must
have
somebody
to
divide
it
with
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
we
left
bombay
for
allahabad
by
a
night
train
it
is
the
custom
of
the
country
to
avoid
day
travel
when
it
can
conveniently
be
done
but
there
is
one
trouble
while
you
can
seemingly
secure
the
two
lower
berths
by
making
early
application
there
is
no
ticket
as
witness
of
it
and
no
other
producible
evidence
in
case
your
proprietorship
shall
chance
to
be
challenged
the
word
engaged
appears
on
the
window
but
it
doesn't
state
who
the
compartment
is
engaged
for
if
your
satan
and
your
barney
arrive
before
somebody
else's
servants
and
spread
the
bedding
on
the
two
sofas
and
then
stand
guard
till
you
come
all
will
be
well
but
if
they
step
aside
on
an
errand
they
may
find
the
beds
promoted
to
the
two
shelves
and
somebody
else's
demons
standing
guard
over
their
master's
beds
which
in
the
meantime
have
been
spread
upon
your
sofas
you
do
not
pay
anything
extra
for
your
sleeping
place
that
is
where
the
trouble
lies
if
you
buy
a
fare
ticket
and
fail
to
use
it
there
is
room
thus
made
available
for
someone
else
but
if
the
place
were
secured
to
you
it
would
remain
vacant
and
yet
your
ticket
would
secure
you
another
place
when
you
were
presently
ready
to
travel
however
no
explanation
of
such
a
system
can
make
it
seem
quite
rational
to
a
person
who
has
been
used
to
a
more
rational
system
if
our
people
had
the
arranging
of
it
we
should
charge
extra
for
securing
the
place
and
then
the
road
would
suffer
no
loss
if
the
purchaser
did
not
occupy
it
the
present
system
encourages
good
manners
and
also
discourages
them
if
a
young
girl
has
a
lower
berth
and
an
elderly
lady
comes
in
it
is
usual
for
the
girl
to
offer
her
place
to
this
late
comer
and
it
is
usual
for
the
late
comer
to
thank
her
courteously
and
take
it
but
the
thing
happens
differently
sometimes
when
we
were
ready
to
leave
bombay
my
daughter's
satchels
were
holding
possession
of
her
berth
a
lower
one
at
the
last
moment
a
middle
aged
american
lady
swarmed
into
the
compartment
followed
by
native
porters
laden
with
her
baggage
she
was
growling
and
snarling
and
scolding
and
trying
to
make
herself
phenomenally
disagreeable
and
succeeding
without
a
word
she
hoisted
the
satchels
into
the
hanging
shelf
and
took
possession
of
that
lower
berth
on
one
of
our
trips
mr
smythe
and
i
got
out
at
a
station
to
walk
up
and
down
and
when
we
came
back
smythe's
bed
was
in
the
hanging
shelf
and
an
english
cavalry
officer
was
in
bed
on
the
sofa
which
he
had
lately
been
occupying
it
was
mean
to
be
glad
about
it
but
it
is
the
way
we
are
made
i
could
not
have
been
gladder
if
it
had
been
my
enemy
that
had
suffered
this
misfortune
we
all
like
to
see
people
in
trouble
if
it
doesn't
cost
us
anything
i
was
so
happy
over
mr
smythe's
chagrin
that
i
couldn't
go
to
sleep
for
thinking
of
it
and
enjoying
it
i
knew
he
supposed
the
officer
had
committed
the
robbery
himself
whereas
without
a
doubt
the
officer's
servant
had
done
it
without
his
knowledge
mr
smythe
kept
this
incident
warm
in
his
heart
and
longed
for
a
chance
to
get
even
with
somebody
for
it
sometime
afterward
the
opportunity
came
in
calcutta
we
were
leaving
on
a
24
hour
journey
to
darjeeling
mr
barclay
the
general
superintendent
has
made
special
provision
for
our
accommodation
mr
smythe
said
so
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
about
getting
to
the
train
consequently
we
were
a
little
late
when
we
arrived
the
usual
immense
turmoil
and
confusion
of
a
great
indian
station
were
in
full
blast
it
was
an
immoderately
long
train
for
all
the
natives
of
india
were
going
by
it
somewhither
and
the
native
officials
were
being
pestered
to
frenzy
by
belated
and
anxious
people
they
didn't
know
where
our
car
was
and
couldn't
remember
having
received
any
orders
about
it
it
was
a
deep
disappointment
moreover
it
looked
as
if
our
half
of
our
party
would
be
left
behind
altogether
then
satan
came
running
and
said
he
had
found
a
compartment
with
one
shelf
and
one
sofa
unoccupied
and
had
made
our
beds
and
had
stowed
our
baggage
we
rushed
to
the
place
and
just
as
the
train
was
ready
to
pull
out
and
the
porters
were
slamming
the
doors
to
all
down
the
line
an
officer
of
the
indian
civil
service
a
good
friend
of
ours
put
his
head
in
and
said
i
have
been
hunting
for
you
everywhere
what
are
you
doing
here
don't
you
know
the
train
started
before
he
could
finish
mr
smythe's
opportunity
was
come
his
bedding
on
the
shelf
at
once
changed
places
with
the
bedding
a
stranger's
that
was
occupying
the
sofa
that
was
opposite
to
mine
about
ten
o'clock
we
stopped
somewhere
and
a
large
englishman
of
official
military
bearing
stepped
in
we
pretended
to
be
asleep
the
lamps
were
covered
but
there
was
light
enough
for
us
to
note
his
look
of
surprise
he
stood
there
grand
and
fine
peering
down
at
smythe
and
wondering
in
silence
at
the
situation
after
a
bit
be
said
well!
and
that
was
all
but
that
was
enough
it
was
easy
to
understand
it
meant
this
is
extraordinary
this
is
high
handed
i
haven't
had
an
experience
like
this
before
he
sat
down
on
his
baggage
and
for
twenty
minutes
we
watched
him
through
our
eyelashes
rocking
and
swaying
there
to
the
motion
of
the
train
then
we
came
to
a
station
and
he
got
up
and
went
out
muttering
i
must
find
a
lower
berth
or
wait
over
his
servant
came
presently
and
carried
away
his
things
mr
smythe's
sore
place
was
healed
his
hunger
for
revenge
was
satisfied
but
he
couldn't
sleep
and
neither
could
i
for
this
was
a
venerable
old
car
and
nothing
about
it
was
taut
the
closet
door
slammed
all
night
and
defied
every
fastening
we
could
invent
we
got
up
very
much
jaded
at
dawn
and
stepped
out
at
a
way
station
and
while
we
were
taking
a
cup
of
coffee
that
englishman
ranged
up
alongside
and
somebody
said
to
him
so
you
didn't
stop
off
after
all
no
the
guard
found
a
place
for
me
that
had
been
engaged
and
not
occupied
i
had
a
whole
saloon
car
all
to
myself
oh
quite
palatial!
i
never
had
such
luck
in
my
life
that
was
our
car
you
see
we
moved
into
it
straight
off
the
family
and
all
but
i
asked
the
english
gentleman
to
remain
and
he
did
a
pleasant
man
an
infantry
colonel
and
doesn't
know
yet
that
smythe
robbed
him
of
his
berth
but
thinks
it
was
done
by
smythe's
servant
without
smythe's
knowledge
he
was
assisted
in
gathering
this
impression
the
indian
trains
are
manned
by
natives
exclusively
the
indian
stations
except
very
large
and
important
ones
are
manned
entirely
by
natives
and
so
are
the
posts
and
telegraphs
the
rank
and
file
of
the
police
are
natives
all
these
people
are
pleasant
and
accommodating
one
day
i
left
an
express
train
to
lounge
about
in
that
perennially
ravishing
show
the
ebb
and
flow
and
whirl
of
gaudy
natives
that
is
always
surging
up
and
down
the
spacious
platform
of
a
great
indian
station
and
i
lost
myself
in
the
ecstasy
of
it
and
when
i
turned
the
train
was
moving
swiftly
away
i
was
going
to
sit
down
and
wait
for
another
train
as
i
would
have
done
at
home
i
had
no
thought
of
any
other
course
but
a
native
official
who
had
a
green
flag
in
his
hand
saw
me
and
said
politely
don't
you
belong
in
the
train
sir
yes
i
said
he
waved
his
flag
and
the
train
came
back!
and
he
put
me
aboard
with
as
much
ceremony
as
if
i
had
been
the
general
superintendent
they
are
kindly
people
the
natives
the
face
and
the
bearing
that
indicate
a
surly
spirit
and
a
bad
heart
seemed
to
me
to
be
so
rare
among
indians
so
nearly
non
existent
in
fact
that
i
sometimes
wondered
if
thuggee
wasn't
a
dream
and
not
a
reality
the
bad
hearts
are
there
but
i
believe
that
they
are
in
a
small
poor
minority
one
thing
is
sure
they
are
much
the
most
interesting
people
in
the
world
and
the
nearest
to
being
incomprehensible
at
any
rate
the
hardest
to
account
for
their
character
and
their
history
their
customs
and
their
religion
confront
you
with
riddles
at
every
turn
riddles
which
are
a
trifle
more
perplexing
after
they
are
explained
than
they
were
before
you
can
get
the
facts
of
a
custom
like
caste
and
suttee
and
thuggee
and
so
on
and
with
the
facts
a
theory
which
tries
to
explain
but
never
quite
does
it
to
your
satisfaction
you
can
never
quite
understand
how
so
strange
a
thing
could
have
been
born
nor
why
for
instance
the
suttee
this
is
the
explanation
of
it
a
woman
who
throws
away
her
life
when
her
husband
dies
is
instantly
joined
to
him
again
and
is
forever
afterward
happy
with
him
in
heaven
her
family
will
build
a
little
monument
to
her
or
a
temple
and
will
hold
her
in
honor
and
indeed
worship
her
memory
always
they
will
themselves
be
held
in
honor
by
the
public
the
woman's
self
sacrifice
has
conferred
a
noble
and
lasting
distinction
upon
her
posterity
and
besides
see
what
she
has
escaped
if
she
had
elected
to
live
she
would
be
a
disgraced
person
she
could
not
remarry
her
family
would
despise
her
and
disown
her
she
would
be
a
friendless
outcast
and
miserable
all
her
days
very
well
you
say
but
the
explanation
is
not
complete
yet
how
did
people
come
to
drift
into
such
a
strange
custom
what
was
the
origin
of
the
idea
well
nobody
knows
it
was
probably
a
revelation
sent
down
by
the
gods
one
more
thing
why
was
such
a
cruel
death
chosen
why
wouldn't
a
gentle
one
have
answered
nobody
knows
maybe
that
was
a
revelation
too
no
you
can
never
understand
it
it
all
seems
impossible
you
resolve
to
believe
that
a
widow
never
burnt
herself
willingly
but
went
to
her
death
because
she
was
afraid
to
defy
public
opinion
but
you
are
not
able
to
keep
that
position
history
drives
you
from
it
major
sleeman
has
a
convincing
case
in
one
of
his
books
in
his
government
on
the
nerbudda
he
made
a
brave
attempt
on
the
28th
of
march
1828
to
put
down
suttee
on
his
own
hook
and
without
warrant
from
the
supreme
government
of
india
he
could
not
foresee
that
the
government
would
put
it
down
itself
eight
months
later
the
only
backing
he
had
was
a
bold
nature
and
a
compassionate
heart
he
issued
his
proclamation
abolishing
the
suttee
in
his
district
on
the
morning
of
tuesday
note
the
day
of
the
week
the
24th
of
the
following
november
ummed
singh
upadhya
head
of
the
most
respectable
and
most
extensive
brahmin
family
in
the
district
died
and
presently
came
a
deputation
of
his
sons
and
grandsons
to
beg
that
his
old
widow
might
be
allowed
to
burn
herself
upon
his
pyre
sleeman
threatened
to
enforce
his
order
and
punish
severely
any
man
who
assisted
and
he
placed
a
police
guard
to
see
that
no
one
did
so
from
the
early
morning
the
old
widow
of
sixty
five
had
been
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
sacred
river
by
her
dead
waiting
through
the
long
hours
for
the
permission
and
at
last
the
refusal
came
instead
in
one
little
sentence
sleeman
gives
you
a
pathetic
picture
of
this
lonely
old
gray
figure
all
day
and
all
night
she
remained
sitting
by
the
edge
of
the
water
without
eating
or
drinking
the
next
morning
the
body
of
the
husband
was
burned
to
ashes
in
a
pit
eight
feet
square
and
three
or
four
feet
deep
in
the
view
of
several
thousand
spectators
then
the
widow
waded
out
to
a
bare
rock
in
the
river
and
everybody
went
away
but
her
sons
and
other
relations
all
day
she
sat
there
on
her
rock
in
the
blazing
sun
without
food
or
drink
and
with
no
clothing
but
a
sheet
over
her
shoulders
the
relatives
remained
with
her
and
all
tried
to
persuade
her
to
desist
from
her
purpose
for
they
deeply
loved
her
she
steadily
refused
then
a
part
of
the
family
went
to
sleeman's
house
ten
miles
away
and
tried
again
to
get
him
to
let
her
burn
herself
he
refused
hoping
to
save
her
yet
all
that
day
she
scorched
in
her
sheet
on
the
rock
and
all
that
night
she
kept
her
vigil
there
in
the
bitter
cold
thursday
morning
in
the
sight
of
her
relatives
she
went
through
a
ceremonial
which
said
more
to
them
than
any
words
could
have
done
she
put
on
the
dhaja
a
coarse
red
turban
and
broke
her
bracelets
in
pieces
by
these
acts
she
became
a
dead
person
in
the
eye
of
the
law
and
excluded
from
her
caste
forever
by
the
iron
rule
of
ancient
custom
if
she
should
now
choose
to
live
she
could
never
return
to
her
family
sleeman
was
in
deep
trouble
if
she
starved
herself
to
death
her
family
would
be
disgraced
and
moreover
starving
would
be
a
more
lingering
misery
than
the
death
by
fire
he
went
back
in
the
evening
thoroughly
worried
the
old
woman
remained
on
her
rock
and
there
in
the
morning
he
found
her
with
her
dhaja
still
on
her
head
she
talked
very
collectedly
telling
me
that
she
had
determined
to
mix
her
ashes
with
those
of
her
departed
husband
and
should
patiently
wait
my
permission
to
do
so
assured
that
god
would
enable
her
to
sustain
life
till
that
was
given
though
she
dared
not
eat
or
drink
looking
at
the
sun
then
rising
before
her
over
a
long
and
beautiful
reach
of
the
river
she
said
calmly
'my
soul
has
been
for
five
days
with
my
husband's
near
that
sun
nothing
but
my
earthly
frame
is
left
and
this
i
know
you
will
in
time
suffer
to
be
mixed
with
his
ashes
in
yonder
pit
because
it
is
not
in
your
nature
or
usage
wantonly
to
prolong
the
miseries
of
a
poor
old
woman
'
he
assured
her
that
it
was
his
desire
and
duty
to
save
her
and
to
urge
her
to
live
and
to
keep
her
family
from
the
disgrace
of
being
thought
her
murderers
but
she
said
she
was
not
afraid
of
their
being
thought
so
that
they
had
all
like
good
children
done
everything
in
their
power
to
induce
her
to
live
and
to
abide
with
them
and
if
i
should
consent
i
know
they
would
love
and
honor
me
but
my
duties
to
them
have
now
ended
i
commit
them
all
to
your
care
and
i
go
to
attend
my
husband
ummed
singh
upadhya
with
whose
ashes
on
the
funeral
pile
mine
have
been
already
three
times
mixed
she
believed
that
she
and
he
had
been
upon
the
earth
three
several
times
as
wife
and
husband
and
that
she
had
burned
herself
to
death
three
times
upon
his
pyre
that
is
why
she
said
that
strange
thing
since
she
had
broken
her
bracelets
and
put
on
the
red
turban
she
regarded
herself
as
a
corpse
otherwise
she
would
not
have
allowed
herself
to
do
her
husband
the
irreverence
of
pronouncing
his
name
this
was
the
first
time
in
her
long
life
that
she
had
ever
uttered
her
husband's
name
for
in
india
no
woman
high
or
low
ever
pronounces
the
name
of
her
husband
major
sleeman
still
tried
to
shake
her
purpose
he
promised
to
build
her
a
fine
house
among
the
temples
of
her
ancestors
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
and
make
handsome
provision
for
her
out
of
rent
free
lands
if
she
would
consent
to
live
and
if
she
wouldn't
he
would
allow
no
stone
or
brick
to
ever
mark
the
place
where
she
died
but
she
only
smiled
and
said
my
pulse
has
long
ceased
to
beat
my
spirit
has
departed
i
shall
suffer
nothing
in
the
burning
and
if
you
wish
proof
order
some
fire
and
you
shall
see
this
arm
consumed
without
giving
me
any
pain
sleeman
was
now
satisfied
that
he
could
not
alter
her
purpose
he
sent
for
all
the
chief
members
of
the
family
and
said
he
would
suffer
her
to
burn
herself
if
they
would
enter
into
a
written
engagement
to
abandon
the
suttee
in
their
family
thenceforth
they
agreed
the
papers
were
drawn
out
and
signed
and
at
noon
saturday
word
was
sent
to
the
poor
old
woman
she
seemed
greatly
pleased
the
ceremonies
of
bathing
were
gone
through
with
and
by
three
o'clock
she
was
ready
and
the
fire
was
briskly
burning
in
the
pit
she
had
now
gone
without
food
or
drink
during
more
than
four
days
and
a
half
she
came
ashore
from
her
rock
first
wetting
her
sheet
in
the
waters
of
the
sacred
river
for
without
that
safeguard
any
shadow
which
might
fall
upon
her
would
convey
impurity
to
her
then
she
walked
to
the
pit
leaning
upon
one
of
her
sons
and
a
nephew
the
distance
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
i
had
sentries
placed
all
around
and
no
other
person
was
allowed
to
approach
within
five
paces
she
came
on
with
a
calm
and
cheerful
countenance
stopped
once
and
casting
her
eyes
upwards
said
'why
have
they
kept
me
five
days
from
thee
my
husband
'
on
coming
to
the
sentries
her
supporters
stopped
and
remained
standing
she
moved
on
and
walked
once
around
the
pit
paused
a
moment
and
while
muttering
a
prayer
threw
some
flowers
into
the
fire
she
then
walked
up
deliberately
and
steadily
to
the
brink
stepped
into
the
centre
of
the
flame
sat
down
and
leaning
back
in
the
midst
as
if
reposing
upon
a
couch
was
consumed
without
uttering
a
shriek
or
betraying
one
sign
of
agony
it
is
fine
and
beautiful
it
compels
one's
reverence
and
respect
no
has
it
freely
and
without
compulsion
we
see
how
the
custom
once
started
could
continue
for
the
soul
of
it
is
that
stupendous
power
faith
faith
brought
to
the
pitch
of
effectiveness
by
the
cumulative
force
of
example
and
long
use
and
custom
but
we
cannot
understand
how
the
first
widows
came
to
take
to
it
that
is
a
perplexing
detail
sleeman
says
that
it
was
usual
to
play
music
at
the
suttee
but
that
the
white
man's
notion
that
this
was
to
drown
the
screams
of
the
martyr
is
not
correct
that
it
had
a
quite
different
purpose
it
was
believed
that
the
martyr
died
prophecying
that
the
prophecies
sometimes
foretold
disaster
and
it
was
considered
a
kindness
to
those
upon
whom
it
was
to
fall
to
drown
the
voice
and
keep
them
in
ignorance
of
the
misfortune
that
was
to
come

two

from

it
was
always
interesting
and
it
was

the

that

pyjamas
in
order
to
be
in

i

to
give
them
up
i
couldn't

them
there
was
no

from

to

i
missed
the
refreshing
and
luxurious
sense
induced
by
the
night
gown
of
being
undressed
emancipated
set
free
from
restraints
and
trammels
in

that
i
had

sense
of
being
abed
with
my
clothes
on
all
through
the
warm
half
of

coarse
surfaces
irritated
my
skin

made
it

came
in

fitful
flurries
of

were
such
as

the

and
all
through
the
cold
other
half
of
the
night
i
could
get
no
time
for
sleep
because
i
had
to
employ
it
all
in
stealing
blankets

blankets
are
of
no
value
at
such
a
time
the
higher
they
are
piled
the
more
effectively
they
cork
the
cold
in
and
keep
it
from
getting
out
the
result
is
that
your
legs
are
ice
and
you
know
how
you
will
feel
by
and
by
when
you
are
buried
in
a
sane
interval
i
discarded
the
pyjamas
and
led
a
rational
and
comfortable
life
thenceforth
out
in
the
country
in
india
the
day
begins
early
one
sees
a
plain
perfectly
flat
dust
colored
and
brick
yardy
stretching
limitlessly
away
on
every
side
in
the
dim
gray
light
striped
everywhere
with
hard
beaten
narrow
paths
the
vast
flatness
broken
at
wide
intervals
by
bunches
of
spectral
trees
that
mark
where
villages
are
and
along
all
the
paths
are
slender
women
and
the
black
forms
of
lanky
naked
men
moving
to
their
work
the
women
with
brass
water
jars
on
their
heads
the
men
carrying
hoes
the
man
is
not
entirely
naked
always
there
is
a
bit
of
white
rag
a
loin
cloth
it
amounts
to
a
bandage
and
is
a
white
accent
on
his
black
person
like
the
silver
band
around
the
middle
of
a
pipe
stem
sometimes
he
also
wears
a
fluffy
and
voluminous
white
turban
and
this
adds
a
second
accent
he
then
answers
properly
to
miss
gordon
cumming's
flash
light
picture
of
him
as
a
person
who
is
dressed
in
a
turban
and
a
pocket
handkerchief
all
day
long
one
has
this
monotony
of
dust
colored
dead
levels
and
scattering
bunches
of
trees
and
mud
villages
you
soon
realize
that
india
is
not
beautiful
still
there
is
an
enchantment
about
it
that
is
beguiling
and
which
does
not
pall
you
cannot
tell
just
what
it
is
that
makes
the
spell
perhaps
but
you
feel
it
and
confess
it
nevertheless
of
course
at
bottom
you
know
in
a
vague
way
that
it
is
history
it
is
that
that
affects
you
a
haunting
sense
of
the
myriads
of
human
lives
that
have
blossomed
and
withered
and
perished
here
repeating
and
repeating
and
repeating
century
after
century
and
age
after
age
the
barren
and
meaningless
process
it
is
this
sense
that
gives
to
this
forlorn
uncomely
land
power
to
speak
to
the
spirit
and
make
friends
with
it
to
speak
to
it
with
a
voice
bitter
with
satire
but
eloquent
with
melancholy
the
deserts
of
australia
and
the
ice
barrens
of
greenland
have
no
speech
for
they
have
no
venerable
history
with
nothing
to
tell
of
man
and
his
vanities
his
fleeting
glories
and
his
miseries
they
have
nothing
wherewith
to
spiritualize
their
ugliness
and
veil
it
with
a
charm
there
is
nothing
pretty
about
an
indian
village
a
mud
one
and
i
do
not
remember
that
we
saw
any
but
mud
ones
on
that
long
flight
to
allahabad
it
is
a
little
bunch
of
dirt
colored
mud
hovels
jammed
together
within
a
mud
wall
as
a
rule
the
rains
had
beaten
down
parts
of
some
of
the
houses
and
this
gave
the
village
the
aspect
of
a
mouldering
and
hoary
ruin
i
believe
the
cattle
and
the
vermin
live
inside
the
wall
for
i
saw
cattle
coming
out
and
cattle
going
in
and
whenever
i
saw
a
villager
he
was
scratching
this
last
is
only
circumstantial
evidence
but
i
think
it
has
value
the
village
has
a
battered
little
temple
or
two
big
enough
to
hold
an
idol
and
with
custom
enough
to
fat
up
a
priest
and
keep
him
comfortable
where
there
are
mohammedans
there
are
generally
a
few
sorry
tombs
outside
the
village
that
have
a
decayed
and
neglected
look
the
villages
interested
me
because
of
things
which
major
sleeman
says
about
them
in
his
books
particularly
what
he
says
about
the
division
of
labor
in
them
he
says
that
the
whole
face
of
india
is
parceled
out
into
estates
of
villages
that
nine
tenths
of
the
vast
population
of
the
land
consist
of
cultivators
of
the
soil
that
it
is
these
cultivators
who
inhabit
the
villages
that
there
are
certain
established
village
servants
mechanics
and
others
who
are
apparently
paid
a
wage
by
the
village
at
large
and
whose
callings
remain
in
certain
families
and
are
handed
down
from
father
to
son
like
an
estate
he
gives
a
list
of
these
established
servants
priest
blacksmith
carpenter
accountant
washerman
basketmaker
potter
watchman
barber
shoemaker
brazier
confectioner
weaver
dyer
etc
in
his
day
witches
abounded
and
it
was
not
thought
good
business
wisdom
for
a
man
to
marry
his
daughter
into
a
family
that
hadn't
a
witch
in
it
for
she
would
need
a
witch
on
the
premises
to
protect
her
children
from
the
evil
spells
which
would
certainly
be
cast
upon
them
by
the
witches
connected
with
the
neighboring
families
the
office
of
midwife
was
hereditary
in
the
family
of
the
basket
maker
it
belonged
to
his
wife
she
might
not
be
competent
but
the
office
was
hers
anyway
her
pay
was
not
high
25
cents
for
a
boy
and
half
as
much
for
a
girl
the
girl
was
not
desired
because
she
would
be
a
disastrous
expense
by
and
by
as
soon
as
she
should
be
old
enough
to
begin
to
wear
clothes
for
propriety's
sake
it
would
be
a
disgrace
to
the
family
if
she
were
not
married
and
to
marry
her
meant
financial
ruin
for
by
custom
the
father
must
spend
upon
feasting
and
wedding
display
everything
he
had
and
all
he
could
borrow
in
fact
reduce
himself
to
a
condition
of
poverty
which
he
might
never
more
recover
from
it
was
the
dread
of
this
prospective
ruin
which
made
the
killing
of
girl
babies
so
prevalent
in
india
in
the
old
days
before
england
laid
the
iron
hand
of
her
prohibitions
upon
the
piteous
slaughter
one
may
judge
of
how
prevalent
the
custom
was
by
one
of
sleeman's
casual
electrical
remarks
when
he
speaks
of
children
at
play
in
villages
where
girl
voices
were
never
heard!
the
wedding
display
folly
is
still
in
full
force
in
india
and
by
consequence
the
destruction
of
girl
babies
is
still
furtively
practiced
but
not
largely
because
of
the
vigilance
of
the
government
and
the
sternness
of
the
penalties
it
levies
in
some
parts
of
india
the
village
keeps
in
its
pay
three
other
servants
an
astrologer
to
tell
the
villager
when
he
may
plant
his
crop
or
make
a
journey
or
marry
a
wife
or
strangle
a
child
or
borrow
a
dog
or
climb
a
tree
or
catch
a
rat
or
swindle
a
neighbor
without
offending
the
alert
and
solicitous
heavens
and
what
his
dream
means
if
he
has
had
one
and
was
not
bright
enough
to
interpret
it
himself
by
the
details
of
his
dinner
the
two
other
established
servants
were
the
tiger
persuader
and
the
hailstorm
discourager
the
one
kept
away
the
tigers
if
he
could
and
collected
the
wages
anyway
and
the
other
kept
off
the
hailstorms
or
explained
why
he
failed
he
charged
the
same
for
explaining
a
failure
that
he
did
for
scoring
a
success
a
man
is
an
idiot
who
can't
earn
a
living
in
india
major
sleeman
reveals
the
fact
that
the
trade
union
and
the
boycott
are
antiquities
in
india
india
seems
to
have
originated
everything
the
sweeper
belongs
to
the
bottom
caste
he
is
the
lowest
of
the
low
all
other
castes
despise
him
and
scorn
his
office
but
that
does
not
trouble
him
his
caste
is
a
caste
and
that
is
sufficient
for
him
and
so
he
is
proud
of
it
not
ashamed
sleeman
says
it
is
perhaps
not
known
to
many
of
my
countrymen
even
in
india
that
in
every
town
and
city
in
the
country
the
right
of
sweeping
the
houses
and
streets
is
a
monopoly
and
is
supported
entirely
by
the
pride
of
castes
among
the
scavengers
who
are
all
of
the
lowest
class
the
right
of
sweeping
within
a
certain
range
is
recognized
by
the
caste
to
belong
to
a
certain
member
and
if
any
other
member
presumes
to
sweep
within
that
range
he
is
excommunicated
no
other
member
will
smoke
out
of
his
pipe
or
drink
out
of
his
jug
and
he
can
get
restored
to
caste
only
by
a
feast
to
the
whole
body
of
sweepers
if
any
housekeeper
within
a
particular
circle
happens
to
offend
the
sweeper
of
that
range
none
of
his
filth
will
be
removed
till
he
pacifies
him
because
no
other
sweeper
will
dare
to
touch
it
and
the
people
of
a
town
are
often
more
tyrannized
over
by
these
people
than
by
any
other
a
footnote
by
major
sleeman's
editor
mr
vincent
arthur
smith
says
that
in
our
day
this
tyranny
of
the
sweepers'
guild
is
one
of
the
many
difficulties
which
bar
the
progress
of
indian
sanitary
reform
think
of
this
the
sweepers
cannot
be
readily
coerced
because
no
hindoo
or
mussulman
would
do
their
work
to
save
his
life
nor
will
he
pollute
himself
by
beating
the
refractory
scavenger
they
certainly
do
seem
to
have
the
whip
hand
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
impregnable
position
the
vested
rights
described
in
the
text
are
so
fully
recognized
in
practice
that
they
are
frequently
the
subject
of
sale
or
mortgage
just
like
a
milk
route
or
like
a
london
crossing
sweepership
it
is
said
that
the
london
crossing
sweeper's
right
to
his
crossing
is
recognized
by
the
rest
of
the
guild
that
they
protect
him
in
its
possession
that
certain
choice
crossings
are
valuable
property
and
are
saleable
at
high
figures
i
have
noticed
that
the
man
who
sweeps
in
front
of
the
army
and
navy
stores
has
a
wealthy
south
african
aristocratic
style
about
him
and
when
he
is
off
his
guard
he
has
exactly
that
look
on
his
face
which
you
always
see
in
the
face
of
a
man
who
has
is
saving
up
his
daughter
to
marry
her
to
a
duke
it
appears
from
sleeman
that
in
india
the
occupation
of
elephant
driver
is
confined
to
mohammedans
i
wonder
why
that
is
the
water
carrier
'bheestie'
is
a
mohammedan
but
it
is
said
that
the
reason
of
that
is
that
the
hindoo's
religion
does
not
allow
him
to
touch
the
skin
of
dead
kine
and
that
is
what
the
water
sack
is
made
of
it
would
defile
him
and
it
doesn't
allow
him
to
eat
meat
the
animal
that
furnished
the
meat
was
murdered
and
to
take
any
creature's
life
is
a
sin
it
is
a
good
and
gentle
religion
but
inconvenient
a
great
indian
river
at
low
water
suggests
the
familiar
anatomical
picture
of
a
skinned
human
body
the
intricate
mesh
of
interwoven
muscles
and
tendons
to
stand
for
water
channels
and
the
archipelagoes
of
fat
and
flesh
inclosed
by
them
to
stand
for
the
sandbars
somewhere
on
this
journey
we
passed
such
a
river
and
on
a
later
journey
we
saw
in
the
sutlej
the
duplicate
of
that
river
curious
rivers
they
are
low
shores
a
dizzy
distance
apart
with
nothing
between
but
an
enormous
acreage
of
sand
flats
with
sluggish
little
veins
of
water
dribbling
around
amongst
them
saharas
of
sand
smallpox
pitted
with
footprints
punctured
in
belts
as
straight
as
the
equator
clear
from
the
one
shore
to
the
other
barring
the
channel
interruptions
a
dry
shod
ferry
you
see
long
railway
bridges
are
required
for
this
sort
of
rivers
and
india
has
them
you
approach
allahabad
by
a
very
long
one
it
was
now
carrying
us
across
the
bed
of
the
jumna
a
bed
which
did
not
seem
to
have
been
slept
in
for
one
while
or
more
it
wasn't
all
river
bed
most
of
it
was
overflow
ground
allahabad
means
city
of
god
i
get
this
from
the
books
from
a
printed
curiosity
a
letter
written
by
one
of
those
brave
and
confident
hindoo
strugglers
with
the
english
tongue
called
a
babu
i
got
a
more
compressed
translation
godville
it
is
perfectly
correct
but
that
is
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
it
we
arrived
in
the
forenoon
and
short
handed
for
satan
got
left
behind
somewhere
that
morning
and
did
not
overtake
us
until
after
nightfall
it
seemed
very
peaceful
without
him
the
world
seemed
asleep
and
dreaming
i
did
not
see
the
native
town
i
think
i
do
not
remember
why
for
an
incident
connects
it
with
the
great
mutiny
and
that
is
enough
to
make
any
place
interesting
but
i
saw
the
english
part
of
the
city
it
is
a
town
of
wide
avenues
and
noble
distances
and
is
comely
and
alluring
and
full
of
suggestions
of
comfort
and
leisure
and
of
the
serenity
which
a
good
conscience
buttressed
by
a
sufficient
bank
account
gives
the
bungalows
dwellings
stand
well
back
in
the
seclusion
and
privacy
of
large
enclosed
compounds
private
grounds
as
we
should
say
and
in
the
shade
and
shelter
of
trees
even
the
photographer
and
the
prosperous
merchant
ply
their
industries
in
the
elegant
reserve
of
big
compounds
and
the
citizens
drive
in
thereupon
their
business
occasions
and
not
in
cabs
no
in
the
indian
cities
cabs
are
for
the
drifting
stranger
all
the
white
citizens
have
private
carriages
and
each
carriage
has
a
flock
of
white
turbaned
black
footmen
and
drivers
all
over
it
the
vicinity
of
a
lecture
hall
looks
like
a
snowstorm
and
makes
the
lecturer
feel
like
an
opera
india
has
many
names
and
they
are
correctly
descriptive
it
is
the
land
of
contradictions
the
land
of
subtlety
and
superstition
the
land
of
wealth
and
poverty
the
land
of
splendor
and
desolation
the
land
of
plague
and
famine
the
land
of
the
thug
and
the
poisoner
and
of
the
meek
and
the
patient
the
land
of
the
suttee
the
land
of
the
unreinstatable
widow
the
land
where
all
life
is
holy
the
land
of
cremation
the
land
where
the
vulture
is
a
grave
and
a
monument
the
land
of
the
multitudinous
gods
and
if
signs
go
for
anything
it
is
the
land
of
the
private
carriage
in
bombay
the
forewoman
of
a
millinery
shop
came
to
the
hotel
in
her
private
carriage
to
take
the
measure
for
a
gown
not
for
me
but
for
another
she
had
come
out
to
india
to
make
a
temporary
stay
but
was
extending
it
indefinitely
indeed
she
was
purposing
to
end
her
days
there
in
london
she
said
her
work
had
been
hard
her
hours
long
for
economy's
sake
she
had
had
to
live
in
shabby
rooms
and
far
away
from
the
shop
watch
the
pennies
deny
herself
many
of
the
common
comforts
of
life
restrict
herself
in
effect
to
its
bare
necessities
eschew
cabs
travel
third
class
by
underground
train
to
and
from
her
work
swallowing
coal
smoke
and
cinders
all
the
way
and
sometimes
troubled
with
the
society
of
men
and
women
who
were
less
desirable
than
the
smoke
and
the
cinders
but
in
bombay
on
almost
any
kind
of
wages
she
could
live
in
comfort
and
keep
her
carriage
and
have
six
servants
in
place
of
the
woman
of
all
work
she
had
had
in
her
english
home
later
in
calcutta
i
found
that
the
standard
oil
clerks
had
small
one
horse
vehicles
and
did
no
walking
and
i
was
told
that
the
clerks
of
the
other
large
concerns
there
had
the
like
equipment
but
to
return
to
allahabad
i
was
up
at
dawn
the
next
morning
in
india
the
tourist's
servant
does
not
sleep
in
a
room
in
the
hotel
but
rolls
himself
up
head
and
ears
in
his
blanket
and
stretches
himself
on
the
veranda
across
the
front
of
his
master's
door
and
spends
the
night
there
i
don't
believe
anybody's
servant
occupies
a
room
apparently
the
bungalow
servants
sleep
on
the
veranda
it
is
roomy
and
goes
all
around
the
house
i
speak
of
menservants
i
saw
none
of
the
other
sex
i
think
there
are
none
except
child
nurses
i
was
up
at
dawn
and
walked
around
the
veranda
past
the
rows
of
sleepers
in
front
of
one
door
a
hindoo
servant
was
squatting
waiting
for
his
master
to
call
him
he
had
polished
the
yellow
shoes
and
placed
them
by
the
door
and
now
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
wait
it
was
freezing
cold
but
there
he
was
as
motionless
as
a
sculptured
image
and
as
patient
it
troubled
me
i
wanted
to
say
to
him
don't
crouch
there
like
that
and
freeze
nobody
requires
it
of
you
stir
around
and
get
warm
but
i
hadn't
the
words
i
thought
of
saying
'jeldy
jow'
but
i
couldn't
remember
what
it
meant
so
i
didn't
say
it
i
knew
another
phrase
but
it
wouldn't
come
to
my
mind
i
moved
on
purposing
to
dismiss
him
from
my
thoughts
but
his
bare
legs
and
bare
feet
kept
him
there
they
kept
drawing
me
back
from
the
sunny
side
to
a
point
whence
i
could
see
him
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
had
not
changed
his
attitude
in
the
least
degree
it
was
a
curious
and
impressive
exhibition
of
meekness
and
patience
or
fortitude
or
indifference
i
did
not
know
which
but
it
worried
me
and
it
was
spoiling
my
morning
in
fact
it
spoiled
two
hours
of
it
quite
thoroughly
i
quitted
this
vicinity
then
and
left
him
to
punish
himself
as
much
as
he
might
want
to
but
up
to
that
time
the
man
had
not
changed
his
attitude
a
hair
he
will
always
remain
with
me
i
suppose
his
figure
never
grows
vague
in
my
memory
whenever
i
read
of
indian
resignation
indian
patience
under
wrongs
hardships
and
misfortunes
he
comes
before
me
he
becomes
a
personification
and
stands
for
india
in
trouble
and
for
untold
ages
india
in
trouble
has
been
pursued
with
the
very
remark
which
i
was
going
to
utter
but
didn't
because
its
meaning
had
slipped
me
jeddy
jow!
come
shove
along!
why
it
was
the
very
thing
in
the
early
brightness
we
made
a
long
drive
out
to
the
fort
part
of
the
way
was
beautiful
it
led
under
stately
trees
and
through
groups
of
native
houses
and
by
the
usual
village
well
where
the
picturesque
gangs
are
always
flocking
to
and
fro
and
laughing
and
chattering
and
this
time
brawny
men
were
deluging
their
bronze
bodies
with
the
limpid
water
and
making
a
refreshing
and
enticing
show
of
it
enticing
for
the
sun
was
already
transacting
business
firing
india
up
for
the
day
there
was
plenty
of
this
early
bathing
going
on
for
it
was
getting
toward
breakfast
time
and
with
an
unpurified
body
the
hindoo
must
not
eat
then
we
struck
into
the
hot
plain
and
found
the
roads
crowded
with
pilgrims
of
both
sexes
for
one
of
the
great
religious
fairs
of
india
was
being
held
just
beyond
the
fort
at
the
junction
of
the
sacred
rivers
the
ganges
and
the
jumna
three
sacred
rivers
i
should
have
said
for
there
is
a
subterranean
one
nobody
has
seen
it
but
that
doesn't
signify
the
fact
that
it
is
there
is
enough
these
pilgrims
had
come
from
all
over
india
some
of
them
had
been
months
on
the
way
plodding
patiently
along
in
the
heat
and
dust
worn
poor
hungry
but
supported
and
sustained
by
an
unwavering
faith
and
belief
they
were
supremely
happy
and
content
now
their
full
and
sufficient
reward
was
at
hand
they
were
going
to
be
cleansed
from
every
vestige
of
sin
and
corruption
by
these
holy
waters
which
make
utterly
pure
whatsoever
thing
they
touch
even
the
dead
and
rotten
it
is
wonderful
the
power
of
a
faith
like
that
that
can
make
multitudes
upon
multitudes
of
the
old
and
weak
and
the
young
and
frail
enter
without
hesitation
or
complaint
upon
such
incredible
journeys
and
endure
the
resultant
miseries
without
repining
it
is
done
in
love
or
it
is
done
in
fear
i
do
not
know
which
it
is
no
matter
what
the
impulse
is
the
act
born
of
it
is
beyond
imagination
marvelous
to
our
kind
of
people
the
cold
whites
there
are
choice
great
natures
among
us
that
could
exhibit
the
equivalent
of
this
prodigious
self
sacrifice
but
the
rest
of
us
know
that
we
should
not
be
equal
to
anything
approaching
it
still
we
all
talk
self
sacrifice
and
this
makes
me
hope
that
we
are
large
enough
to
honor
it
in
the
hindoo
two
millions
of
natives
arrive
at
this
fair
every
year
how
many
start
and
die
on
the
road
from
age
and
fatigue
and
disease
and
scanty
nourishment
and
how
many
die
on
the
return
from
the
same
causes
no
one
knows
but
the
tale
is
great
one
may
say
enormous
every
twelfth
year
is
held
to
be
a
year
of
peculiar
grace
a
greatly
augmented
volume
of
pilgrims
results
then
the
twelfth
year
has
held
this
distinction
since
the
remotest
times
it
is
said
it
is
said
also
that
there
is
to
be
but
one
more
twelfth
year
for
the
ganges
after
that
that
holiest
of
all
sacred
rivers
will
cease
to
be
holy
and
will
be
abandoned
by
the
pilgrim
for
many
centuries
how
many
the
wise
men
have
not
stated
at
the
end
of
that
interval
it
will
become
holy
again
meantime
the
data
will
be
arranged
by
those
people
who
have
charge
of
all
such
matters
the
great
chief
brahmins
it
will
be
like
shutting
down
a
mint
at
a
first
glance
it
looks
most
unbrahminically
uncommercial
but
i
am
not
disturbed
being
soothed
and
tranquilized
by
their
reputation

at

time

something
on

public
which
will
show
that
he
was
not
financially
asleep
when
he
took
the
ganges
out
of
the
market
great
numbers
of
the
natives
along
the
roads
were
bringing
away
holy
water
from
the
rivers
they
would
carry
it
far
and
wide
in
india
and
sell
it

is

the
fort
is
a
huge
old
structure
and
has
had
a
large
experience
in
religions
in
its
great
court
stands
a
monolith
which
was
placed
there
more
than
2
000
years
ago
to
preach
budhism
by
its
pious
inscription
the
fort
was
built
three
centuries
ago
by
a
mohammedan
emperor
a
resanctification
of
the
place
in
the
interest
of
that
religion
there
is
a
hindoo
temple
too
with
subterranean
ramifications
stocked
with
shrines
and
idols
and
now
the
fort
belongs
to
the
english
it
contains
a
christian
church
insured
in
all
the
companies
from
the
lofty
ramparts
one
has
a
fine
view
of
the
sacred
rivers

join
at
that
point
the
pale

apparently
clean
and
clear
and
the
muddy
ganges
dull
yellow
and
not
clean
on
a
long
curved
spit
between
the
rivers
towns
of
tents
were
visible
with
a
multitude
of
fluttering
pennons
and
a
mighty
swarm
of
pilgrims
it
was
a
troublesome
place
to
get
down
to
and
not
a
quiet
place
when
you
arrived
but
it
was
interesting
there
was
a
world
of
activity
and
turmoil
and
noise
partly
religious
partly
commercial
for
the
mohammedans
were
there
to
curse
and
sell
and
the
hindoos
to
buy
and
pray
it
is
a
fair
as
well
as
a
religious
festival
crowds
were
bathing
praying
and
drinking
the
purifying
waters
and
many
sick
pilgrims
had
come
long
journeys
in
palanquins
to
be
healed
of
their
maladies
by
a
bath
or
if
that
might
not
be
then
to
die
on
the
blessed
banks
and
so
make
sure
of
heaven
there
were
fakeers
in
plenty
with
their
bodies
dusted
over
with
ashes
and
their
long
hair
caked
together
with
cow
dung
for
the
cow
is
holy
and
so
is
the
rest
of
it
so
holy
that
the
good
hindoo
peasant
frescoes
the
walls
of
his
hut
with
this
refuse
and
also
constructs
ornamental
figures
out
of
it
for
the
gracing
of
his
dirt
floor
there
were
seated
families
fearfully
and
wonderfully
painted
who
by
attitude
and
grouping
represented
the
families
of
certain
great
gods
there
was
a
holy
man
who
sat
naked
by
the
day
and
by
the
week
on
a
cluster
of
iron
spikes
and
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
and
another
holy
man
who
stood
all
day
holding
his
withered
arms
motionless
aloft
and
was
said
to
have
been
doing
it
for
years
all
of
these
performers
have
a
cloth
on
the
ground
beside
them
for
the
reception
of
contributions
and
even
the
poorest
of
the
people
give
a
trifle
and
hope
that
the
sacrifice
will
be
blessed
to
him
at
last
came
a
procession
of
naked
holy
people
marching
by
and
chanting
and

wrenched

wilson's
new
calendar
the
journey
to
benares
was
all
in
daylight
and
occupied
but
a
few
hours
it
was
admirably
dusty
the
dust
settled
upon
you
in
a
thick
ashy
layer
and
turned
you
into
a
fakeer
with
nothing
lacking
to
the
role
but
the
cow
manure
and
the
sense
of
holiness
there
was
a
change
of
cars
about
mid
afternoon
at
moghul
serai
if
that
was
the
name
and
a
wait
of
two
hours
there
for
the
benares
train
we
could
have
found
a
carriage
and
driven
to
the
sacred
city
but
we
should
have
lost
the
wait
in
other
countries
a
long
wait
at
a
station
is
a
dull
thing
and
tedious
but
one
has
no
right
to
have
that
feeling
in
india
you
have
the
monster
crowd
of
bejeweled
natives
the
stir
the
bustle
the
confusion
the
shifting
splendors
of
the
costumes
dear
me
the
delight
of
it
the
charm
of
it
are
beyond
speech
the
two
hour
wait
was
over
too
soon
among
other
satisfying
things
to
look
at
was
a
minor
native
prince
from
the
backwoods
somewhere
with
his
guard
of
honor
a
ragged
but
wonderfully
gaudy
gang
of
fifty
dark
barbarians
armed
with
rusty
flint
lock
muskets
the
general
show
came
so
near
to
exhausting
variety
that
one
would
have
said
that
no
addition
to
it
could
be
conspicuous
but
when
this
falstaff
and
his
motleys
marched
through
it
one
saw
that
that
seeming
impossibility
had
happened
we
got
away
by
and
by
and
soon
reached
the
outer
edge
of
benares
then
there
was
another
wait
but
as
usual
with
something
to
look
at
this
was
a
cluster
of
little
canvas
boxes
palanquins
a
canvas
box
is
not
much
of
a
sight
when
empty
but
when
there
is
a
lady
in
it
it
is
an
object
of
interest
these
boxes
were
grouped
apart
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
terrible
sun
during
the
three
quarters
of
an
hour
that
we
tarried
there
they
contained
zenana
ladies
they
had
to
sit
up
there
was
not
room
enough
to
stretch
out
they
probably
did
not
mind
it
they
are
used
to
the
close
captivity
of
the
dwellings
all
their
lives
when
they
go
a
journey
they
are
carried
to
the
train
in
these
boxes
in
the
train
they
have
to
be
secluded
from
inspection
many
people
pity
them
and
i
always
did
it
myself
and
never
charged
anything
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
compassion
is
valued
while
we
were
in
india
some
good
hearted
europeans
in
one
of
the
cities
proposed
to
restrict
a
large
park
to
the
use
of
zenana
ladies
so
that
they
could
go
there
and
in
assured
privacy
go
about
unveiled
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
and
air
as
they
had
never
enjoyed
them
before
the
good
intentions
back
of
the
proposition
were
recognized
and
sincere
thanks
returned
for
it
but
the
proposition
itself
met
with
a
prompt
declination
at
the
hands
of
those
who
were
authorized
to
speak
for
the
zenana
ladies
apparently
the
idea
was
shocking
to
the
ladies
indeed
it
was
quite
manifestly
shocking
was
that
proposition
the
equivalent
of
inviting
european
ladies
to
assemble
scantily
and
scandalously
clothed
in
the
seclusion
of
a
private
park
it
seemed
to
be
about
that
without
doubt
modesty
is
nothing
less
than
a
holy
feeling
and
without
doubt
the
person
whose
rule
of
modesty
has
been
transgressed
feels
the
same
sort
of
wound
that
he
would
feel
if
something
made
holy
to
him
by
his
religion
had
suffered
a
desecration
i
say
rule
of
modesty
because
there
are
about
a
million
rules
in
the
world
and
this
makes
a
million
standards
to
be
looked
out
for
major
sleeman
mentions
the
case
of
some
high
caste
veiled
ladies
who
were
profoundly
scandalized
when
some
english
young
ladies
passed
by
with
faces
bare
to
the
world
so
scandalized
that
they
spoke
out
with
strong
indignation
and
wondered
that
people
could
be
so
shameless
as
to
expose
their
persons
like
that
and
yet
the
legs
of
the
objectors
were
naked
to
mid
thigh
both
parties
were
clean
minded
and
irreproachably
modest
while
abiding
by
their
separate
rules
but
they
couldn't
have
traded
rules
for
a
change
without
suffering
considerable
discomfort
all
human
rules
are
more
or
less
idiotic
i
suppose
it
is
best
so
no
doubt
the
way
it
is
now
the
asylums
can
hold
the
sane
people
but
if
we
tried
to
shut
up
the
insane
we
should
run
out
of
building
materials
you
have
a
long
drive
through
the
outskirts
of
benares
before
you
get
to
the
hotel
and
all
the
aspects
are
melancholy
it
is
a
vision
of
dusty
sterility
decaying
temples
crumbling
tombs
broken
mud
walls
shabby
huts
the
whole
region
seems
to
ache
with
age
and
penury
it
must
take
ten
thousand
years
of
want
to
produce
such
an
aspect
we
were
still
outside
of
the
great
native
city
when
we
reached
the
hotel
it
was
a
quiet
and
homelike
house
inviting
and
manifestly
comfortable
but
we
liked
its
annex
better
and
went
thither
it
was
a
mile
away
perhaps
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
large
compound
and
was
built
bungalow
fashion
everything
on
the
ground
floor
and
a
veranda
all
around
they
have
doors
in
india
but
i
don't
know
why
they
don't
fasten
and
they
stand
open
as
a
rule
with
a
curtain
hanging
in
the
doorspace
to
keep
out
the
glare
of
the
sun
still
there
is
plenty
of
privacy
for
no
white
person
will
come
in
without
notice
of
course
the
native
men
servants
will
but
they
don't
seem
to
count
they
glide
in
barefoot
and
noiseless
and
are
in
the
midst
before
one
knows
it
at
first
this
is
a
shock
and
sometimes
it
is
an
embarrassment
but
one
has
to
get
used
to
it
and
does
there
was
one
tree
in
the
compound
and
a
monkey
lived
in
it
at
first
i
was
strongly
interested
in
the
tree
for
i
was
told
that
it
was
the
renowned
peepul
the
tree
in
whose
shadow
you
cannot
tell
a
lie
this
one
failed
to
stand
the
test
and
i
went
away
from
it
disappointed
there
was
a
softly
creaking
well
close
by
and
a
couple
of
oxen
drew
water
from
it
by
the
hour
superintended
by
two
natives
dressed
in
the
usual
turban
and
pocket
handkerchief
the
tree
and
the
well
were
the
only
scenery
and
so
the
compound
was
a
soothing
and
lonesome
and
satisfying
place
and
very
restful
after
so
many
activities
there
was
nobody
in
our
bungalow
but
ourselves
the
other
guests
were
in
the
next
one
where
the
table
d'hote
was
furnished
a
body
could
not
be
more
pleasantly
situated
each
room
had
the
customary
bath
attached
a
room
ten
or
twelve
feet
square
with
a
roomy
stone
paved
pit
in
it
and
abundance
of
water
one
could
not
easily
improve
upon
this
arrangement
except
by
furnishing
it
with
cold
water
and
excluding
the
hot
in
deference
to
the
fervency
of
the
climate
but
that
is
forbidden
it
would
damage
the
bather's
health
the
stranger
is
warned
against
taking
cold
baths
in
india
but
even
the
most
intelligent
strangers
are
fools
and
they
do
not
obey
and
so
they
presently
get
laid
up
i
was
the
most
intelligent
fool
that
passed
through
that
year
but
i
am
still
more
intelligent
now
now
that
it
is
too
late
i
wonder
if
the
'dorian'
if
that
is
the
name
of
it
is
another
superstition
like
the
peepul
tree
there
was
a
great
abundance
and
variety
of
tropical
fruits
but
the
dorian
was
never
in
evidence
it
was
never
the
season
for
the
dorian
it
was
always
going
to
arrive
from
burma
sometime
or
other
but
it
never
did
by
all
accounts
it
was
a
most
strange
fruit
and
incomparably
delicious
to
the
taste
but
not
to
the
smell
its
rind
was
said
to
exude
a
stench
of
so
atrocious
a
nature
that
when
a
dorian
was
in
the
room
even
the
presence
of
a
polecat
was
a
refreshment
we
found
many
who
had
eaten
the
dorian
and
they
all
spoke
of
it
with
a
sort
of
rapture
they
said
that
if
you
could
hold
your
nose
until
the
fruit
was
in
your
mouth
a
sacred
joy
would
suffuse
you
from
head
to
foot
that
would
make
you
oblivious
to
the
smell
of
the
rind
but
that
if
your
grip
slipped
and
you
caught
the
smell
of
the
rind
before
the
fruit
was
in
your
mouth
you
would
faint
there
is
a
fortune
in
that
rind
some
day
somebody
will
import
it
into
europe
and
sell
it
for
cheese
benares
was
not
a
disappointment
it
justified
its
reputation
as
a
curiosity
it
is
on
high
ground
and
overhangs
a
grand
curve
of
the
ganges
it
is
a
vast
mass
of
building
compactly
crusting
a
hill
and
is
cloven
in
all
directions
by
an
intricate
confusion
of
cracks
which
stand
for
streets
tall
slim
minarets
and
beflagged
temple
spires
rise
out
of
it
and
give
it
picturesqueness
viewed
from
the
river
the
city
is
as
busy
as
an
ant
hill
and
the
hurly
burly
of
human
life
swarming
along
the
web
of
narrow
streets
reminds
one
of
the
ants
the
sacred
cow
swarms
along
too
and
goes
whither
she
pleases
and
takes
toll
of
the
grain
shops
and
is
very
much
in
the
way
and
is
a
good
deal
of
a
nuisance
since
she
must
not
be
molested
benares
is
older
than
history
older
than
tradition
older
even
than
legend
and
looks
twice
as
old
as
all
of
them
put
together
from
a
hindoo
statement
quoted
in
rev
mr
parker's
compact
and
lucid
guide
to
benares
i
find
that
the
site
of
the
town
was
the
beginning
place
of
the
creation
it
was
merely
an
upright
lingam
at
first
no
larger
than
a
stove
pipe
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
shoreless
ocean
this
was
the
work
of
the
god
vishnu
later
he
spread
the
lingam
out
till
its
surface
was
ten
miles
across
still
it
was
not
large
enough
for
the
business
therefore
he
presently
built
the
globe
around
it
benares
is
thus
the
center
of
the
earth
this
is
considered
an
advantage
it
has
had
a
tumultuous
history
both
materially
and
spiritually
it
started
brahminically
many
ages
ago
then
by
and
by
buddha
came
in
recent
times
2
500
years
ago
and
after
that
it
was
buddhist
during
many
centuries
twelve
perhaps
but
the
brahmins
got
the
upper
hand
again
then
and
have
held
it
ever
since
it
is
unspeakably
sacred
in
hindoo
eyes
and
is
as
unsanitary
as
it
is
sacred
and
smells
like
the
rind
of
the
dorian
it
is
the
headquarters
of
the
brahmin
faith
and
one
eighth
of
the
population
are
priests
of
that
church
but
it
is
not
an
overstock
for
they
have
all
india
as
a
prey
all
india
flocks
thither
on
pilgrimage
and
pours
its
savings
into
the
pockets
of
the
priests
in
a
generous
stream
which
never
fails
a
priest
with
a
good
stand
on
the
shore
of
the
ganges
is
much
better
off
than
the
sweeper
of
the
best
crossing
in
london
a
good
stand
is
worth
a
world
of
money
the
holy
proprietor
of
it
sits
under
his
grand
spectacular
umbrella
and
blesses
people
all
his
life
and
collects
his
commission
and
grows
fat
and
rich
and
the
stand
passes
from
father
to
son
down
and
down
and
down
through
the
ages
and
remains
a
permanent
and
lucrative
estate
in
the
family
as
mr
parker
suggests
it
can
become
a
subject
of
dispute
at
one
time
or
another
and
then
the
matter
will
be
settled
not
by
prayer
and
fasting
and
consultations
with
vishnu
but
by
the
intervention
of
a
much
more
puissant
power
an
english
court
in
bombay
i
was
told
by
an
american
missionary
that
in
india
there
are
640
protestant
missionaries
at
work
at
first
it
seemed
an
immense
force
but
of
course
that
was
a
thoughtless
idea
one
missionary
to
500
000
natives
no
that
is
not
a
force
it
is
the
reverse
of
it
640
marching
against
an
intrenched
camp
of
300
000
000
the
odds
are
too
great
a
force
of
640
in
benares
alone
would
have
its
hands
over
full
with
8
000
brahmin
priests
for
adversary
missionaries
need
to
be
well
equipped
with
hope
and
confidence
and
this
equipment
they
seem
to
have
always
had
in
all
parts
of
the
world
mr
parker
has
it
it
enables
him
to
get
a
favorable
outlook
out
of
statistics
which
might
add
up
differently
with
other
mathematicians
for
instance
during
the
past
few
years
competent
observers
declare
that
the
number
of
pilgrims
to
benares
has
increased
and
then
he
adds
up
this
fact
and
gets
this
conclusion
but
the
revival
if
so
it
may
be
called
has
in
it
the
marks
of
death
it
is
a
spasmodic
struggle
before
dissolution
in
this
world
we
have
seen
the
roman
catholic
power
dying
upon
these
same
terms
for
many
centuries
many
a
time
we
have
gotten
all
ready
for
the
funeral
and
found
it
postponed
again
on
account
of
the
weather
or
something
taught
by
experience
we
ought
not
to
put
on
our
things
for
this
brahminical
one
till
we
see
the
procession
move
apparently
one
of
the
most
uncertain
things
in
the
world
is
the
funeral
of
a
religion
i
should
have
been
glad
to
acquire
some
sort
of
idea
of
hindoo
theology
but
the
difficulties
were
too
great
the
matter
was
too
intricate
even
the
mere
a
b
c
of
it
is
baffling
there
is
a
trinity
brahma
shiva
and
vishnu
independent
powers
apparently
though
one
cannot
feel
quite
sure
of
that
because
in
one
of
the
temples
there
is
an
image
where
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
concentrate
the
three
in
one
person
the
three
have
other
names
and
plenty
of
them
and
this
makes
confusion
in
one's
mind
the
three
have
wives
and
the
wives
have
several
names
and
this
increases
the
confusion
there
are
children
the
children
have
many
names
and
thus
the
confusion
goes
on
and
on
it
is
not
worth
while
to
try
to
get
any
grip
upon
the
cloud
of
minor
gods
there
are
too
many
of
them
it
is
even
a
justifiable
economy
to
leave
brahma
the
chiefest
god
of
all
out
of
your
studies
for
he
seems
to
cut
no
great
figure
in
india
the
vast
bulk
of
the
national
worship
is
lavished
upon
shiva
and
vishnu
and
their
families
shiva's
symbol
the
lingam
with
which
vishnu
began
the
creation
is
worshiped
by
everybody
apparently
it
is
the
commonest
object
in
benares
it
is
on
view
everywhere
it
is
garlanded
with
flowers
offerings
are
made
to
it
it
suffers
no
neglect
commonly
it
is
an
upright
stone
shaped
like
a
thimble
sometimes
like
an
elongated
thimble
this
priapus
worship
then
is
older
than
history
mr
parker
says
that
the
lingams
in
benares
outnumber
the
inhabitants
in
benares
there
are
many
mohammedan
mosques
there
are
hindoo
temples
without
number
these
quaintly
shaped
and
elaborately
sculptured
little
stone
jugs
crowd
all
the
lanes
the
ganges
itself
and
every
individual
drop
of
water
in
it
are
temples
religion
then
is
the
business
of
benares
just
as
gold
production
is
the
business
of
johannesburg
other
industries
count
for
nothing
as
compared
with
the
vast
and
all
absorbing
rush
and
drive
and
boom
of
the
town's
specialty
benares
is
the
sacredest
of
sacred
cities
the
moment
you
step
across
the
sharply
defined
line
which
separates
it
from
the
rest
of
the
globe
you
stand
upon
ineffably
and
unspeakably
holy
ground
mr
parker
says
it
is
impossible
to
convey
any
adequate
idea
of
the
intense
feelings
of
veneration
and
affection
with
which
the
pious
hindoo
regards
'holy
kashi'
benares
and
then
he
gives
you
this
vivid
and
moving
picture
let
a
hindoo
regiment
be
marched
through
the
district
and
as
soon
as
they
cross
the
line
and
enter
the
limits
of
the
holy
place
they
rend
the
air
with
cries
of
'kashi
ji
ki
jai
jai
jai!
holy
kashi!
hail
to
thee!
hail!
hail!
hail
'
the
weary
pilgrim
scarcely
able
to
stand
with
age
and
weakness
blinded
by
the
dust
and
heat
and
almost
dead
with
fatigue
crawls
out
of
the
oven
like
railway
carriage
and
as
soon
as
his
feet
touch
the
ground
he
lifts
up
his
withered
hands
and
utters
the
same
pious
exclamation
let
a
european
in
some
distant
city
in
casual
talk
in
the
bazar
mention
the
fact
that
he
has
lived
at
benares
and
at
once
voices
will
be
raised
to
call
down
blessings
on
his
head
for
a
dweller
in
benares
is
of
all
men
most
blessed
it
makes
our
own
religious
enthusiasm
seem
pale
and
cold
inasmuch
as
the
life
of
religion
is
in
the
heart
not
the
head
mr
parker's
touching
picture
seems
to
promise
a
sort
of
indefinite
postponement
of
that
funeral
chapter
li
let
me
make
the
superstitions
of
a
nation
and
i
care
not
who
makes
its
laws
or
its
songs
either
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
yes
the
city
of
benares
is
in
effect
just
a
big
church
a
religious
hive
whose
every
cell
is
a
temple
a
shrine
or
a
mosque
and
whose
every
conceivable
earthly
and
heavenly
good
is
procurable
under
one
roof
so
to
speak
a
sort
of
army
and
navy
stores
theologically
stocked
i
will
make
out
a
little
itinerary
for
the
pilgrim
then
you
will
see
how
handy
the
system
is
how
convenient
how
comprehensive
if
you
go
to
benares
with
a
serious
desire
to
spiritually
benefit
yourself
you
will
find
it
valuable
i
got
some
of
the
facts
from
conversations
with
the
rev
mr
parker
and
the
others
from
his
guide
to
benares
they
are
therefore
trustworthy
1
purification
at
sunrise
you
must
go
down
to
the
ganges
and
bathe
pray
and
drink
some
of
the
water
this
is
for
your
general
purification
2
protection
against
hunger
next
you
must
fortify
yourself
against
the
sorrowful
earthly
ill
just
named
this
you
will
do
by
worshiping
for
a
moment
in
the
cow
temple
by
the
door
of
it
you
will
find
an
image
of
ganesh
son
of
shiva
it
has
the
head
of
an
elephant
on
a
human
body
its
face
and
hands
are
of
silver
you
will
worship
it
a
little
and
pass
on
into
a
covered
veranda
where
you
will
find
devotees
reciting
from
the
sacred
books
with
the
help
of
instructors
in
this
place
are
groups
of
rude
and
dismal
idols
you
may
contribute
something
for
their
support
then
pass
into
the
temple
a
grim
and
stenchy
place
for
it
is
populous
with
sacred
cows
and
with
beggars
you
will
give
something
to
the
beggars
and
reverently
kiss
the
tails
of
such
cows
as
pass
along
for
these
cows
are
peculiarly
holy
and
this
act
of
worship
will
secure
you
from
hunger
for
the
day
3
the
poor
man's
friend
you
will
next
worship
this
god
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
a
stone
cistern
in
the
temple
of
dalbhyeswar
under
the
shade
of
a
noble
peepul
tree
on
the
bluff
overlooking
the
ganges
so
you
must
go
back
to
the
river
the
poor
man's
friend
is
the
god
of
material
prosperity
in
general
and
the
god
of
the
rain
in
particular
you
will
secure
material
prosperity
or
both
by
worshiping
him
he
is
shiva
under
a
new
alias
and
he
abides
in
the
bottom
of
that
cistern
in
the
form
of
a
stone
lingam
you
pour
ganges
water
over
him
and
in
return
for
this
homage
you
get
the
promised
benefits
if
there
is
any
delay
about
the
rain
you
must
pour
water
in
until
the
cistern
is
full
the
rain
will
then
be
sure
to
come
4
fever
at
the
kedar
ghat
you
will
find
a
long
flight
of
stone
steps
leading
down
to
the
river
half
way
down
is
a
tank
filled
with
sewage
drink
as
much
of
it
as
you
want
it
is
for
fever
5
smallpox
go
straight
from
there
to
the
central
ghat
at
its
upstream
end
you
will
find
a
small
whitewashed
building
which
is
a
temple
sacred
to
sitala
goddess
of
smallpox
her
under
study
is
there
a
rude
human
figure
behind
a
brass
screen
you
will
worship
this
for
reasons
to
be
furnished
presently
6
the
well
of
fate
for
certain
reasons
you
will
next
go
and
do
homage
at
this
well
you
will
find
it
in
the
dandpan
temple
in
the
city
the
sunlight
falls
into
it
from
a
square
hole
in
the
masonry
above
you
will
approach
it
with
awe
for
your
life
is
now
at
stake
you
will
bend
over
and
look
if
the
fates
are
propitious
you
will
see
your
face
pictured
in
the
water
far
down
in
the
well
if
matters
have
been
otherwise
ordered
a
sudden
cloud
will
mask
the
sun
and
you
will
see
nothing
this
means
that
you
have
not
six
months
to
live
if
you
are
already
at
the
point
of
death
your
circumstances
are
now
serious
there
is
no
time
to
lose
let
this
world
go
arrange
for
the
next
one
handily
situated
at
your
very
elbow
is
opportunity
for
this
you
turn
and
worship
the
image
of
maha
kal
the
great
fate
and
happiness
in
the
life
to
come
is
secured
if
there
is
breath
in
your
body
yet
you
should
now
make
an
effort
to
get
a
further
lease
of
the
present
life
you
have
a
chance
there
is
a
chance
for
everything
in
this
admirably
stocked
and
wonderfully
systemized
spiritual
and
temporal
army
and
navy
store
you
must
get
yourself
carried
to
the
7
well
of
long
life
this
is
within
the
precincts
of
the
mouldering
and
venerable
briddhkal
temple
which
is
one
of
the
oldest
in
benares
you
pass
in
by
a
stone
image
of
the
monkey
god
hanuman
and
there
among
the
ruined
courtyards
you
will
find
a
shallow
pool
of
stagnant
sewage
it
smells
like
the
best
limburger
cheese
and
is
filthy
with
the
washings
of
rotting
lepers
but
that
is
nothing
bathe
in
it
bathe
in
it
gratefully
and
worshipfully
for
this
is
the
fountain
of
youth
these
are
the
waters
of
long
life
your
gray
hairs
will
disappear
and
with
them
your
wrinkles
and
your
rheumatism
the
burdens
of
care
and
the
weariness
of
age
and
you
will
come
out
young
fresh
elastic
and
full
of
eagerness
for
the
new
race
of
life
now
will
come
flooding
upon
you
the
manifold
desires
that
haunt
the
dear
dreams
of
the
morning
of
life
you
will
go
whither
you
will
find
8
fulfillment
of
desire
to
wit
to
the
kameshwar
temple
sacred
to
shiva
as
the
lord
of
desires
arrange
for
yours
there
and
if
you
like
to
look
at
idols
among
the
pack
and
jam
of
temples
there
you
will
find
enough
to
stock
a
museum
you
will
begin
to
commit
sins
now
with
a
fresh
new
vivacity
therefore
it
will
be
well
to
go
frequently
to
a
place
where
you
can
get
9
temporary
cleansing
from
sin
to
wit
to
the
well
of
the
earring
you
must
approach
this
with
the
profoundest
reverence
for
it
is
unutterably
sacred
it
is
indeed
the
most
sacred
place
in
benares
the
very
holy
of
holies
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
it
is
a
railed
tank
with
stone
stairways
leading
down
to
the
water
the
water
is
not
clean
of
course
it
could
not
be
for
people
are
always
bathing
in
it
as
long
as
you
choose
to
stand
and
look
you
will
see
the
files
of
sinners
descending
and
ascending
descending
soiled
with
sin
ascending
purged
from
it
the
liar
the
thief
the
murderer
and
the
adulterer
may
here
wash
and
be
clean
says
the
rev
mr
parker
in
his
book
very
well
i
know
mr
parker
and
i
believe
it
but
if
anybody
else
had
said
it
i
should
consider
him
a
person
who
had
better
go
down
in
the
tank
and
take
another
wash
the
god
vishnu
dug
this
tank
he
had
nothing
to
dig
with
but
his
discus
i
do
not
know
what
a
discus
is
but
i
know
it
is
a
poor
thing
to
dig
tanks
with
because
by
the
time
this
one
was
finished
it
was
full
of
sweat
vishnu's
sweat
he
constructed
the
site
that
benares
stands
on
and
afterward
built
the
globe
around
it
and
thought
nothing
of
it
yet
sweated
like
that
over
a
little
thing
like
this
tank
one
of
these
statements
is
doubtful
i
do
not
know
which
one
it
is
but
i
think
it
difficult
not
to
believe
that
a
god
who
could
build
a
world
around
benares
would
not
be
intelligent
enough
to
build
it
around
the
tank
too
and
not
have
to
dig
it
youth
long
life
temporary
purification
from
sin
salvation
through
propitiation
of
the
great
fate
these
are
all
good
but
you
must
do
something
more
you
must
10
make
salvation
sure
there
are
several
ways
to
get
drowned
in
the
ganges
is
one
but
that
is
not
pleasant
to
die
within
the
limits
of
benares
is
another
but
that
is
a
risky
one
because
you
might
be
out
of
town
when
your
time
came
the
best
one
of
all
is
the
pilgrimage
around
the
city
you
must
walk
also
you
must
go
barefoot
the
tramp
is
forty
four
miles
for
the
road
winds
out
into
the
country
a
piece
and
you
will
be
marching
five
or
six
days
but
you
will
have
plenty
of
company
you
will
move
with
throngs
and
hosts
of
happy
pilgrims
whose
radiant
costumes
will
make
the
spectacle
beautiful
and
whose
glad
songs
and
holy
pans
of
triumph
will
banish
your
fatigues
and
cheer
your
spirit
and
at
intervals
there
will
be
temples
where
you
may
sleep
and
be
refreshed
with
food
the
pilgrimage
completed
you
have
purchased
salvation
and
paid
for
it
but
you
may
not
get
it
unless
you
11
get
your
redemption
recorded
you
can
get
this
done
at
the
sakhi
binayak
temple
and
it
is
best
to
do
it
for
otherwise
you
might
not
be
able
to
prove
that
you
had
made
the
pilgrimage
in
case
the
matter
should
some
day
come
to
be
disputed
that
temple
is
in
a
lane
back
of
the
cow
temple
over
the
door
is
a
red
image
of
ganesh
of
the
elephant
head
son
and
heir
of
shiva
and
prince
of
wales
to
the
theological
monarchy
so
to
speak
within
is
a
god
whose
office
it
is
to
record
your
pilgrimage
and
be
responsible
for
you
you
will
not
see
him
but
you
will
see
a
brahmin
who
will
attend
to
the
matter
and
take
the
money
if
he
should
forget
to
collect
the
money
you
can
remind
him
he
knows
that
your
salvation
is
now
secure
but
of
course
you
would
like
to
know
it
yourself
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
go
and
pray
and
pay
at
the
12
well
of
the
knowledge
of
salvation
it
is
close
to
the
golden
temple
there
you
will
see
sculptured
out
of
a
single
piece
of
black
marble
a
bull
which
is
much
larger
than
any
living
bull
you
have
ever
seen
and
yet
is
not
a
good
likeness
after
all
and
there
also
you
will
see
a
very
uncommon
thing
an
image
of
shiva
you
have
seen
his
lingam
fifty
thousand
times
already
but
this
is
shiva
himself
and
said
to
be
a
good
likeness
it
has
three
eyes
he
is
the
only
god
in
the
firm
that
has
three
the
well
is
covered
by
a
fine
canopy
of
stone
supported
by
forty
pillars
and
around
it
you
will
find
what
you
have
already
seen
at
almost
every
shrine
you
have
visited
in
benares
a
mob
of
devout
and
eager
pilgrims
the
sacred
water
is
being
ladled
out
to
them
with
it
comes
to
them
the
knowledge
clear
thrilling
absolute
that
they
are
saved
and
you
can
see
by
their
faces
that
there
is
one
happiness
in
this
world
which
is
supreme
and
to
which
no
other
joy
is
comparable
you
receive
your
water
you
make
your
deposit
and
now
what
more
would
you
have
gold
diamonds
power
fame
all
in
a
single
moment
these
things
have
withered
to
dirt
dust
ashes
the
world
has
nothing
to
give
you
now
for
you
it
is
bankrupt
i
do
not
claim
that
the
pilgrims
do
their
acts
of
worship
in
the
order
and
sequence
above
charted
out
in
this
itinerary
of
mine
but
i
think
logic
suggests
that
they
ought
to
do
so
instead
of
a
helter
skelter
worship
we
then
have
a
definite
starting
place
and
a
march
which
carries
the
pilgrim
steadily
forward
by
reasoned
and
logical
progression
to
a
definite
goal
thus
his
ganges
bath
in
the
early
morning
gives
him
an
appetite
he
kisses
the
cow
tails
and
that
removes
it
it
is
now
business
hours
and
longings
for
material
prosperity
rise
in
his
mind
and
be
goes
and
pours
water
over
shiva's
symbol
this
insures
the
prosperity
but
also
brings
on
a
rain
which
gives
him
a
fever
then
he
drinks
the
sewage
at
the
kedar
ghat
to
cure
the
fever
it
cures
the
fever
but
gives
him
the
smallpox
he
wishes
to
know
how
it
is
going
to
turn
out
he
goes
to
the
dandpan
temple
and
looks
down
the
well
a
clouded
sun
shows
him
that
death
is
near
logically
his
best
course
for
the
present
since
he
cannot
tell
at
what
moment
he
may
die
is
to
secure
a
happy
hereafter
this
he
does
through
the
agency
of
the
great
fate
he
is
safe
now
for
heaven
his
next
move
will
naturally
be
to
keep
out
of
it
as
long
as
he
can
therefore
he
goes
to
the
briddhkal
temple
and
secures
youth
and
long
life
by
bathing
in
a
puddle
of
leper
pus
which
would
kill
a
microbe
logically
youth
has
re
equipped
him
for
sin
and
with
the
disposition
to
commit
it
he
will
naturally
go
to
the
fane
which
is
consecrated
to
the
fulfillment
of
desires
and
make
arrangements
logically
he
will
now
go
to
the
well
of
the
earring
from
time
to
time
to
unload
and
freshen
up
for
further
banned
enjoyments
but
first
and
last
and
all
the
time
he
is
human
and
therefore
in
his
reflective
intervals
he
will
always
be
speculating
in
futures
he
will
make
the
great
pilgrimage
around
the
city
and
so
make
his
salvation
absolutely
sure
he
will
also
have
record
made
of
it
so
that
it
may
remain
absolutely
sure
and
not
be
forgotten
or
repudiated
in
the
confusion
of
the
final
settlement
logically
also
he
will
wish
to
have
satisfying
and
tranquilizing
personal
knowledge
that
that
salvation
is
secure
therefore
he
goes
to
the
well
of
the
knowledge
of
salvation
adds
that
completing
detail
and
then
goes
about
his
affairs
serene
and
content
serene
and
content
for
he
is
now
royally
endowed
with
an
advantage
which
no
religion
in
this
world
could
give
him
but
his
own
for
henceforth
he
may
commit
as
many
million
sins
as
he
wants
to
and
nothing
can
come
of
it
thus
the
system
properly
and
logically
ordered
is
neat
compact
clearly
defined
and
covers
the
whole
ground
i
desire
to
recommend
it
to
such
as
find
the
other
systems
too
difficult
exacting
and
irksome
for
the
uses
of
this
fretful
brief
life
of
ours
however
let
me
not
deceive
any
one
my
itinerary
lacks
a
detail
i
must
put
it
in
the
truth
is
that
after
the
pilgrim
has
faithfully
followed
the
requirements
of
the
itinerary
through
to
the
end
and
has
secured
his
salvation
and
also
the
personal
knowledge
of
that
fact
there
is
still
an
accident
possible
to
him
which
can
annul
the
whole
thing
if
he
should
ever
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
ganges
and
get
caught
out
and
die
there
he
would
at
once
come
to
life
again
in
the
form
of
an
ass
think
of
that
after
all
this
trouble
and
expense
you
see
how
capricious
and
uncertain
salvation
is
there
the
hindoo
has
a
childish
and
unreasoning
aversion
to
being
turned
into
an
ass
it
is
hard
to
tell
why
one
could
properly
expect
an
ass
to
have
an
aversion
to
being
turned
into
a
hindoo
one
could
understand
that
he
could
lose
dignity
by
it
also
self
respect
and
nine
tenths
of
his
intelligence
but
the
hindoo
changed
into
an
ass
wouldn't
lose
anything
unless
you
count
his
religion
and
he
would
gain
much
release
from
his
slavery
to
two
million
gods
and
twenty
million
priests
fakeers
holy
mendicants
and
other
sacred
bacilli
he
would
escape
the
hindoo
hell
he
would
also
escape
the
hindoo
heaven
these
are
advantages
which
the
hindoo
ought
to
consider
then
he
would
go
over
and
die
on
the
other
side
benares
is
a
religious
vesuvius
in
its
bowels
the
theological
forces
have
been
heaving
and
tossing
rumbling
thundering
and
quaking
boiling
and
weltering
and
flaming
and
smoking
for
ages
but
a
little
group
of
missionaries
have
taken
post
at
its
base
and
they
have
hopes
there
are
the
baptist
missionary
society
the
church
missionary
society
the
london
missionary
society
the
wesleyan
missionary
society
and
the
zenana
bible
and
medical
mission
they
have
schools
and
the
principal
work
seems
to
be
among
the
children
and
no
doubt
that
part
of
the
work
prospers
best
for
grown
people
everywhere
are
always
likely
to
cling
to
the
religion
they
were
brought
up
in
chapter
lii
wrinkles
should
merely
indicate
where
smiles
have
been
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
in
one
of
those
benares
temples
we
saw
a
devotee
working
for
salvation
in
a
curious
way
he
had
a
huge
wad
of
clay
beside
him
and
was
making
it
up
into
little
wee
gods
no
bigger
than
carpet
tacks
he
stuck
a
grain
of
rice
into
each
to
represent
the
lingam
i
think
he
turned
them
out
nimbly
for
he
had
had
long
practice
and
had
acquired
great
facility
every
day
he
made
2
000
gods
then
threw
them
into
the
holy
ganges
this
act
of
homage
brought
him
the
profound
homage
of
the
pious
also
their
coppers
he
had
a
sure
living
here
and
was
earning
a
high
place
in
the
hereafter
the
ganges
front
is
the
supreme
show
place
of
benares
its
tall
bluffs
are
solidly
caked
from
water
to
summit
along
a
stretch
of
three
miles
with
a
splendid
jumble
of
massive
and
picturesque
masonry
a
bewildering
and
beautiful
confusion
of
stone
platforms
temples
stair
flights
rich
and
stately
palaces
nowhere
a
break
nowhere
a
glimpse
of
the
bluff
itself
all
the
long
face
of
it
is
compactly
walled
from
sight
by
this
crammed
perspective
of
platforms
soaring
stairways
sculptured
temples
majestic
palaces
softening
away
into
the
distances
and
there
is
movement
motion
human
life
everywhere
and
brilliantly
costumed
streaming
in
rainbows
up
and
down
the
lofty
stairways
and
massed
in
metaphorical
flower
gardens
on
the
miles
of
great
platforms
at
the
river's
edge
all
this
masonry
all
this
architecture
represents
piety
the
palaces
were
built
by
native
princes
whose
homes
as
a
rule
are
far
from
benares
but
who
go
there
from
time
to
time
to
refresh
their
souls
with
the
sight
and
touch
of
the
ganges
the
river
of
their
idolatry
the
stairways
are
records
of
acts
of
piety
the
crowd
of
costly
little
temples
are
tokens
of
money
spent
by
rich
men
for
present
credit
and
hope
of
future
reward
apparently
the
rich
christian
who
spends
large
sums
upon
his
religion
is
conspicuous
with
us
by
his
rarity
but
the
rich
hindoo
who
doesn't
spend
large
sums
upon
his
religion
is
seemingly
non
existent
with
us
the
poor
spend
money
on
their
religion
but
they
keep
back
some
to
live
on
apparently
in
india
the
poor
bankrupt
themselves
daily
for
their
religion
the
rich
hindoo
can
afford
his
pious
outlays
he
gets
much
glory
for
his
spendings
yet
keeps
back
a
sufficiency
of
his
income
for
temporal
purposes
but
the
poor
hindoo
is
entitled
to
compassion
for
his
spendings
keep
him
poor
yet
get
him
no
glory
we
made
the
usual
trip
up
and
down
the
river
seated
in
chairs
under
an
awning
on
the
deck
of
the
usual
commodious
hand
propelled
ark
made
it
two
or
three
times
and
could
have
made
it
with
increasing
interest
and
enjoyment
many
times
more
for
of
course
the
palaces
and
temples
would
grow
more
and
more
beautiful
every
time
one
saw
them
for
that
happens
with
all
such
things
also
i
think
one
would
not
get
tired
of
the
bathers
nor
their
costumes
nor
of
their
ingenuities
in
getting
out
of
them
and
into
them
again
without
exposing
too
much
bronze
nor
of
their
devotional
gesticulations
and
absorbed
bead
tellings
but
i
should
get
tired
of
seeing
them
wash
their
mouths
with
that
dreadful
water
and
drink
it
in
fact
i
did
get
tired
of
it
and
very
early
too
at
one
place
where
we
halted
for
a
while
the
foul
gush
from
a
sewer
was
making
the
water
turbid
and
murky
all
around
and
there
was
a
random
corpse
slopping
around
in
it
that
had
floated
down
from
up
country
ten
steps
below
that
place
stood
a
crowd
of
men
women
and
comely
young
maidens
waist
deep
in
the
water
and
they
were
scooping
it
up
in
their
hands
and
drinking
it
faith
can
certainly
do
wonders
and
this
is
an
instance
of
it
those
people
were
not
drinking
that
fearful
stuff
to
assuage
thirst
but
in
order
to
purify
their
souls
and
the
interior
of
their
bodies
according
to
their
creed
the
ganges
water
makes
everything
pure
that
it
touches
instantly
and
utterly
pure
the
sewer
water
was
not
an
offence
to
them
the
corpse
did
not
revolt
them
the
sacred
water
had
touched
both
and
both
were
now
snow
pure
and
could
defile
no
one
the
memory
of
that
sight
will
always
stay
by
me
but
not
by
request
a
word
further
concerning
the
nasty
but
all
purifying
ganges
water
when
we
went
to
agra
by
and
by
we
happened
there
just
in
time
to
be
in
at
the
birth
of
a
marvel
a
memorable
scientific
discovery
the
discovery
that
in
certain
ways
the
foul
and
derided
ganges
water
is
the
most
puissant
purifier
in
the
world!
this
curious
fact
as
i
have
said
had
just
been
added
to
the
treasury
of
modern
science
it
had
long
been
noted
as
a
strange
thing
that
while
benares
is
often
afflicted
with
the
cholera
she
does
not
spread
it
beyond
her
borders
this
could
not
be
accounted
for
mr
henkin
the
scientist
in
the
employ
of
the
government
of
agra
concluded
to
examine
the
water
he
went
to
benares
and
made
his
tests
he
got
water
at
the
mouths
of
the
sewers
where
they
empty
into
the
river
at
the
bathing
ghats
a
cubic
centimetre
of
it
contained
millions
of
germs
at
the
end
of
six
hours
they
were
all
dead
he
caught
a
floating
corpse
towed
it
to
the
shore
and
from
beside
it
he
dipped
up
water
that
was
swarming
with
cholera
germs
at
the
end
of
six
hours
they
were
all
dead
he
added
swarm
after
swarm
of
cholera
germs
to
this
water
within
the
six
hours
they
always
died
to
the
last
sample
repeatedly
he
took
pure
well
water
which
was
bare
of
animal
life
and
put
into
it
a
few
cholera
germs
they
always
began
to
propagate
at
once
and
always
within
six
hours
they
swarmed
and
were
numberable
by
millions
upon
millions
for
ages
and
ages
the
hindoos
have
had
absolute
faith
that
the
water
of
the
ganges
was
absolutely
pure
could
not
be
defiled
by
any
contact
whatsoever
and
infallibly
made
pure
and
clean
whatsoever
thing
touched
it
they
still
believe
it
and
that
is
why
they
bathe
in
it
and
drink
it
caring
nothing
for
its
seeming
filthiness
and
the
floating
corpses
the
hindoos
have
been
laughed
at
these
many
generations
but
the
laughter
will
need
to
modify
itself
a
little
from
now
on
how
did
they
find
out
the
water's
secret
in
those
ancient
ages
had
they
germ
scientists
then
we
do
not
know
we
only
know
that
they
had
a
civilization
long
before
we
emerged
from
savagery
but
to
return
to
where
i
was
before
i
was
about
to
speak
of
the
burning
ghat
they
do
not
burn
fakeers
those
revered
mendicants
they
are
so
holy
that
they
can
get
to
their
place
without
that
sacrament
provided
they
be
consigned
to
the
consecrating
river
we
saw
one
carried
to
mid
stream
and
thrown
overboard
he
was
sandwiched
between
two
great
slabs
of
stone
we
lay
off
the
cremation
ghat
half
an
hour
and
saw
nine
corpses
burned
i
should
not
wish
to
see
any
more
of
it
unless
i
might
select
the
parties
the
mourners
follow
the
bier
through
the
town
and
down
to
the
ghat
then
the
bier
bearers
deliver
the
body
to
some
low
caste
natives
doms
and
the
mourners
turn
about
and
go
back
home
i
heard
no
crying
and
saw
no
tears
there
was
no
ceremony
of
parting
apparently
these
expressions
of
grief
and
affection
are
reserved
for
the
privacy
of
the
home
the
dead
women
came
draped
in
red
the
men
in
white
they
are
laid
in
the
water
at
the
river's
edge
while
the
pyre
is
being
prepared
the
first
subject
was
a
man
when
the
doms
unswathed
him
to
wash
him
he
proved
to
be
a
sturdily
built
well
nourished
and
handsome
old
gentleman
with
not
a
sign
about
him
to
suggest
that
he
had
ever
been
ill
dry
wood
was
brought
and
built
up
into
a
loose
pile
the
corpse
was
laid
upon
it
and
covered
over
with
fuel
then
a
naked
holy
man
who
was
sitting
on
high
ground
a
little
distance
away
began
to
talk
and
shout
with
great
energy
and
he
kept
up
this
noise
right
along
it
may
have
been
the
funeral
sermon
and
probably
was
i
forgot
to
say
that
one
of
the
mourners
remained
behind
when
the
others
went
away
this
was
the
dead
man's
son
a
boy
of
ten
or
twelve
brown
and
handsome
grave
and
self
possessed
and
clothed
in
flowing
white
he
was
there
to
burn
his
father
he
was
given
a
torch
and
while
he
slowly
walked
seven
times
around
the
pyre
the
naked
black
man
on
the
high
ground
poured
out
his
sermon
more
clamorously
than
ever
the
seventh
circuit
completed
the
boy
applied
the
torch
at
his
father's
head
then
at
his
feet
the
flames
sprang
briskly
up
with
a
sharp
crackling
noise
and
the
lad
went
away
hindoos
do
not
want
daughters
because
their
weddings
make
such
a
ruinous
expense
but
they
want
sons
so
that
at
death
they
may
have
honorable
exit
from
the
world
and
there
is
no
honor
equal
to
the
honor
of
having
one's
pyre
lighted
by
one's
son
the
father
who
dies
sonless
is
in
a
grievous
situation
indeed
and
is
pitied
life
being
uncertain
the
hindoo
marries
while
he
is
still
a
boy
in
the
hope
that
he
will
have
a
son
ready
when
the
day
of
his
need
shall
come
but
if
he
have
no
son
he
will
adopt
one
this
answers
every
purpose
meantime
the
corpse
is
burning
also
several
others
it
is
a
dismal
business
the
stokers
did
not
sit
down
in
idleness
but
moved
briskly
about
punching
up
the
fires
with
long
poles
and
now
and
then
adding
fuel
sometimes
they
hoisted
the
half
of
a
skeleton
into
the
air
then
slammed
it
down
and
beat
it
with
the
pole
breaking
it
up
so
that
it
would
burn
better
they
hoisted
skulls
up
in
the
same
way
and
banged
and
battered
them
the
sight
was
hard
to
bear
it
would
have
been
harder
if
the
mourners
had
stayed
to
witness
it
i
had
but
a
moderate
desire
to
see
a
cremation
so
it
was
soon
satisfied
for
sanitary
reasons
it
would
be
well
if
cremation
were
universal
but
this
form
is
revolting
and
not
to
be
recommended
the
fire
used
is
sacred
of
course
for
there
is
money
in
it
ordinary
fire
is
forbidden
there
is
no
money
in
it
i
was
told
that
this
sacred
fire
is
all
furnished
by
one
person
and
that
he
has
a
monopoly
of
it
and
charges
a
good
price
for
it
sometimes
a
rich
mourner
pays
a
thousand
rupees
for
it
to
get
to
paradise
from
india
is
an
expensive
thing
every
detail
connected
with
the
matter
costs
something
and
helps
to
fatten
a
priest
i
suppose
it
is
quite
safe
to
conclude
that
that
fire
bug
is
in
holy
orders
close
to
the
cremation
ground
stand
a
few
time
worn
stones
which
are
remembrances
of
the
suttee
each
has
a
rough
carving
upon
it
representing
a
man
and
a
woman
standing
or
walking
hand
in
hand
and
marks
the
spot
where
a
widow
went
to
her
death
by
fire
in
the
days
when
the
suttee
flourished
mr
parker
said
that
widows
would
burn
themselves
now
if
the
government
would
allow
it
the
family
that
can
point
to
one
of
these
little
memorials
and
say
she
who
burned
herself
there
was
an
ancestress
of
ours
is
envied
it
is
a
curious
people
with
them
all
life
seems
to
be
sacred
except
human
life
even
the
life
of
vermin
is
sacred
and
must
not
be
taken
the
good
jain
wipes
off
a
seat
before
using
it
lest
he
cause
the
death
of
some
valueless
insect
by
sitting
down
on
it
it
grieves
him
to
have
to
drink
water
because
the
provisions
in
his
stomach
may
not
agree
with
the
microbes
yet
india
invented
thuggery
and
the
suttee
india
is
a
hard
country
to
understand
we
went
to
the
temple
of
the
thug
goddess
bhowanee
or
kali
or
durga
she
has
these
names
and
others
she
is
the
only
god
to
whom
living
sacrifices
are
made
goats
are
sacrificed
to
her
monkeys
would
be
cheaper
there
are
plenty
of
them
about
the
place
being
sacred
they
make
themselves
very
free
and
scramble
around
wherever
they
please
the
temple
and
its
porch
are
beautifully
carved
but
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
idol
bhowanee
is
not
pleasant
to
look
at
she
has
a
silver
face
and
a
projecting
swollen
tongue
painted
a
deep
red
she
wears
a
necklace
of
skulls
in
fact
none
of
the
idols
in
benares
are
handsome
or
attractive
and
what
a
swarm
of
them
there
is!
the
town
is
a
vast
museum
of
idols
and
all
of
them
crude
misshapen
and
ugly
they
flock
through
one's
dreams
at
night
a
wild
mob
of
nightmares
when
you
get
tired
of
them
in
the
temples
and
take
a
trip
on
the
river
you
find
idol
giants
flashily
painted
stretched
out
side
by
side
on
the
shore
and
apparently
wherever
there
is
room
for
one
more
lingam
a
lingam
is
there
if
vishnu
had
foreseen
what
his
town
was
going
to
be
he
would
have
called
it
idolville
or
lingamburg
the
most
conspicuous
feature
of
benares
is
the
pair
of
slender
white
minarets
which
tower
like
masts
from
the
great
mosque
of
aurangzeb
they
seem
to
be
always
in
sight
from
everywhere
those
airy
graceful
inspiring
things
but
masts
is
not
the
right
word
for
masts
have
a
perceptible
taper
while
these
minarets
have
not
they
are
142
feet
high
and
only
8
1/2
feet
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
7
1/2
at
the
summit
scarcely
any
taper
at
all
these
are
the
proportions
of
a
candle
and
fair
and
fairylike
candles
these
are
will
be
anyway
some
day
when
the
christians
inherit
them
and
top
them
with
the
electric
light
there
is
a
great
view
from
up
there
a
wonderful
view
a
large
gray
monkey
was
part
of
it
and
damaged
it
a
monkey
has
no
judgment
this
one
was
skipping
about
the
upper
great
heights
of
the
mosque
skipping
across
empty
yawning
intervals
which
were
almost
too
wide
for
him
and
which
he
only
just
barely
cleared
each
time
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
he
got
me
so
nervous
that
i
couldn't
look
at
the
view
i
couldn't
look
at
anything
but
him
every
time
he
went
sailing
over
one
of
those
abysses
my
breath
stood
still
and
when
he
grabbed
for
the
perch
he
was
going
for
i
grabbed
too
in
sympathy
and
he
was
perfectly
indifferent
perfectly
unconcerned
and
i
did
all
the
panting
myself
he
came
within
an
ace
of
losing
his
life
a
dozen
times
and
i
was
so
troubled
about
him
that
i
would
have
shot
him
if
i
had
had
anything
to
do
it
with
but
i
strongly
recommend
the
view
there
is
more
monkey
than
view
and
there
is
always
going
to
be
more
monkey
while
that
idiot
survives
but
what
view
you
get
is
superb
all
benares
the
river
and
the
region
round
about
are
spread
before
you
take
a
gun
and
look
at
the
view
the
next
thing
i
saw
was
more
reposeful
it
was
a
new
kind
of
art
it
was
a
picture
painted
on
water
it
was
done
by
a
native
he
sprinkled
fine
dust
of
various
colors
on
the
still
surface
of
a
basin
of
water
and
out
of
these
sprinklings
a
dainty
and
pretty
picture
gradually
grew
a
picture
which
a
breath
could
destroy
somehow
it
was
impressive
after
so
much
browsing
among
massive
and
battered
and
decaying
fanes
that
rest
upon
ruins
and
those
ruins
upon
still
other
ruins
and
those
upon
still
others
again
it
was
a
sermon
an
allegory
a
symbol
of
instability
those
creations
in
stone
were
only
a
kind
of
water
pictures
after
all
a
prominent
episode
in
the
indian
career
of
warren
hastings
had
benares
for
its
theater
wherever
that
extraordinary
man
set
his
foot
he
left
his
mark
he
came
to
benares
in
1781
to
collect
a
fine
of
l500
000
which
he
had
levied
upon
its
rajah
cheit
singly
on
behalf
of
the
east
india
company
hastings
was
a
long
way
from
home
and
help
there
were
probably
not
a
dozen
englishmen
within
reach
the
rajah
was
in
his
fort
with
his
myriads
around
him
but
no
matter
from
his
little
camp
in
a
neighboring
garden
hastings
sent
a
party
to
arrest
the
sovereign
he
sent
on
this
daring
mission
a
couple
of
hundred
native
soldiers
sepoys
under
command
of
three
young
english
lieutenants
the
rajah
submitted
without
a
word
the
incident
lights
up
the
indian
situation
electrically
and
gives
one
a
vivid
sense
of
the
strides
which
the
english
had
made
and
the
mastership
they
had
acquired
in
the
land
since
the
date
of
clive's
great
victory
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
from
being
nobodies
and
feared
by
none
they
were
become
confessed
lords
and
masters
feared
by
all
sovereigns
included
and
served
by
all
sovereigns
included
it
makes
the
fairy
tales
sound
true
the
english
had
not
been
afraid
to
enlist
native
soldiers
to
fight
against
their
own
people
and
keep
them
obedient
and
now
hastings
was
not
afraid
to
come
away
out
to
this
remote
place
with
a
handful
of
such
soldiers
and
send
them
to
arrest
a
native
sovereign
the
lieutenants
imprisoned
the
rajah
in
his
own
fort
it
was
beautiful
the
pluckiness
of
it
the
impudence
of
it
the
arrest
enraged
the
rajah's
people
and
all
benares
came
storming
about
the
place
and
threatening
vengeance
and
yet
but
for
an
accident
nothing
important
would
have
resulted
perhaps
the
mob
found
out
a
most
strange
thing
an
almost
incredible
thing
that
this
handful
of
soldiers
had
come
on
this
hardy
errand
with
empty
guns
and
no
ammunition
this
has
been
attributed
to
thoughtlessness
but
it
could
hardly
have
been
that
for
in
such
large
emergencies
as
this
intelligent
people
do
think
it
must
have
been
indifference
an
over
confidence
born
of
the
proved
submissiveness
of
the
native
character
when
confronted
by
even
one
or
two
stern
britons
in
their
war
paint
but
however
that
may
be
it
was
a
fatal
discovery
that
the
mob
had
made
they
were
full
of
courage
now
and
they
broke
into
the
fort
and
massacred
the
helpless
soldiers
and
their
officers
hastings
escaped
from
benares
by
night
and
got
safely
away
leaving
the
principality
in
a
state
of
wild
insurrection
but
he
was
back
again
within
the
month
and
quieted
it
down
in
his
prompt
and
virile
way
and
took
the
rajah's
throne
away
from
him
and
gave
it
to
another
man
he
was
a
capable
kind
of
person
was
warren
hastings
this
was
the
only
time
he
was
ever
out
of
ammunition
some
of
his
acts
have
left
stains
upon
his
name
which
can
never
be
washed
away
but
he
saved
to
england
the
indian
empire
and
that
was
the
best
service
that
was
ever
done
to
the
indians
themselves
those
wretched
heirs
of
a
hundred
centuries
of
pitiless
oppression
and
abuse
chapter
liii
true
irreverence
is
disrespect
for
another
man's
god
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
it
was
in
benares
that
i
saw
another
living
god
that
makes
two
i
believe
i
have
seen
most
of
the
greater
and
lesser
wonders
of
the
world
but
i
do
not
remember
that
any
of
them
interested
me
so
overwhelmingly
as
did
that
pair
of
gods
when
i
try
to
account
for
this
effect
i
find
no
difficulty
about
it
i
find
that
as
a
rule
when
a
thing
is
a
wonder
to
us
it
is
not
because
of
what
we
see
in
it
but
because
of
what
others
have
seen
in
it
we
get
almost
all
our
wonders
at
second
hand
we
are
eager
to
see
any
celebrated
thing
and
we
never
fail
of
our
reward
just
the
deep
privilege
of
gazing
upon
an
object
which
has
stirred
the
enthusiasm
or
evoked
the
reverence
or
affection
or
admiration
of
multitudes
of
our
race
is
a
thing
which
we
value
we
are
profoundly
glad
that
we
have
seen
it
we
are
permanently
enriched
from
having
seen
it
we
would
not
part
with
the
memory
of
that
experience
for
a
great
price
and
yet
that
very
spectacle
may
be
the
taj
you
cannot
keep
your
enthusiasms
down
you
cannot
keep
your
emotions
within
bounds
when
that
soaring
bubble
of
marble
breaks
upon
your
view
but
these
are
not
your
enthusiasms
and
emotions
they
are
the
accumulated
emotions
and
enthusiasms
of
a
thousand
fervid
writers
who
have
been
slowly
and
steadily
storing
them
up
in
your
heart
day
by
day
and
year
by
year
all
your
life
and
now
they
burst
out
in
a
flood
and
overwhelm
you
and
you
could
not
be
a
whit
happier
if
they
were
your
very
own
by
and
by
you
sober
down
and
then
you
perceive
that
you
have
been
drunk
on
the
smell
of
somebody
else's
cork
for
ever
and
ever
the
memory
of
my
distant
first
glimpse
of
the
taj
will
compensate
me
for
creeping
around
the
globe
to
have
that
great
privilege
but
the
taj
with
all
your
inflation
of
delusive
emotions
acquired
at
second
hand
from
people
to
whom
in
the
majority
of
cases
they
were
also
delusions
acquired
at
second
hand
a
thing
which
you
fortunately
did
not
think
of
or
it
might
have
made
you
doubtful
of
what
you
imagined
were
your
own
what
is
the
taj
as
a
marvel
a
spectacle
and
an
uplifting
and
overpowering
wonder
compared
with
a
living
breathing
speaking
personage
whom
several
millions
of
human
beings
devoutly
and
sincerely
and
unquestioningly
believe
to
be
a
god
and
humbly
and
gratefully
worship
as
a
god
he
was
sixty
years
old
when
i
saw
him
he
is
called
sri
108
swami
bhaskarananda
saraswati
that
is
one
form
of
it
i
think
that
that
is
what
you
would
call
him
in
speaking
to
him
because
it
is
short
but
you
would
use
more
of
his
name
in
addressing
a
letter
to
him
courtesy
would
require
this
even
then
you
would
not
have
to
use
all
of
it
but
only
this
much
sri
108
matparamahansrzpairivrajakacharyaswamibhaskaranandasaraswati
you
do
not
put
esq
after
it
for
that
is
not
necessary
the
word
which
opens
the
volley
is
itself
a
title
of
honor
sri
the
108
stands
for
the
rest
of
his
names
i
believe
vishnu
has
108
names
which
he
does
not
use
in
business
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
custom
of
gods
and
a
privilege
sacred
to
their
order
to
keep
108
extra
ones
in
stock
just
the
restricted
name
set
down
above
is
a
handsome
property
without
the
108
by
my
count
it
has
58
letters
in
it
this
removes
the
long
german
words
from
competition
they
are
permanently
out
of
the
race
sri
108
s
b
saraswati
has
attained
to
what
among
the
hindoos
is
called
the
state
of
perfection
it
is
a
state
which
other
hindoos
reach
by
being
born
again
and
again
and
over
and
over
again
into
this
world
through
one
re
incarnation
after
another
a
tiresome
long
job
covering
centuries
and
decades
of
centuries
and
one
that
is
full
of
risks
too
like
the
accident
of
dying
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
ganges
some
time
or
other
and
waking
up
in
the
form
of
an
ass
with
a
fresh
start
necessary
and
the
numerous
trips
to
be
made
all
over
again
but
in
reaching
perfection
sri
108
s
b
s
has
escaped
all
that
he
is
no
longer
a
part
or
a
feature
of
this
world
his
substance
has
changed
all
earthiness
has
departed
out
of
it
he
is
utterly
holy
utterly
pure
nothing
can
desecrate
this
holiness
or
stain
this
purity
he
is
no
longer
of
the
earth
its
concerns
are
matters
foreign
to
him
its
pains
and
griefs
and
troubles
cannot
reach
him
when
he
dies
nirvana
is
his
he
will
be
absorbed
into
the
substance
of
the
supreme
deity
and
be
at
peace
forever
the
hindoo
scriptures
point
out
how
this
state
is
to
be
reached
but
it
is
only
once
in
a
thousand
years
perhaps
that
candidate
accomplishes
it
this
one
has
traversed
the
course
required
stage
by
stage
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
now
has
nothing
left
to
do
but
wait
for
the
call
which
shall
release
him
from
a
world
in
which
he
has
now
no
part
nor
lot
first
he
passed
through
the
student
stage
and
became
learned
in
the
holy
books
next
he
became
citizen
householder
husband
and
father
that
was
the
required
second
stage
then
like
john
bunyan's
christian
he
bade
perpetual
good
bye
to
his
family
as
required
and
went
wandering
away
he
went
far
into
the
desert
and
served
a
term
as
hermit
next
he
became
a
beggar
in
accordance
with
the
rites
laid
down
in
the
scriptures
and
wandered
about
india
eating
the
bread
of
mendicancy
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
he
reached
the
stage
of
purity
this
needs
no
garment
its
symbol
is
nudity
he
discarded
the
waist
cloth
which
he
had
previously
worn
he
could
resume
it
now
if
he
chose
for
neither
that
nor
any
other
contact
can
defile
him
but
he
does
not
choose
there
are
several
other
stages
i
believe
but
i
do
not
remember
what
they
are
but
he
has
been
through
them
throughout
the
long
course
he
was
perfecting
himself
in
holy
learning
and
writing
commentaries
upon
the
sacred
books
he
was
also
meditating
upon
brahma
and
he
does
that
now
white
marble
relief
portraits
of
him
are
sold
all
about
india
he
lives
in
a
good
house
in
a
noble
great
garden
in
benares
all
meet
and
proper
to
his
stupendous
rank
necessarily
he
does
not
go
abroad
in
the
streets
deities
would
never
be
able
to
move
about
handily
in
any
country
if
one
whom
we
recognized
and
adored
as
a
god
should
go
abroad
in
our
streets
and
the
day
it
was
to
happen
were
known
all
traffic
would
be
blocked
and
business
would
come
to
a
standstill
this
god
is
comfortably
housed
and
yet
modestly
all
things
considered
for
if
he
wanted
to
live
in
a
palace
he
would
only
need
to
speak
and
his
worshipers
would
gladly
build
it
sometimes
he
sees
devotees
for
a
moment
and
comforts
them
and
blesses
them
and
they
kiss
his
feet
and
go
away
happy
rank
is
nothing
to
him
he
being
a
god
to
him
all
men
are
alike
he
sees
whom
he
pleases
and
denies
himself
to
whom
he
pleases
sometimes
he
sees
a
prince
and
denies
himself
to
a
pauper
at
other
times
he
receives
the
pauper
and
turns
the
prince
away
however
he
does
not
receive
many
of
either
class
he
has
to
husband
his
time
for
his
meditations
i
think
he
would
receive
rev
mr
parker
at
any
time
i
think
he
is
sorry
for
mr
parker
and
i
think
mr
parker
is
sorry
for
him
and
no
doubt
this
compassion
is
good
for
both
of
them
when
we
arrived
we
had
to
stand
around
in
the
garden
a
little
while
and
wait
and
the
outlook
was
not
good
for
he
had
been
turning
away
maharajas
that
day
and
receiving
only
the
riff
raff
and
we
belonged
in
between
somewhere
but
presently
a
servant
came
out
saying
it
was
all
right
he
was
coming
and
sure
enough
he
came
and
i
saw
him
that
object
of
the
worship
of
millions
it
was
a
strange
sensation
and
thrilling
i
wish
i
could
feel
it
stream
through
my
veins
again
and
yet
to
me
he
was
not
a
god
he
was
only
a
taj
the
thrill
was
not
my
thrill
but
had
come
to
me
secondhand
from
those
invisible
millions
of
believers
by
a
hand
shake
with
their
god
i
had
ground
circuited
their
wire
and
got
their
monster
battery's
whole
charge
he
was
tall
and
slender
indeed
emaciated
he
had
a
clean
cut
and
conspicuously
intellectual
face
and
a
deep
and
kindly
eye
he
looked
many
years
older
than
he
really
was
but
much
study
and
meditation
and
fasting
and
prayer
with
the
arid
life
he
had
led
as
hermit
and
beggar
could
account
for
that
he
is
wholly
nude
when
he
receives
natives
of
whatever
rank
they
may
be
but
he
had
white
cloth
around
his
loins
now
a
concession
to
mr
parker's
europe
prejudices
no
doubt
as
soon
as
i
had
sobered
down
a
little
we
got
along
very
well
together
and
i
found
him
a
most
pleasant
and
friendly
deity
he
had
heard
a
deal
about
chicago
and
showed
a
quite
remarkable
interest
in
it
for
a
god
it
all
came
of
the
world's
fair
and
the
congress
of
religions
if
india
knows
about
nothing
else
american
she
knows
about
those
and
will
keep
them
in
mind
one
while
he
proposed
an
exchange
of
autographs
a
delicate
attention
which
made
me
believe
in
him
but
i
had
been
having
my
doubts
before
he
wrote
his
in
his
book
and
i
have
a
reverent
regard
for
that
book
though
the
words
run
from
right
to
left
and
so
i
can't
read
it
it
was
a
mistake
to
print
in
that
way
it
contains
his
voluminous
comments
on
the
hindoo
holy
writings
and
if
i
could
make
them
out
i
would
try
for
perfection
myself
i
gave
him
a
copy
of
huckleberry
finn
i
thought
it
might
rest
him
up
a
little
to
mix
it
in
along
with
his
meditations
on
brahma
for
he
looked
tired
and
i
knew
that
if
it
didn't
do
him
any
good
it
wouldn't
do
him
any
harm
he
has
a
scholar
meditating
under
him
mina
bahadur
rana
but
we
did
not
see
him
he
wears
clothes
and
is
very
imperfect
he
has
written
a
little
pamphlet
about
his
master
and
i
have
that
it
contains
a
wood
cut
of
the
master
and
himself
seated
on
a
rug
in
the
garden
the
portrait
of
the
master
is
very
good
indeed
the
posture
is
exactly
that
which
brahma
himself
affects
and
it
requires
long
arms
and
limber
legs
and
can
be
accumulated
only
by
gods
and
the
india
rubber
man
there
is
a
life
size
marble
relief
of
shri
108
s
b
s
in
the
garden
it
represents
him
in
this
same
posture
dear
me!
it
is
a
strange
world
particularly
the
indian
division
of
it
this
pupil
mina
bahadur
rana
is
not
a
commonplace
person
but
a
man
of
distinguished
capacities
and
attainments
and
apparently
he
had
a
fine
worldly
career
in
front
of
him
he
was
serving
the
nepal
government
in
a
high
capacity
at
the
court
of
the
viceroy
of
india
twenty
years
ago
he
was
an
able
man
educated
a
thinker
a
man
of
property
but
the
longing
to
devote
himself
to
a
religious
life
came
upon
him
and
he
resigned
his
place
turned
his
back
upon
the
vanities
and
comforts
of
the
world
and
went
away
into
the
solitudes
to
live
in
a
hut
and
study
the
sacred
writings
and
meditate
upon
virtue
and
holiness
and
seek
to
attain
them
this
sort
of
religion
resembles
ours
christ
recommended
the
rich
to
give
away
all
their
property
and
follow
him
in
poverty
not
in
worldly
comfort
american
and
english
millionaires
do
it
every
day
and
thus
verify
and
confirm
to
the
world
the
tremendous
forces
that
lie
in
religion
yet
many
people
scoff
at
them
for
this
loyalty
to
duty
and
many
will
scoff
at
mina
bahadur
rana
and
call
him
a
crank
like
many
christians
of
great
character
and
intellect
he
has
made
the
study
of
his
scriptures
and
the
writing
of
books
of
commentaries
upon
them
the
loving
labor
of
his
life
like
them
he
has
believed
that
his
was
not
an
idle
and
foolish
waste
of
his
life
but
a
most
worthy
and
honorable
employment
of
it
yet
there
are
many
people
who
will
see
in
those
others
men
worthy
of
homage
and
deep
reverence
but
in
him
merely
a
crank
but
i
shall
not
he
has
my
reverence
and
i
don't
offer
it
as
a
common
thing
and
poor
but
as
an
unusual
thing
and
of
value
the
ordinary
reverence
the
reverence
defined
and
explained
by
the
dictionary
costs
nothing
reverence
for
one's
own
sacred
things
parents
religion
flag
laws
and
respect
for
one's
own
beliefs
these
are
feelings
which
we
cannot
even
help
they
come
natural
to
us
they
are
involuntary
like
breathing
there
is
no
personal
merit
in
breathing
but
the
reverence
which
is
difficult
and
which
has
personal
merit
in
it
is
the
respect
which
you
pay
without
compulsion
to
the
political
or
religious
attitude
of
a
man
whose
beliefs
are
not
yours
you
can't
revere
his
gods
or
his
politics
and
no
one
expects
you
to
do
that
but
you
could
respect
his
belief
in
them
if
you
tried
hard
enough
and
you
could
respect
him
too
if
you
tried
hard
enough
but
it
is
very
very
difficult
it
is
next
to
impossible
and
so
we
hardly
ever
try
if
the
man
doesn't
believe
as
we
do
we
say
he
is
a
crank
and
that
settles
it
i
mean
it
does
nowadays
because
now
we
can't
burn
him
we
are
always
canting
about
people's
irreverence
always
charging
this
offense
upon
somebody
or
other
and
thereby
intimating
that
we
are
better
than
that
person
and
do
not
commit
that
offense
ourselves
whenever
we
do
this
we
are
in
a
lying
attitude
and
our
speech
is
cant
for
none
of
us
are
reverent
in
a
meritorious
way
deep
down
in
our
hearts
we
are
all
irreverent
there
is
probably
not
a
single
exception
to
this
rule
in
the
earth
there
is
probably
not
one
person
whose
reverence
rises
higher
than
respect
for
his
own
sacred
things
and
therefore
it
is
not
a
thing
to
boast
about
and
be
proud
of
since
the
most
degraded
savage
has
that
and
like
the
best
of
us
has
nothing
higher
to
speak
plainly
we
despise
all
reverences
and
all
objects
of
reverence
which
are
outside
the
pale
of
our
own
list
of
sacred
things
and
yet
with
strange
inconsistency
we
are
shocked
when
other
people
despise
and
defile
the
things
which
are
holy
to
us
suppose
we
should
meet
with
a
paragraph
like
the
following
in
the
newspapers
yesterday
a
visiting
party
of
the
british
nobility
had
a
picnic
at
mount
vernon
and
in
the
tomb
of
washington
they
ate
their
luncheon
sang
popular
songs
played
games
and
danced
waltzes
and
polkas
should
we
be
shocked
should
we
feel
outraged
should
we
be
amazed
should
we
call
the
performance
a
desecration
yes
that
would
all
happen
we
should
denounce
those
people
in
round
terms
and
call
them
hard
names
and
suppose
we
found
this
paragraph
in
the
newspapers
yesterday
a
visiting
party
of
american
pork
millionaires
had
a
picnic
in
westminster
abbey
and
in
that
sacred
place
they
ate
their
luncheon
sang
popular
songs
played
games
and
danced
waltzes
and
polkas
would
the
english
be
shocked
would
they
feel
outraged
would
they
be
amazed
would
they
call
the
performance
a
desecration
that
would
all
happen
the
pork
millionaires
would
be
denounced
in
round
terms
they
would
be
called
hard
names
in
the
tomb
at
mount
vernon
lie
the
ashes
of
america's
most
honored
son
in
the
abbey
the
ashes
of
england's
greatest
dead
the
tomb
of
tombs
the
costliest
in
the
earth
the
wonder
of
the
world
the
taj
was
built
by
a
great
emperor
to
honor
the
memory
of
a
perfect
wife
and
perfect
mother
one
in
whom
there
was
no
spot
or
blemish
whose
love
was
his
stay
and
support
whose
life
was
the
light
of
the
world
to
him
in
it
her
ashes
lie
and
to
the
mohammedan
millions
of
india
it
is
a
holy
place
to
them
it
is
what
mount
vernon
is
to
americans
it
is
what
the
abbey
is
to
the
english
major
sleeman
wrote
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
the
italics
are
mine
i
would
here
enter
my
humble
protest
against
the
quadrille
and
lunch
parties
which
are
sometimes
given
to
european
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
station
at
this
imperial
tomb
drinking
and
dancing
are
no
doubt
very
good
things
in
their
season
but
they
are
sadly
out
of
place
in
a
sepulchre
were
there
any
americans
among
those
lunch
parties
if
they
were
invited
there
were
if
my
imagined
lunch
parties
in
westminster
and
the
tomb
of
washington
should
take
place
the
incident
would
cause
a
vast
outbreak
of
bitter
eloquence
about
barbarism
and
irreverence
and
it
would
come
from
two
sets
of
people
who
would
go
next
day
and
dance
in
the
taj
if
they
had
a
chance
as
we
took
our
leave
of
the
benares
god
and
started
away
we
noticed
a
group
of
natives
waiting
respectfully
just
within
the
gate
a
rajah
from
somewhere
in
india
and
some
people
of
lesser
consequence
the
god
beckoned
them
to
come
and
as
we
passed
out
the
rajah
was
kneeling
and
reverently
kissing
his
sacred
feet
if
barnum
but
barnum's
ambitions
are
at
rest
this
god
will
remain
in
the
holy
peace
and
seclusion
of
his
garden
undisturbed
barnum
could
not
have
gotten
him
anyway
still
he
would
have
found
a
substitute
that
would
answer
chapter
liv
do
not
undervalue
the
headache
while
it
is
at
its
sharpest
it
seems
a
bad
investment
but
when
relief
begins
the
unexpired
remainder
is
worth
$4
a
minute
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
a
comfortable
railway
journey
of
seventeen
and
a
half
hours
brought
us
to
the
capital
of
india
which
is
likewise
the
capital
of
bengal
calcutta
like
bombay
it
has
a
population
of
nearly
a
million
natives
and
a
small
gathering
of
white
people
it
is
a
huge
city
and
fine
and
is
called
the
city
of
palaces
it
is
rich
in
historical
memories
rich
in
british
achievement
military
political
commercial
rich
in
the
results
of
the
miracles
done
by
that
brace
of
mighty
magicians
clive
and
hastings
and
has
a
cloud
kissing
monument
to
one
ochterlony
it
is
a
fluted
candlestick
250
feet
high
this
lingam
is
the
only
large
monument
in
calcutta
i
believe
it
is
a
fine
ornament
and
will
keep
ochterlony
in
mind
wherever
you
are
in
calcutta
and
for
miles
around
you
can
see
it
and
always
when
you
see
it
you
think
of
ochterlony
and
so
there
is
not
an
hour
in
the
day
that
you
do
not
think
of
ochterlony
and
wonder
who
he
was
it
is
good
that
clive
cannot
come
back
for
he
would
think
it
was
for
plassey
and
then
that
great
spirit
would
be
wounded
when
the
revelation
came
that
it
was
not
clive
would
find
out
that
it
was
for
ochterlony
and
he
would
think
ochterlony
was
a
battle
and
he
would
think
it
was
a
great
one
too
and
he
would
say
with
three
thousand
i
whipped
sixty
thousand
and
founded
the
empire
and
there
is
no
monument
this
other
soldier
must
have
whipped
a
billion
with
a
dozen
and
saved
the
world
but
he
would
be
mistaken
ochterlony
was
a
man
not
a
battle
and
he
did
good
and
honorable
service
too
as
good
and
honorable
service
as
has
been
done
in
india
by
seventy
five
or
a
hundred
other
englishmen
of
courage
rectitude
and
distinguished
capacity
for
india
has
been
a
fertile
breeding
ground
of
such
men
and
remains
so
great
men
both
in
war
and
in
the
civil
service
and
as
modest
as
great
but
they
have
no
monuments
and
were
not
expecting
any
ochterlony
could
not
have
been
expecting
one
and
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
he
desired
one
certainly
not
until
clive
and
hastings
should
be
supplied
every
day
clive
and
hastings
lean
on
the
battlements
of
heaven
and
look
down
and
wonder
which
of
the
two
the
monument
is
for
and
they
fret
and
worry
because
they
cannot
find
out
and
so
the
peace
of
heaven
is
spoiled
for
them
and
lost
but
not
for
ochterlony
ochterlony
is
not
troubled
he
doesn't
suspect
that
it
is
his
monument
heaven
is
sweet
and
peaceful
to
him
there
is
a
sort
of
unfairness
about
it
all
indeed
if
monuments
were
always
given
in
india
for
high
achievements
duty
straitly
performed
and
smirchless
records
the
landscape
would
be
monotonous
with
them
the
handful
of
english
in
india
govern
the
indian
myriads
with
apparent
ease
and
without
noticeable
friction
through
tact
training
and
distinguished
administrative
ability
reinforced
by
just
and
liberal
laws
and
by
keeping
their
word
to
the
native
whenever
they
give
it
england
is
far
from
india
and
knows
little
about
the
eminent
services
performed
by
her
servants
there
for
it
is
the
newspaper
correspondent
who
makes
fame
and
he
is
not
sent
to
india
but
to
the
continent
to
report
the
doings
of
the
princelets
and
the
dukelets
and
where
they
are
visiting
and
whom
they
are
marrying
often
a
british
official
spends
thirty
or
forty
years
in
india
climbing
from
grade
to
grade
by
services
which
would
make
him
celebrated
anywhere
else
and
finishes
as
a
vice
sovereign
governing
a
great
realm
and
millions
of
subjects
then
he
goes
home
to
england
substantially
unknown
and
unheard
of
and
settles
down
in
some
modest
corner
and
is
as
one
extinguished
ten
years
later
there
is
a
twenty
line
obituary
in
the
london
papers
and
the
reader
is
paralyzed
by
the
splendors
of
a
career
which
he
is
not
sure
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
before
but
meanwhile
he
has
learned
all
about
the
continental
princelets
and
dukelets
the
average
man
is
profoundly
ignorant
of
countries
that
lie
remote
from
his
own
when
they
are
mentioned
in
his
presence
one
or
two
facts
and
maybe
a
couple
of
names
rise
like
torches
in
his
mind
lighting
up
an
inch
or
two
of
it
and
leaving
the
rest
all
dark
the
mention
of
egypt
suggests
some
biblical
facts
and
the
pyramids
nothing
more
the
mention
of
south
africa
suggests
kimberly
and
the
diamonds
and
there
an
end
formerly
the
mention
to
a
hindoo
of
america
suggested
a
name
george
washington
with
that
his
familiarity
with
our
country
was
exhausted
latterly
his
familiarity
with
it
has
doubled
in
bulk
so
that
when
america
is
mentioned
now
two
torches
flare
up
in
the
dark
caverns
of
his
mind
and
he
says
ah
the
country
of
the
great
man
washington
and
of
the
holy
city
chicago
for
he
knows
about
the
congress
of
religion
and
this
has
enabled
him
to
get
an
erroneous
impression
of
chicago
when
india
is
mentioned
to
the
citizen
of
a
far
country
it
suggests
clive
hastings
the
mutiny
kipling
and
a
number
of
other
great
events
and
the
mention
of
calcutta
infallibly
brings
up
the
black
hole
and
so
when
that
citizen
finds
himself
in
the
capital
of
india
he
goes
first
of
all
to
see
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
and
is
disappointed
the
black
hole
was
not
preserved
it
is
gone
long
long
ago
it
is
strange
just
as
it
stood
it
was
itself
a
monument
a
ready
made
one
it
was
finished
it
was
complete
its
materials
were
strong
and
lasting
it
needed
no
furbishing
up
no
repairs
it
merely
needed
to
be
let
alone
it
was
the
first
brick
the
foundation
stone
upon
which
was
reared
a
mighty
empire
the
indian
empire
of
great
britain
it
was
the
ghastly
episode
of
the
black
hole
that
maddened
the
british
and
brought
clive
that
young
military
marvel
raging
up
from
madras
it
was
the
seed
from
which
sprung
plassey
and
it
was
that
extraordinary
battle
whose
like
had
not
been
seen
in
the
earth
since
agincourt
that
laid
deep
and
strong
the
foundations
of
england's
colossal
indian
sovereignty
and
yet
within
the
time
of
men
who
still
live
the
black
hole
was
torn
down
and
thrown
away
as
carelessly
as
if
its
bricks
were
common
clay
not
ingots
of
historic
gold
there
is
no
accounting
for
human
beings
the
supposed
site
of
the
black
hole
is
marked
by
an
engraved
plate
i
saw
that
and
better
that
than
nothing
the
black
hole
was
a
prison
a
cell
is
nearer
the
right
word
eighteen
feet
square
the
dimensions
of
an
ordinary
bedchamber
and
into
this
place
the
victorious
nabob
of
bengal
packed
146
of
his
english
prisoners
there
was
hardly
standing
room
for
them
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
was
to
be
got
the
time
was
night
the
weather
sweltering
hot
before
the
dawn
came
the
captives
were
all
dead
but
twenty
three
mr
holwell's
long
account
of
the
awful
episode
was
familiar
to
the
world
a
hundred
years
ago
but
one
seldom
sees
in
print
even
an
extract
from
it
in
our
day
among
the
striking
things
in
it
is
this
mr
holwell
perishing
with
thirst
kept
himself
alive
by
sucking
the
perspiration
from
his
sleeves
it
gives
one
a
vivid
idea
of
the
situation
he
presently
found
that
while
he
was
busy
drawing
life
from
one
of
his
sleeves
a
young
english
gentleman
was
stealing
supplies
from
the
other
one
holwell
was
an
unselfish
man
a
man
of
the
most
generous
impulses
he
lived
and
died
famous
for
these
fine
and
rare
qualities
yet
when
he
found
out
what
was
happening
to
that
unwatched
sleeve
he
took
the
precaution
to
suck
that
one
dry
first
the
miseries
of
the
black
hole
were
able
to
change
even
a
nature
like
his
but
that
young
gentleman
was
one
of
the
twenty
three
survivors
and
he
said
it
was
the
stolen
perspiration
that
saved
his
life
from
the
middle
of
mr
holwell's
narrative
i
will
make
a
brief
excerpt
then
a
general
prayer
to
heaven
to
hasten
the
approach
of
the
flames
to
the
right
and
left
of
us
and
put
a
period
to
our
misery
but
these
failing
they
whose
strength
and
spirits
were
quite
exhausted
laid
themselves
down
and
expired
quietly
upon
their
fellows
others
who
had
yet
some
strength
and
vigor
left
made
a
last
effort
at
the
windows
and
several
succeeded
by
leaping
and
scrambling
over
the
backs
and
heads
of
those
in
the
first
rank
and
got
hold
of
the
bars
from
which
there
was
no
removing
them
many
to
the
right
and
left
sunk
with
the
violent
pressure
and
were
soon
suffocated
for
now
a
steam
arose
from
the
living
and
the
dead
which
affected
us
in
all
its
circumstances
as
if
we
were
forcibly
held
with
our
heads
over
a
bowl
full
of
strong
volatile
spirit
of
hartshorn
until
suffocated
nor
could
the
effluvia
of
the
one
be
distinguished
from
the
other
and
frequently
when
i
was
forced
by
the
load
upon
my
head
and
shoulders
to
hold
my
face
down
i
was
obliged
near
as
i
was
to
the
window
instantly
to
raise
it
again
to
avoid
suffocation
i
need
not
my
dear
friend
ask
your
commiseration
when
i
tell
you
that
in
this
plight
from
half
an
hour
past
eleven
till
near
two
in
the
morning
i
sustained
the
weight
of
a
heavy
man
with
his
knees
in
my
back
and
the
pressure
of
his
whole
body
on
my
head
a
dutch
surgeon
who
had
taken
his
seat
upon
my
left
shoulder
and
a
topaz
a
black
christian
soldier
bearing
on
my
right
all
which
nothing
could
have
enabled
me
to
support
but
the
props
and
pressure
equally
sustaining
me
all
around
the
two
latter
i
frequently
dislodged
by
shifting
my
hold
on
the
bars
and
driving
my
knuckles
into
their
ribs
but
my
friend
above
stuck
fast
held
immovable
by
two
bars
i
exerted
anew
my
strength
and
fortitude
but
the
repeated
trials
and
efforts
i
made
to
dislodge
the
insufferable
incumbrances
upon
me
at
last
quite
exhausted
me
and
towards
two
o'clock
finding
i
must
quit
the
window
or
sink
where
i
was
i
resolved
on
the
former
having
bore
truly
for
the
sake
of
others
infinitely
more
for
life
than
the
best
of
it
is
worth
in
the
rank
close
behind
me
was
an
officer
of
one
of
the
ships
whose
name
was
cary
and
who
had
behaved
with
much
bravery
during
the
siege
his
wife
a
fine
woman
though
country
born
would
not
quit
him
but
accompanied
him
into
the
prison
and
was
one
who
survived
this
poor
wretch
had
been
long
raving
for
water
and
air
i
told
him
i
was
determined
to
give
up
life
and
recommended
his
gaining
my
station
on
my
quitting
it
he
made
a
fruitless
attempt
to
get
my
place
but
the
dutch
surgeon
who
sat
on
my
shoulder
supplanted
him
poor
cary
expressed
his
thankfulness
and
said
he
would
give
up
life
too
but
it
was
with
the
utmost
labor
we
forced
our
way
from
the
window
several
in
the
inner
ranks
appearing
to
me
dead
standing
unable
to
fall
by
the
throng
and
equal
pressure
around
he
laid
himself
down
to
die
and
his
death
i
believe
was
very
sudden
for
he
was
a
short
full
sanguine
man
his
strength
was
great
and
i
imagine
had
he
not
retired
with
me
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
force
my
way
i
was
at
this
time
sensible
of
no
pain
and
little
uneasiness
i
can
give
you
no
better
idea
of
my
situation
than
by
repeating
my
simile
of
the
bowl
of
spirit
of
hartshorn
i
found
a
stupor
coming
on
apace
and
laid
myself
down
by
that
gallant
old
man
the
rev
mr
jervas
bellamy
who
laid
dead
with
his
son
the
lieutenant
hand
in
hand
near
the
southernmost
wall
of
the
prison
when
i
had
lain
there
some
little
time
i
still
had
reflection
enough
to
suffer
some
uneasiness
in
the
thought
that
i
should
be
trampled
upon
when
dead
as
i
myself
had
done
to
others
with
some
difficulty
i
raised
myself
and
gained
the
platform
a
second
time
where
i
presently
lost
all
sensation
the
last
trace
of
sensibility
that
i
have
been
able
to
recollect
after
my
laying
down
was
my
sash
being
uneasy
about
my
waist
which
i
untied
and
threw
from
me
of
what
passed
in
this
interval
to
the
time
of
my
resurrection
from
this
hole
of
horrors
i
can
give
you
no
account
there
was
plenty
to
see
in
calcutta
but
there
was
not
plenty
of
time
for
it
i
saw
the
fort
that
clive
built
and
the
place
where
warren
hastings
and
the
author
of
the
junius
letters
fought
their
duel
and
the
great
botanical
gardens
and
the
fashionable
afternoon
turnout
in
the
maidan
and
a
grand
review
of
the
garrison
in
a
great
plain
at
sunrise
and
a
military
tournament
in
which
great
bodies
of
native
soldiery
exhibited
the
perfection
of
their
drill
at
all
arms
a
spectacular
and
beautiful
show
occupying
several
nights
and
closing
with
the
mimic
storming
of
a
native
fort
which
was
as
good
as
the
reality
for
thrilling
and
accurate
detail
and
better
than
the
reality
for
security
and
comfort
we
had
a
pleasure
excursion
on
the
'hoogly'
by
courtesy
of
friends
and
devoted
the
rest
of
the
time
to
social
life
and
the
indian
museum
one
should
spend
a
month
in
the
museum
an
enchanted
palace
of
indian
antiquities
indeed
a
person
might
spend
half
a
year
among
the
beautiful
and
wonderful
things
without
exhausting
their
interest
it
was
winter
we
were
of
kipling's
hosts
of
tourists
who
travel
up
and
down
india
in
the
cold
weather
showing
how
things
ought
to
be
managed
it
is
a
common
expression
there
the
cold
weather
and
the
people
think
there
is
such
a
thing
it
is
because
they
have
lived
there
half
a
lifetime
and
their
perceptions
have
become
blunted
when
a
person
is
accustomed
to
138
in
the
shade
his
ideas
about
cold
weather
are
not
valuable
i
had
read
in
the
histories
that
the
june
marches
made
between
lucknow
and
cawnpore
by
the
british
forces
in
the
time
of
the
mutiny
were
made
weather
138
in
the
shade
and
had
taken
it
for
historical
embroidery
i
had
read
it
again
in
serjeant
major
forbes
mitchell's
account
of
his
military
experiences
in
the
mutiny
at
least
i
thought
i
had
and
in
calcutta
i
asked
him
if
it
was
true
and
he
said
it
was
an
officer
of
high
rank
who
had
been
in
the
thick
of
the
mutiny
said
the
same
as
long
as
those
men
were
talking
about
what
they
knew
they
were
trustworthy
and
i
believed
them
but
when
they
said
it
was
now
cold
weather
i
saw
that
they
had
traveled
outside
of
their
sphere
of
knowledge
and
were
floundering
i
believe
that
in
india
cold
weather
is
merely
a
conventional
phrase
and
has
come
into
use
through
the
necessity
of
having
some
way
to
distinguish
between
weather
which
will
melt
a
brass
door
knob
and
weather
which
will
only
make
it
mushy
it
was
observable
that
brass
ones
were
in
use
while
i
was
in
calcutta
showing
that
it
was
not
yet
time
to
change
to
porcelain
i
was
told
the
change
to
porcelain
was
not
usually
made
until
may
but
this
cold
weather
was
too
warm
for
us
so
we
started
to
darjeeling
in
the
himalayas
a
twenty
four
hour
journey

up
with

a

morning

frosty
a
double
suit
of
flannels
is

necessary
the

is
perfectly
level

seems
to
stretch
away
and
away
and
away
dimming
and
softening
to
the
uttermost
bounds
of
nowhere
what
a
soaring
strenuous
gushing
fountain
spray
of
delicate
greenery
a
bunch
of
bamboo
is!
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
these
grand
vegetable
geysers
grace
the
view
their
spoutings
refined
to
steam
by
distance
and
there
are
fields
of
bananas
with
the
sunshine
glancing
from
the
varnished
surface
of
their
drooping
vast
leaves
and
there
are
frequent
groves
of
palm
and
an
effective
accent
is
given
to
the
landscape
by
isolated
individuals
of
this
picturesque
family
towering
clean
stemmed
their
plumes
broken
and
hanging
ragged
nature's
imitation
of
an
umbrella
that
has
been
out
to
see
what
a
cyclone
is
like
and
is
trying
not
to
look
disappointed
and
everywhere
through
the
soft
morning
vistas
we
glimpse
the
villages
the
countless
villages
the
myriad
villages
thatched
built
of
clean
new
matting
snuggling
among
grouped
palms
and
sheaves
of
bamboo
villages
villages
no
end
of
villages
not
three
hundred
yards
apart
and
dozens
and
dozens
of
them
in
sight
all
the
time
a
mighty
city
hundreds
of
miles
long
hundreds
of
miles
broad
made
all
of
villages
the
biggest
city
in
the
earth
and
as
populous
as
a
european
kingdom
i
have
seen
no
such
city
as
this
before
and
there
is
a
continuously
repeated
and
replenished
multitude
of
naked
men
in
view
on
both
sides
and
ahead
we
fly
through
it
mile
after
mile
but
still
it
is
always
there
on
both
sides
and
ahead
brown
bodied
naked
men
and
boys
plowing
in
the
fields
but
not
woman
in
these
two
hours
i
have
not
seen
a
woman
or
a
girl
working
in
the
fields
from
greenland's
icy
mountains
from
india's
coral
strand
where
afric's
sunny
fountains
roll
down
their
golden
sand
from
many
an
ancient
river
from
many
a
palmy
plain
they
call
us
to
deliver
their
land
from
error's
chain
those
are
beautiful
verses
and
they
have
remained
in
my
memory
all
my
life
but
if
the
closing
lines
are
true
let
us
hope
that
when
we
come
to
answer
the
call
and
deliver
the
land
from
its
errors
we
shall
secrete
from
it
some
of
our
high
civilization
ways
and
at
the
same
time
borrow
some
of
its
pagan
ways
to
enrich
our
high
system
with
we
have
a
right
to
do
this
if
we
lift
those
people
up
we
have
a
right
to
lift
ourselves
up
nine
or
ten
grades
or
so
at
their
expense
a
few
years
ago
i
spent
several
weeks
at
tolz
in
bavaria
it
is
a
roman
catholic
region
and
not
even
benares
is
more
deeply
or
pervasively
or
intelligently
devout
in
my
diary
of
those
days
i
find
this
we
took
a
long
drive
yesterday
around
about
the
lovely
country
roads
but
it
was
a
drive
whose
pleasure
was
damaged
in
a
couple
of
ways
by
the
dreadful
shrines
and
by
the
shameful
spectacle
of
gray
and
venerable
old
grandmothers
toiling
in
the
fields
the
shrines
were
frequent
along
the
roads
figures
of
the
saviour
nailed
to
the
cross
and
streaming
with
blood
from
the
wounds
of
the
nails
and
the
thorns
when
missionaries
go
from
here
do
they
find
fault
with
the
pagan
idols
i
saw
many
women
seventy
and
even
eighty
years
old
mowing
and
binding
in
the
fields
and
pitchforking
the
loads
into
the
wagons
i
was
in
austria
later
and
in
munich
in
munich
i
saw
gray
old
women
pushing
trucks
up
hill
and
down
long
distances
trucks
laden
with
barrels
of
beer
incredible
loads
in
my
austrian
diary
i
find
this
in
the
fields
i
often
see
a
woman
and
a
cow
harnessed
to
the
plow
and
a
man
driving
in
the
public
street
of
marienbad
to
day
i
saw
an
old
bent
gray
headed
woman
in
harness
with
a
dog
drawing
a
laden
sled
over
bare
dirt
roads
and
bare
pavements
and
at
his
ease
walked
the
driver
smoking
his
pipe
a
hale
fellow
not
thirty
years
old
five
or
six
years
ago
i
bought
an
open
boat
made
a
kind
of
a
canvas
wagon
roof
over
the
stern
of
it
to
shelter
me
from
sun
and
rain
hired
a
courier
and
a
boatman
and
made
a
twelve
day
floating
voyage
down
the
rhone
from
lake
bourget
to
marseilles
in
my
diary
of
that
trip
i
find
this
entry
i
was
far
down
the
rhone
then
passing
st
etienne
2
15
p
m
on
a
distant
ridge
inland
a
tall
openwork
structure
commandingly
situated
with
a
statue
of
the
virgin
standing
on
it
a
devout
country
all
down
this
river
wherever
there
is
a
crag
there
is
a
statue
of
the
virgin
on
it
i
believe
i
have
seen
a
hundred
of
them
and
yet
in
many
respects
the
peasantry
seem
to
be
mere
pagans
and
destitute
of
any
considerable
degree
of
civilization
we
reached
a
not
very
promising
looking
village
about
4
o'clock
and
i
concluded
to
tie
up
for
the
day
munching
fruit
and
fogging
the
hood
with
pipe
smoke
had
grown
monotonous
i
could
not
have
the
hood
furled
because
the
floods
of
rain
fell
unceasingly
the
tavern
was
on
the
river
bank
as
is
the
custom
it
was
dull
there
and
melancholy
nothing
to
do
but
look
out
of
the
window
into
the
drenching
rain
and
shiver
one
could
do
that
for
it
was
bleak
and
cold
and
windy
and
country
france
furnishes
no
fire
winter
overcoats
did
not
help
me
much
they
had
to
be
supplemented
with
rugs
the
raindrops
were
so
large
and
struck
the
river
with
such
force
that
they
knocked
up
the
water
like
pebble
splashes
with
the
exception
of
a
very
occasional
woodenshod
peasant
nobody
was
abroad
in
this
bitter
weather
i
mean
nobody
of
our
sex
but
all
weathers
are
alike
to
the
women
in
these
continental
countries
to
them
and
the
other
animals
life
is
serious
nothing
interrupts
their
slavery
three
of
them
were
washing
clothes
in
the
river
under
the
window
when
i
arrived
and
they
continued
at
it
as
long
as
there
was
light
to
work
by
one
was
apparently
thirty
another
the
mother!
above
fifty
the
third
grandmother!
so
old
and
worn
and
gray
she
could
have
passed
for
eighty
i
took
her
to
be
that
old
they
had
no
waterproofs
nor
rubbers
of
course
over
their
shoulders
they
wore
gunnysacks
simply
conductors
for
rivers
of
water
some
of
the
volume
reached
the
ground
the
rest
soaked
in
on
the
way
at
last
a
vigorous
fellow
of
thirty
five
arrived
dry
and
comfortable
smoking
his
pipe
under
his
big
umbrella
in
an
open
donkey
cart
husband
son
and
grandson
of
those
women!
he
stood
up
in
the
cart
sheltering
himself
and
began
to
superintend
issuing
his
orders
in
a
masterly
tone
of
command
and
showing
temper
when
they
were
not
obeyed
swiftly
enough
without
complaint
or
murmur
the
drowned
women
patiently
carried
out
the
orders
lifting
the
immense
baskets
of
soggy
wrung
out
clothing
into
the
cart
and
stowing
them
to
the
man's
satisfaction
there
were
six
of
the
great
baskets
and
a
man
of
mere
ordinary
strength
could
not
have
lifted
any
one
of
them
the
cart
being
full
now
the
frenchman
descended
still
sheltered
by
his
umbrella
entered
the
tavern
and
the
women
went
drooping
homeward
trudging
in
the
wake
of
the
cart
and
soon
were
blended
with
the
deluge
and
lost
to
sight
when
i
went
down
into
the
public
room
the
frenchman
had
his
bottle
of
wine
and
plate
of
food
on
a
bare
table
black
with
grease
and
was
chomping
like
a
horse
he
had
the
little
religious
paper
which
is
in
everybody's
hands
on
the
rhone
borders
and
was
enlightening
himself
with
the
histories
of
french
saints
who
used
to
flee
to
the
desert
in
the
middle
ages
to
escape
the
contamination
of
woman
for
two
hundred
years
france
has
been
sending
missionaries
to
other
savage
lands
to
spare
to
the
needy
from
poverty
like
hers
is
fine
and
true
generosity
but
to
get
back
to
india
where
as
my
favorite
poem
says
every
prospect
pleases
and
only
man
is
vile
it
is
because
bavaria
and
austria
and
france
have
not
introduced
their
civilization
to
him
yet
but
bavaria
and
austria
and
france
are
on
their
way
they
are
coming
they
will
rescue
him
they
will
refine
the
vileness
out
of
him
some
time
during
the
forenoon
approaching
the
mountains
we
changed
from
the
regular
train
to
one
composed
of
little
canvas
sheltered
cars
that
skimmed
along
within
a
foot
of
the
ground
and
seemed
to
be
going
fifty
miles
an
hour
when
they
were
really
making
about
twenty
each
car
had
seating
capacity
for
half
a
dozen
persons
and
when
the
curtains
were
up
one
was
substantially
out
of
doors
and
could
see
everywhere
and
get
all
the
breeze
and
be
luxuriously
comfortable
it
was
not
a
pleasure
excursion
in
name
only
but
in
fact
after
a
while
the
stopped
at
a
little
wooden
coop
of
a
station
just
within
the
curtain
of
the
sombre
jungle
a
place
with
a
deep
and
dense
forest
of
great
trees
and
scrub
and
vines
all
about
it
the
royal
bengal
tiger
is
in
great
force
there
and
is
very
bold
and
unconventional
from
this
lonely
little
station
a
message
once
went
to
the
railway
manager
in
calcutta
tiger
eating
station
master
on
front
porch
telegraph
instructions
it
was
there
that
i
had
my
first
tiger
hunt
i
killed
thirteen
we
were
presently
away
again
and
the
train
began
to
climb
the
mountains
in
one
place
seven
wild
elephants
crossed
the
track
but
two
of
them
got
away
before
i
could
overtake
them
the
railway
journey
up
the
mountain
is
forty
miles
and
it
takes
eight
hours
to
make
it
it
is
so
wild
and
interesting
and
exciting
and
enchanting
that
it
ought
to
take
a
week
as
for
the
vegetation
it
is
a
museum
the
jungle
seemed
to
contain
samples
of
every
rare
and
curious
tree
and
bush
that
we
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
it
is
from
that
museum
i
think
that
the
globe
must
have
been
supplied
with
the
trees
and
vines
and
shrubs
that
it
holds
precious
the
road
is
infinitely
and
charmingly
crooked
it
goes
winding
in
and
out
under
lofty
cliffs
that
are
smothered
in
vines
and
foliage
and
around
the
edges
of
bottomless
chasms
and
all
the
way
one
glides
by
files
of
picturesque
natives
some
carrying
burdens
up
others
going
down
from
their
work
in
the
tea
gardens
and
once
there
was
a
gaudy
wedding
procession
all
bright
tinsel
and
color
and
a
bride
comely
and
girlish
who
peeped
out
from
the
curtains
of
her
palanquin
exposing
her
face
with
that
pure
delight
which
the
young
and
happy
take
in
sin
for
sin's
own
sake
by
and
by
we
were
well
up
in
the
region
of
the
clouds
and
from
that
breezy
height
we
looked
down
and
afar
over
a
wonderful
picture
the
plains
of
india
stretching
to
the
horizon
soft
and
fair
level
as
a
floor
shimmering
with
heat
mottled
with
cloud
shadows
and
cloven
with
shining
rivers
immediately
below
us
and
receding
down
down
down
toward
the
valley
was
a
shaven
confusion
of
hilltops
with
ribbony
roads
and
paths
squirming
and
snaking
cream
yellow
all
over
them
and
about
them
every
curve
and
twist
sharply
distinct
at
an
elevation
of
6
000
feet
we
entered
a
thick
cloud
and
it
shut
out
the
world
and
kept
it
shut
out
we
climbed
1
000
feet
higher
then
began
to
descend
and
presently
got
down
to
darjeeling
which
is
6
000
feet
above
the
level
of
the
plains
we
had
passed
many
a
mountain
village
on
the
way
up
and
seen
some
new
kinds
of
natives
among
them
many
samples
of
the
fighting
ghurkas
they
are
not
large
men
but
they
are
strong
and
resolute
there
are
no
better
soldiers
among
britain's
native
troops
and
we
had
passed
shoals
of
their
women
climbing
the
forty
miles
of
steep
road
from
the
valley
to
their
mountain
homes
with
tall
baskets
on
their
backs
hitched
to
their
foreheads
by
a
band
and
containing
a
freightage
weighing
i
will
not
say
how
many
hundreds
of
pounds
for
the
sum
is
unbelievable
these
were
young
women
and
they
strode
smartly
along
under
these
astonishing
burdens
with
the
air
of
people
out
for
a
holiday
i
was
told
that
a
woman
will
carry
a
piano
on
her
back
all
the
way
up
the
mountain
and
that
more
than
once
a
woman
had
done
it
if
these
were
old
women
i
should
regard
the
ghurkas
as
no
more
civilized
than
the
europeans
at
the
railway
station
at
darjeeling
you
find
plenty
of
cab
substitutes
open
coffins
in
which
you
sit
and
are
then
borne
on
men's
shoulders
up
the
steep
roads
into
the
town
up
there
we
found
a
fairly
comfortable
hotel
the
property
of
an
indiscriminate
and
incoherent
landlord
who
looks
after
nothing
but
leaves
everything
to
his
army
of
indian
servants
no
he
does
look
after
the
bill
to
be
just
to
him
and
the
tourist
cannot
do
better
than
follow
his
example
i
was
told
by
a
resident
that
the
summit
of
kinchinjunga
is
often
hidden
in
the
clouds
and
that
sometimes
a
tourist
has
waited
twenty
two
days
and
then
been
obliged
to
go
away
without
a
sight
of
it
and
yet
went
not
disappointed
for
when
he
got
his
hotel
bill
he
recognized
that
he
was
now
seeing
the
highest
thing
in
the
himalayas
but
this
is
probably
a
lie
after
lecturing
i
went
to
the
club
that
night
and
that
was
a
comfortable
place
it
is
loftily
situated
and
looks
out
over
a
vast
spread
of
scenery
from
it
you
can
see
where
the
boundaries
of
three
countries
come
together
some
thirty
miles
away
thibet
is
one
of
them
nepaul
another
and
i
think
herzegovina
was
the
other
apparently
in
every
town
and
city
in
india
the
gentlemen
of
the
british
civil
and
military
service
have
a
club
sometimes
it
is
a
palatial
one
always
it
is
pleasant
and
homelike
the
hotels
are
not
always
as
good
as
they
might
be
and
the
stranger
who
has
access
to
the
club
is
grateful
for
his
privilege
and
knows
how
to
value
it
next
day
was
sunday
friends
came
in
the
gray
dawn
with
horses
and
my
party
rode
away
to
a
distant
point
where
kinchinjunga
and
mount
everest
show
up
best
but
i
stayed
at
home
for
a
private
view
for
it
was
very
old
and
i
was
not
acquainted
with
the
horses
any
way
i
got
a
pipe
and
a
few
blankets
and
sat
for
two
hours
at
the
window
and
saw
the
sun
drive
away
the
veiling
gray
and
touch
up
the
snow
peaks
one
after
another
with
pale
pink
splashes
and
delicate
washes
of
gold
and
finally
flood
the
whole
mighty
convulsion
of
snow
mountains
with
a
deluge
of
rich
splendors
kinchinjunga's
peak
was
but
fitfully
visible
but
in
the
between
times
it
was
vividly
clear
against
the
sky
away
up
there
in
the
blue
dome
more
than
28
000
feet
above
sea
level
the
loftiest
land
i
had
ever
seen
by
12
000
feet
or
more
it
was
45
miles
away
mount
everest
is
a
thousand
feet
higher
but
it
was
not
a
part
of
that
sea
of
mountains
piled
up
there
before
me
so
i
did
not
see
it
but
i
did
not
care
because
i
think
that
mountains
that
are
as
high
as
that
are
disagreeable
i
changed
from
the
back
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
there
watching
the
swarthy
strange
tribes
flock
by
from
their
far
homes
in
the
himalayas
all
ages
and
both
sexes
were
represented
and
the
breeds
were
quite
new
to
me
though
the
costumes
of
the
thibetans
made
them
look
a
good
deal
like
chinamen
the
prayer
wheel
was
a
frequent
feature
it
brought
me
near
to
these
people
and
made
them
seem
kinfolk
of
mine
through
our
preacher
we
do
much
of
our
praying
by
proxy
we
do
not
whirl
him
around
a
stick
as
they
do
but
that
is
merely
a
detail
the
swarm
swung
briskly
by
hour
after
hour
a
strange
and
striking
pageant
it
was
wasted
there
and
it
seemed
a
pity
it
should
have
been
sent
streaming
through
the
cities
of
europe
or
america
to
refresh
eyes
weary
of
the
pale
monotonies
of
the
circus
pageant
these
people
were
bound
for
the
bazar
with
things
to
sell
we
went
down
there
later
and
saw
that
novel
congress
of
the
wild
peoples
and
plowed
here
and
there
through
it
and
concluded
that
it
would
be
worth
coming
from
calcutta
to
see
even
if
there
were
no
kinchinjunga
and
everest
chapter
lvi
there
are
two
times
in
a
man's
life
when
he
should
not
speculate
when
he
can't
afford
it
and
when
he
can
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
on
monday
and
tuesday
at
sunrise
we
again
had
fair
to
middling
views
of
the
stupendous
mountains
then
being
well
cooled
off
and
refreshed
we
were
ready
to
chance
the
weather
of
the
lower
world
once
more
we
traveled
up
hill
by
the
regular
train
five
miles
to
the
summit
then
changed
to
a
little
canvas
canopied
hand
car
for
the
35
mile
descent
it
was
the
size
of
a
sleigh
it
had
six
seats
and
was
so
low
that
it
seemed
to
rest
on
the
ground
it
had
no
engine
or
other
propelling
power
and
needed
none
to
help
it
fly
down
those
steep
inclines
it
only
needed
a
strong
brake
to
modify
its
flight
and
it
had
that
there
was
a
story
of
a
disastrous
trip
made
down
the
mountain
once
in
this
little
car
by
the
lieutenant
governor
of
bengal
when
the
car
jumped
the
track
and
threw
its
passengers
over
a
precipice
it
was
not
true
but
the
story
had
value
for
me
for
it
made
me
nervous
and
nervousness
wakes
a
person
up
and
makes
him
alive
and
alert
and
heightens
the
thrill
of
a
new
and
doubtful
experience
the
car
could
really
jump
the
track
of
course
a
pebble
on
the
track
placed
there
by
either
accident
or
malice
at
a
sharp
curve
where
one
might
strike
it
before
the
eye
could
discover
it
could
derail
the
car
and
fling
it
down
into
india
and
the
fact
that
the
lieutenant
governor
had
escaped
was
no
proof
that
i
would
have
the
same
luck
and
standing
there
looking
down
upon
the
indian
empire
from
the
airy
altitude
of
7
000
feet
it
seemed
unpleasantly
far
dangerously
far
to
be
flung
from
a
handcar
but
after
all
there
was
but
small
danger
for
me
what
there
was
was
for
mr
pugh
inspector
of
a
division
of
the
indian
police
in
whose
company
and
protection
we
had
come
from
calcutta
he
had
seen
long
service
as
an
artillery
officer
was
less
nervous
than
i
was
and
so
he
was
to
go
ahead
of
us
in
a
pilot
hand
car
with
a
ghurka
and
another
native
and
the
plan
was
that
when
we
should
see
his
car
jump
over
a
precipice
we
must
put
on
our
break
[sp
]
and
send
for
another
pilot
it
was
a
good
arrangement
also
mr
barnard
chief
engineer
of
the
mountain
division
of
the
road
was
to
take
personal
charge
of
our
car
and
he
had
been
down
the
mountain
in
it
many
a
time
everything
looked
safe
indeed
there
was
but
one
questionable
detail
left
the
regular
train
was
to
follow
us
as
soon
as
we
should
start
and
it
might
run
over
us
privately
i
thought
it
would
the
road
fell
sharply
down
in
front
of
us
and
went
corkscrewing
in
and
out
around
the
crags
and
precipices
down
down
forever
down
suggesting
nothing
so
exactly
or
so
uncomfortably
as
a
croaked
toboggan
slide
with
no
end
to
it
mr
pugh
waved
his
flag
and
started
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
and
before
i
could
get
out
of
the
car
we
were
gone
too
i
had
previously
had
but
one
sensation
like
the
shock
of
that
departure
and
that
was
the
gaspy
shock
that
took
my
breath
away
the
first
time
that
i
was
discharged
from
the
summit
of
a
toboggan
slide
but
in
both
instances
the
sensation
was
pleasurable
intensely
so
it
was
a
sudden
and
immense
exaltation
a
mixed
ecstasy
of
deadly
fright
and
unimaginable
joy
i
believe
that
this
combination
makes
the
perfection
of
human
delight
the
pilot
car's
flight
down
the
mountain
suggested
the
swoop
of
a
swallow
that
is
skimming
the
ground
so
swiftly
and
smoothly
and
gracefully
it
swept
down
the
long
straight
reaches
and
soared
in
and
out
of
the
bends
and
around
the
corners
we
raced
after
it
and
seemed
to
flash
by
the
capes
and
crags
with
the
speed
of
light
and
now
and
then
we
almost
overtook
it
and
had
hopes
but
it
was
only
playing
with
us
when
we
got
near
it
released
its
brake
make
a
spring
around
a
corner
and
the
next
time
it
spun
into
view
a
few
seconds
later
it
looked
as
small
as
a
wheelbarrow
it
was
so
far
away
we
played
with
the
train
in
the
same
way
we
often
got
out
to
gather
flowers
or
sit
on
a
precipice
and
look
at
the
scenery
then
presently
we
would
hear
a
dull
and
growing
roar
and
the
long
coils
of
the
train
would
come
into
sight
behind
and
above
us
but
we
did
not
need
to
start
till
the
locomotive
was
close
down
upon
us
then
we
soon
left
it
far
behind
it
had
to
stop
at
every
station
therefore
it
was
not
an
embarrassment
to
us
our
brake
was
a
good
piece
of
machinery
it
could
bring
the
car
to
a
standstill
on
a
slope
as
steep
as
a
house
roof
the
scenery
was
grand
and
varied
and
beautiful
and
there
was
no
hurry
we
could
always
stop
and
examine
it
there
was
abundance
of
time
we
did
not
need
to
hamper
the
train
if
it
wanted
the
road
we
could
switch
off
and
let
it
go
by
then
overtake
it
and
pass
it
later
we
stopped
at
one
place
to
see
the
gladstone
cliff
a
great
crag
which
the
ages
and
the
weather
have
sculptured
into
a
recognizable
portrait
of
the
venerable
statesman
mr
gladstone
is
a
stockholder
in
the
road
and
nature
began
this
portrait
ten
thousand
years
ago
with
the
idea
of
having
the
compliment
ready
in
time
for
the
event
we
saw
a
banyan
tree
which
sent
down
supporting
stems
from
branches
which
were
sixty
feet
above
the
ground
that
is
i
suppose
it
was
a
banyan
its
bark
resembled
that
of
the
great
banyan
in
the
botanical
gardens
at
calcutta
that
spider
legged
thing
with
its
wilderness
of
vegetable
columns
and
there
were
frequent
glimpses
of
a
totally
leafless
tree
upon
whose
innumerable
twigs
and
branches
a
cloud
of
crimson
butterflies
had
lighted
apparently
in
fact
these
brilliant
red
butterflies
were
flowers
but
the
illusion
was
good
afterward
in
south
africa
i
saw
another
splendid
effect
made
by
red
flowers
this
flower
was
probably
called
the
torch
plant
should
have
been
so
named
anyway
it
had
a
slender
stem
several
feet
high
and
from
its
top
stood
up
a
single
tongue
of
flame
an
intensely
red
flower
of
the
size
and
shape
of
a
small
corn
cob
the
stems
stood
three
or
four
feet
apart
all
over
a
great
hill
slope
that
was
a
mile
long
and
make
one
think
of
what
the
place
de
la
concorde
would
be
if
its
myriad
lights
were
red
instead
of
white
and
yellow
a
few
miles
down
the
mountain
we
stopped
half
an
hour
to
see
a
thibetan
dramatic
performance
it
was
in
the
open
air
on
the
hillside
the
audience
was
composed
of
thibetans
ghurkas
and
other
unusual
people
the
costumes
of
the
actors
were
in
the
last
degree
outlandish
and
the
performance
was
in
keeping
with
the
clothes
to
an
accompaniment
of
barbarous
noises
the
actors
stepped
out
one
after
another
and
began
to
spin
around
with
immense
swiftness
and
vigor
and
violence
chanting
the
while
and
soon
the
whole
troupe
would
be
spinning
and
chanting
and
raising
the
dust
they
were
performing
an
ancient
and
celebrated
historical
play
and
a
chinaman
explained
it
to
me
in
pidjin
english
as
it
went
along
the
play
was
obscure
enough
without
the
explanation
with
the
explanation
added
it
was
opake
as
a
drama
this
ancient
historical
work
of
art
was
defective
i
thought
but
as
a
wild
and
barbarous
spectacle
the
representation
was
beyond
criticism
far
down
the
mountain
we
got
out
to
look
at
a
piece
of
remarkable
loop
engineering
a
spiral
where
the
road
curves
upon
itself
with
such
abruptness
that
when
the
regular
train
came
down
and
entered
the
loop
we
stood
over
it
and
saw
the
locomotive
disappear
under
our
bridge
then
in
a
few
moments
appear
again
chasing
its
own
tail
and
we
saw
it
gain
on
it
overtake
it
draw
ahead
past
the
rear
cars
and
run
a
race
with
that
end
of
the
train
it
was
like
a
snake
swallowing
itself
half
way
down
the
mountain
we
stopped
about
an
hour
at
mr
barnard's
house
for
refreshments
and
while
we
were
sitting
on
the
veranda
looking
at
the
distant
panorama
of
hills
through
a
gap
in
the
forest
we
came
very
near
seeing
a
leopard
kill
a
calf
[it
killed
it
the
day
before
]
it
is
a
wild
place
and
lovely
from
the
woods
all
about
came
the
songs
of
birds
among
them
the
contributions
of
a
couple
of
birds
which
i
was
not
then
acquainted
with
the
brain
fever
bird
and
the
coppersmith
the
song
of
the
brain
fever
demon
starts
on
a
low
but
steadily
rising
key
and
is
a
spiral
twist
which
augments
in
intensity
and
severity
with
each
added
spiral
growing
sharper
and
sharper
and
more
and
more
painful
more
and
more
agonizing
more
and
more
maddening
intolerable
unendurable
as
it
bores
deeper
and
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
listener's
brain
until
at
last
the
brain
fever
comes
as
a
relief
and
the
man
dies
i
am
bringing
some
of
these
birds
home
to
america
they
will
be
a
great
curiosity
there
and
it
is
believed
that
in
our
climate
they
will
multiply
like
rabbits
the
coppersmith
bird's
note
at
a
certain
distance
away
has
the
ring
of
a
sledge
on
granite
at
a
certain
other
distance
the
hammering
has
a
more
metallic
ring
and
you
might
think
that
the
bird
was
mending
a
copper
kettle
at
another
distance
it
has
a
more
woodeny
thump
but
it
is
a
thump
that
is
full
of
energy
and
sounds
just
like
starting
a
bung
so
he
is
a
hard
bird
to
name
with
a
single
name
he
is
a
stone
breaker
coppersmith
and
bung
starter
and
even
then
he
is
not
completely
named
for
when
he
is
close
by
you
find
that
there
is
a
soft
deep
melodious
quality
in
his
thump
and
for
that
no
satisfying
name
occurs
to
you
you
will
not
mind
his
other
notes
but
when
he
camps
near
enough
for
you
to
hear
that
one
you
presently
find
that
his
measured
and
monotonous
repetition
of
it
is
beginning
to
disturb
you
next
it
will
weary
you
soon
it
will
distress
you
and
before
long
each
thump
will
hurt
your
head
if
this
goes
on
you
will
lose
your
mind
with
the
pain
and
misery
of
it
and
go
crazy
i
am
bringing
some
of
these
birds
home
to
america
there
is
nothing
like
them
there
they
will
be
a
great
surprise
and
it
is
said
that
in
a
climate
like
ours
they
will
surpass
expectation
for
fecundity
i
am
bringing
some
nightingales
too
and
some
cue
owls
i
got
them
in
italy
the
song
of
the
nightingale
is
the
deadliest
known
to
ornithology
that
demoniacal
shriek
can
kill
at
thirty
yards
the
note
of
the
cue
owl
is
infinitely
soft
and
sweet
soft
and
sweet
as
the
whisper
of
a
flute
but
penetrating
oh
beyond
belief
it
can
bore
through
boiler
iron
it
is
a
lingering
note
and
comes
in
triplets
on
the
one
unchanging
key
hoo
o
o
hoo
o
o
hoo
o
o
then
a
silence
of
fifteen
seconds
then
the
triplet
again
and
so
on
all
night
at
first
it
is
divine
then
less
so
then
trying
then
distressing
then
excruciating
then
agonizing
and
at
the
end
of
two
hours
the
listener
is
a
maniac
and
so
presently
we
took
to
the
hand
car
and
went
flying
down
the
mountain
again
flying
and
stopping
flying
and
stopping
till
at
last
we
were
in
the
plain
once
more
and
stowed
for
calcutta
in
the
regular
train
that
was
the
most
enjoyable
day
i
have
spent
in
the
earth
for
rousing
tingling
rapturous
pleasure
there
is
no
holiday
trip
that
approaches
the
bird
flight
down
the
himalayas
in
a
hand
car
it
has
no
fault
no
blemish
no
lack
except
that
there
are
only
thirty
five
miles
of
it
instead
of
five
hundred
chapter
lvii
she
was
not
quite
what
you
would
call

she
was
not
quite
what
you
would
call

she
was
the
kind
of
person
that

a

pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
judge
nothing
has
been
left
undone
either
by
man
or
nature
to
make
india
the
most
extraordinary
country
that
the
sun
visits
on
his
round
nothing
seems
to
have
been
forgotten
nothing
over
looked
always
when
you
think
you
have
come
to
the
end
of
her
tremendous
specialties
and
have
finished
banging
tags
upon
her
as
the
land
of
the
thug
the
land
of
the
plague
the
land
of
famine
the
land
of
giant
illusions
the
land
of
stupendous
mountains
and
so
forth
another
specialty
crops
up
and
another
tag
is
required
i
have
been
overlooking
the
fact
that
india
is
by
an
unapproachable
supremacy
the
land
of
murderous
wild
creatures
perhaps
it
will
be
simplest
to
throw
away
the
tags
and
generalize
her
with
one
all
comprehensive
name
as
the
land
of
wonders
for
many
years
the
british
indian
government
has
been
trying
to
destroy
the
murderous
wild
creatures
and
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
in
the
effort
the
annual
official
returns
show
that
the
undertaking
is
a
difficult
one
these
returns
exhibit
a
curious
annual
uniformity
in
results
the
sort
of
uniformity
which
you
find
in
the
annual
output
of
suicides
in
the
world's
capitals
and
the
proportions
of
deaths
by
this
that
and
the
other
disease
you
can
always
come
close
to
foretelling
how
many
suicides
will
occur
in
paris
london
and
new
york
next
year
and
also
how
many
deaths
will
result
from
cancer
consumption
dog
bite
falling
out
of
the
window
getting
run
over
by
cabs
etc
if
you
know
the
statistics
of
those
matters
for
the
present
year
in
the
same
way
with
one
year's
indian
statistics
before
you
you
can
guess
closely
at
how
many
people
were
killed
in
that
empire
by
tigers
during
the
previous
year
and
the
year
before
that
and
the
year
before
that
and
at
how
many
were
killed
in
each
of
those
years
by
bears
how
many
by
wolves
and
how
many
by
snakes
and
you
can
also
guess
closely
at
how
many
people
are
going
to
be
killed
each
year
for
the
coming
five
years
by
each
of
those
agencies
you
can
also
guess
closely
at
how
many
of
each
agency
the
government
is
going
to
kill
each
year
for
the
next
five
years
i
have
before
me
statistics
covering
a
period
of
six
consecutive
years
by
these
i
know
that
in
india
the
tiger
kills
something
over
800
persons
every
year
and
that
the
government
responds
by
killing
about
double
as
many
tigers
every
year
in
four
of
the
six
years
referred
to
the
tiger
got
800
odd
in
one
of
the
remaining
two
years
he
got
only
700
but
in
the
other
remaining
year
he
made
his
average
good
by
scoring
917
he
is
always
sure
of
his
average
anyone
who
bets
that
the
tiger
will
kill
2
400
people
in
india
in
any
three
consecutive
years
has
invested
his
money
in
a
certainty
anyone
who
bets
that
he
will
kill
2
600
in
any
three
consecutive
years
is
absolutely
sure
to
lose
as
strikingly
uniform
as
are
the
statistics
of
suicide
they
are
not
any
more
so
than
are
those
of
the
tiger's
annual
output
of
slaughtered
human
beings
in
india
the
government's
work
is
quite
uniform
too
it
about
doubles
the
tiger's
average
in
six
years
the
tiger
killed
5
000
persons
minus
50
in
the
same
six
years
10
000
tigers
were
killed
minus
400
the
wolf
kills
nearly
as
many
people
as
the
tiger
700
a
year
to
the
tiger's
800
odd
but
while
he
is
doing
it
more
than
5
000
of
his
tribe
fall
the
leopard
kills
an
average
of
230
people
per
year
but
loses
3
300
of
his
own
mess
while
he
is
doing
it
the
bear
kills
100
people
per
year
at
a
cost
of
1
250
of
his
own
tribe
the
tiger
as
the
figures
show
makes
a
very
handsome
fight
against
man
but
it
is
nothing
to
the
elephant's
fight
the
king
of
beasts
the
lord
of
the
jungle
loses
four
of
his
mess
per
year
but
he
kills
forty
five
persons
to
make
up
for
it
but
when
it
comes
to
killing
cattle
the
lord
of
the
jungle
is
not
interested
he
kills
but
100
in
six
years
horses
of
hunters
no
doubt
but
in
the
same
six
the
tiger
kills
more
than
84
000
the
leopard
100

for

it
will
be
perceived
that
the

interested

they
kill

the

are

are

anyone

that
in

in

the

in

the

the

kill
17
000
people
a
year
they
hardly
ever
fall
short
of
it
they
as
seldom
exceed
it
an
insurance
actuary
could
take
the
indian
census
tables
and
the
government's
snake
tables
and
tell
you
within
sixpence
how
much
it
would
be
worth
to
insure
a
man
against
death
by
snake
bite
there
if
i
had
a
dollar
for
every
person
killed
per
year
in
india
i
would
rather
have
it
than
any
other
property
as
it
is
the
only
property
in
the
world
not
subject
to
shrinkage
i
should
like
to
have
a
royalty
on
the
government
end
of
the
snake
business
too
and
am
in
london
now
trying
to
get
it
but
when
i
get
it
it
is
not
going
to
be
as
regular
an
income
as
the
other
will
be
if
i
get
that
i
have
applied
for
it
the
snakes
transact
their
end
of
the
business
in
a
more
orderly
and
systematic
way
than
the
government
transacts
its
end
of
it
because
the
snakes
have
had
a
long
experience
and
know
all
about
the
traffic
you
can
make
sure
that
the
government
will
never
kill
fewer
than
110
000
snakes
in
a
year
and
that
it
will
newer
quite
reach
300
000
too
much
room
for
oscillation
good
speculative
stock
to
bear
or
bull
and
buy
and
sell
long
and
short
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
not
eligible
for
investment
like
the
other
the
man
that
speculates
in
the
government's
snake
crop
wants
to
go
carefully
i
would
not
advise
a
man
to
buy
a
single
crop
at
all
i
mean
a
crop
of
futures
for
the
possible
wobble
is
something
quite
extraordinary
if
he
can
buy
six
future
crops
in
a
bunch
seller
to
deliver
1
500
000
altogether
that
is
another
matter
i
do
not
know
what
snakes
are
worth
now
but
i
know
what
they
would
be
worth
then
for
the
statistics
show
that
the
seller
could
not
come
within
427
000
of
carrying
out
his
contract
however
i
think
that
a
person
who
speculates
in
snakes
is
a
fool
anyway
he
always
regrets
it
afterwards
to
finish
the
statistics
in
six
years
the
wild
beasts
kill
20
000
persons
and
the
snakes
kill
103
000
in
the
same
six
the
government
kills
1
073
546
snakes
plenty
left
there
are
narrow
escapes
in
india
in
the
very
jungle
where
i
killed
sixteen
tigers
and
all
those
elephants
a
cobra
bit
me
but
it
got
well
everyone
was
surprised
this
could
not
happen
twice
in
ten
years
perhaps
usually
death
would
result
in
fifteen
minutes
we
struck
out
westward
or
northwestward
from
calcutta
on
an
itinerary
of
a
zig
zag
sort
which
would
in
the
course
of
time
carry
us
across
india
to
its
northwestern
corner
and
the
border
of
afghanistan
the
first
part
of
the
trip
carried
us
through
a
great
region
which
was
an
endless
garden
miles
and
miles
of
the
beautiful
flower
from
whose
juices
comes
the
opium
and
at
muzaffurpore
we
were
in
the
midst
of
the
indigo
culture
thence
by
a
branch
road
to
the
ganges
at
a
point
near
dinapore
and
by
a
train
which
would
have
missed
the
connection
by
a
week
but
for
the
thoughtfulness
of
some
british
officers
who
were
along
and
who
knew
the
ways
of
trains
that
are
run
by
natives
without
white
supervision
this
train
stopped
at
every
village
for
no
purpose
connected
with
business
apparently
we
put
out
nothing
we
took
nothing
aboard
the
train
bands
stepped
ashore
and
gossiped
with
friends
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
pulled
out
and
repeated
this
at
the
succeeding
villages
we
had
thirty
five
miles
to
go
and
six
hours
to
do
it
in
but
it
was
plain
that
we
were
not
going
to
make
it
it
was
then
that
the
english
officers
said
it
was
now
necessary
to
turn
this
gravel
train
into
an
express
so
they
gave
the
engine
driver
a
rupee
and
told
him
to
fly
it
was
a
simple
remedy
after
that
we
made
ninety
miles
an
hour
we
crossed
the
ganges
just
at
dawn
made
our
connection
and
went
to
benares
where
we
stayed
twenty
four
hours
and
inspected
that
strange
and
fascinating
piety
hive
again
then
left
for
lucknow
a
city
which
is
perhaps
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
many
monuments
of
british
fortitude
and
valor
that
are
scattered
about
the
earth
the
heat
was
pitiless
the
flat
plains
were
destitute
of
grass
and
baked
dry
by
the
sun
they
were
the
color
of
pale
dust
which
was
flying
in
clouds
but
it
was
much
hotter
than
this
when
the
relieving
forces
marched
to
lucknow
in
the
time
of
the
mutiny
those
were
the
days
of
138

without

pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
it
seems
to
be
settled
now
that
among
the
many
causes
from
which
the
great
mutiny
sprang
the
main
one
was
the
annexation
of
the
kingdom
of
oudh
by
the
east
india
company
characterized
by
sir
henry
lawrence
as
the
most
unrighteous
act
that
was
ever
committed
in
the
spring
of
1857
a
mutinous
spirit
was
observable
in
many
of
the
native
garrisons
and
it
grew
day
by
day
and
spread
wider
and
wider
the
younger
military
men
saw
something
very
serious
in
it
and
would
have
liked
to
take
hold
of
it
vigorously
and
stamp
it
out
promptly
but
they
were
not
in
authority
old
men
were
in
the
high
places
of
the
army
men
who
should
have
been
retired
long
before
because
of
their
great
age
and
they
regarded
the
matter
as
a
thing
of
no
consequence
they
loved
their
native
soldiers
and
would
not
believe
that
anything
could
move
them
to
revolt
everywhere
these
obstinate
veterans
listened
serenely
to
the
rumbling
of
the
volcanoes
under
them
and
said
it
was
nothing
and
so
the
propagators
of
mutiny
had
everything
their
own
way
they
moved
from
camp
to
camp
undisturbed
and
painted
to
the
native
soldier
the
wrongs
his
people
were
suffering
at
the
hands
of
the
english
and
made
his
heart
burn
for
revenge
they
were
able
to
point
to
two
facts
of
formidable
value
as
backers
of
their
persuasions
in
clive's
day
native
armies
were
incoherent
mobs
and
without
effective
arms
therefore
they
were
weak
against
clive's
organized
handful
of
well
armed
men
but
the
thing
was
the
other
way
now
the
british
forces
were
native
they
had
been
trained
by
the
british
organized
by
the
british
armed
by
the
british
all
the
power
was
in
their
hands
they
were
a
club
made
by
british
hands
to
beat
out
british
brains
with
there
was
nothing
to
oppose
their
mass
nothing
but
a
few
weak
battalions
of
british
soldiers
scattered
about
india
a
force
not
worth
speaking
of
this
argument
taken
alone
might
not
have
succeeded
for
the
bravest
and
best
indian
troops
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
the
white
soldier
whether
he
was
weak
or
strong
but
the
agitators
backed
it
with
their
second
and
best
point
prophecy
a
prophecy
a
hundred
years
old
the
indian
is
open
to
prophecy
at
all
times
argument
may
fail
to
convince
him
but
not
prophecy
there
was
a
prophecy
that
a
hundred
years
from
the
year
of
that
battle
of
clive's
which
founded
the
british
indian
empire
the
british
power
would
be
overthrown
and
swept
away
by
the
natives
the
mutiny
broke
out
at
meerut
on
the
10th
of
may
1857
and
fired
a
train
of
tremendous
historical
explosions
nana
sahib's
massacre
of
the
surrendered
garrison
of
cawnpore
occurred
in
june
and
the
long
siege
of
lucknow
began
the
military
history
of
england
is
old
and
great
but
i
think
it
must
be
granted
that
the
crushing
of
the
mutiny
is
the
greatest
chapter
in
it
the
british
were
caught
asleep
and
unprepared
they
were
a
few
thousands
swallowed
up
in
an
ocean
of
hostile
populations
it
would
take
months
to
inform
england
and
get
help
but
they
did
not
falter
or
stop
to
count
the
odds
but
with
english
resolution
and
english
devotion
they
took
up
their
task
and
went
stubbornly
on
with
it
through
good
fortune
and
bad
and
fought
the
most
unpromising
fight
that
one
may
read
of
in
fiction
or
out
of
it
and
won
it
thoroughly
the
mutiny
broke
out
so
suddenly
and
spread
with
such
rapidity
that
there
was
but
little
time
for
occupants
of
weak
outlying
stations
to
escape
to
places
of
safety
attempts
were
made
of
course
but
they
were
attended
by
hardships
as
bitter
as
death
in
the
few
cases
which
were
successful
for
the
heat
ranged
between
120
and
138
in
the
shade
the
way
led
through
hostile
peoples
and
food
and
water
were
hardly
to
be
had
for
ladies
and
children
accustomed
to
ease
and
comfort
and
plenty
such
a
journey
must
have
been
a
cruel
experience
sir
g
o
trevelyan
quotes
an
example
this
is
what
befell
mrs
m
the
wife
of
the
surgeon
at
a
certain
station
on
the
southern
confines
of
the
insurrection
'i
heard
'
she
says
'a
number
of
shots
fired
and
looking
out
i
saw
my
husband
driving
furiously
from
the
mess
house
waving
his
whip
i
ran
to
him
and
seeing
a
bearer
with
my
child
in
his
arms
i
caught
her
up
and
got
into
the
buggy
at
the
mess
house
we
found
all
the
officers
assembled
together
with
sixty
sepoys
who
had
remained
faithful
we
went
off
in
one
large
party
amidst
a
general
conflagration
of
our
late
homes
we
reached
the
caravanserai
at
chattapore
the
next
morning
and
thence
started
for
callinger
at
this
point
our
sepoy
escort
deserted
us
we
were
fired
upon
by
match
lockmen
and
one
officer
was
shot
dead
we
heard
likewise
that
the
people
had
risen
at
callinger
so
we
returned
and
walked
back
ten
miles
that
day
m
and
i
carried
the
child
alternately
presently
mrs
smalley
died
of
sunstroke
we
had
no
food
amongst
us
an
officer
kindly
lent
us
a
horse
we
were
very
faint
the
major
died
and
was
buried
also
the
sergeant
major
and
some
women
the
bandsmen
left
us
on
the
nineteenth
of
june
we
were
fired
at
again
by
match
lockmen
and
changed
direction
for
allahabad
our
party
consisted
of
nine
gentlemen
two
children
the
sergeant
and
his
wife
on
the
morning
of
the
twentieth
captain
scott
took
lottie
on
to
his
horse
i
was
riding
behind
my
husband
and
she
was
so
crushed
between
us
she
was
two
years
old
on
the
first
of
the
month
we
were
both
weak
through
want
of
food
and
the
effect
of
the
sun
lottie
and
i
had
no
head
covering
m
had
a
sepoy's
cap
i
found
on
the
ground
soon
after
sunrise
we
were
followed
by
villagers
armed
with
clubs
and
spears
one
of
them
struck
captain
scott's
horse
on
the
leg
he
galloped
off
with
lottie
and
my
poor
husband
never
saw
his
child
again
we
rode
on
several
miles
keeping
away
from
villages
and
then
crossed
the
river
our
thirst
was
extreme
m
had
dreadful
cramps
so
that
i
had
to
hold
him
on
the
horse
i
was
very
uneasy
about
him
the
day
before
i
saw
the
drummer's
wife
eating
chupatties
and
asked
her
to
give
a
piece
to
the
child
which
she
did
i
now
saw
water
in
a
ravine
the
descent
was
steep
and
our
only
drinkingvessel
was
m
's
cap
our
horse
got
water
and
i
bathed
my
neck
i
had
no
stockings
and
my
feet
were
torn
and
blistered
two
peasants
came
in
sight
and
we
were
frightened
and
rode
off
the
sergeant
held
our
horse
and
m
put
me
up
and
mounted
i
think
he
must
have
got
suddenly
faint
for
i
fell
and
he
over
me
on
the
road
when
the
horse
started
off
some
time
before
he
said
and
barber
too
that
he
could
not
live
many
hours
i
felt
he
was
dying
before
we
came
to
the
ravine
he
told
me
his
wishes
about
his
children
and
myself
and
took
leave
my
brain
seemed
burnt
up
no
tears
came
as
soon
as
we
fell
the
sergeant
let
go
the
horse
and
it
went
off
so
that
escape
was
cut
off
we
sat
down
on
the
ground
waiting
for
death
poor
fellow!
he
was
very
weak
his
thirst
was
frightful
and
i
went
to
get
him
water
some
villagers
came
and
took
my
rupees
and
watch
i
took
off
my
wedding
ring
and
twisted
it
in
my
hair
and
replaced
the
guard
i
tore
off
the
skirt
of
my
dress
to
bring
water
in
but
was
no
use
for
when
i
returned
my
beloved's
eyes
were
fixed
and
though
i
called
and
tried
to
restore
him
and
poured
water
into
his
mouth
it
only
rattled
in
his
throat
he
never
spoke
to
me
again
i
held
him
in
my
arms
till
he
sank
gradually
down
i
felt
frantic
but
could
not
cry
i
was
alone
i
bound
his
head
and
face
in
my
dress
for
there
was
no
earth
to
buy
him
the
pain
in
my
hands
and
feet
was
dreadful
i
went
down
to
the
ravine
and
sat
in
the
water
on
a
stone
hoping
to
get
off
at
night
and
look
for
lottie
when
i
came
back
from
the
water
i
saw
that
they
had
not
taken
her
little
watch
chain
and
seals
so
i
tied
them
under
my
petticoat
in
an
hour
about
thirty
villagers
came
they
dragged
me
out
of
the
ravine
and
took
off
my
jacket
and
found
the
little
chain
they
then
dragged
me
to
a
village
mocking
me
all
the
way
and
disputing
as
to
whom
i
was
to
belong
to
the
whole
population
came
to
look
at
me
i
asked
for
a
bedstead
and
lay
down
outside
the
door
of
a
hut
they
had
a
dozen
of
cows
and
yet
refused
me
milk
when
night
came
and
the
village
was
quiet
some
old
woman
brought
me
a
leafful
of
rice
i
was
too
parched
to
eat
and
they
gave
me
water
the
morning
after
a
neighboring
rajah
sent
a
palanquin
and
a
horseman
to
fetch
me
who
told
me
that
a
little
child
and
three
sahibs
had
come
to
his
master's
house
and
so
the
poor
mother
found
her
lost
one
'greatly
blistered
'
poor
little
creature
it
is
not
for
europeans
in
india
to
pray
that
their
flight
be
not
in
the
winter
in
the
first
days
of
june
the
aged
general
sir
hugh
wheeler
commanding
the
forces
at
cawnpore
was
deserted
by
his
native
troops
then
he
moved
out
of
the
fort
and
into
an
exposed
patch
of
open
flat
ground
and
built
a
four
foot
mud
wall
around
it
he
had
with
him
a
few
hundred
white
soldiers
and
officers
and
apparently
more
women
and
children
than
soldiers
he
was
short
of
provisions
short
of
arms
short
of
ammunition
short
of
military
wisdom
short
of
everything
but
courage
and
devotion
to
duty
the
defense
of
that
open
lot
through
twenty
one
days
and
nights
of
hunger
thirst
indian
heat
and
a
never
ceasing
storm
of
bullets
bombs
and
cannon
balls
a
defense
conducted
not
by
the
aged
and
infirm
general
but
by
a
young
officer
named
moore
is
one
of
the
most
heroic
episodes
in
history
when
at
last
the
nana
found
it
impossible
to
conquer
these
starving
men
and
women
with
powder
and
ball
he
resorted
to
treachery
and
that
succeeded
he
agreed
to
supply
them
with
food
and
send
them
to
allahabad
in
boats
their
mud
wall
and
their
barracks
were
in
ruins
their
provisions
were
at
the
point
of
exhaustion
they
had
done
all
that
the
brave
could
do
they
had
conquered
an
honorable
compromise
their
forces
had
been
fearfully
reduced
by
casualties
and
by
disease
they
were
not
able
to
continue
the
contest
longer
they
came
forth
helpless
but
suspecting
no
treachery
the
nana's
host
closed
around
them
and
at
a
signal
from
a
trumpet
the
massacre
began
about
two
hundred
women
and
children
were
spared
for
the
present
but
all
the
men
except
three
or
four
were
killed
among
the
incidents
of
the
massacre
quoted
by
sir
g
o
trevelyan
is
this
when
after
the
lapse
of
some
twenty
minutes
the
dead
began
to
outnumber
the
living
when
the
fire
slackened
as
the
marks
grew
few
and
far
between
then
the
troopers
who
had
been
drawn
up
to
the
right
of
the
temple
plunged
into
the
river
sabre
between
teeth
and
pistol
in
hand
thereupon
two
half
caste
christian
women
the
wives
of
musicians
in
the
band
of
the
fifty
sixth
witnessed
a
scene
which
should
not
be
related
at
second
hand
'in
the
boat
where
i
was
to
have
gone
'
says
mrs
bradshaw
confirmed
throughout
by
mrs
betts
'was
the
school
mistress
and
twenty
two
misses
general
wheeler
came
last
in
a
palkee
they
carried
him
into
the
water
near
the
boat
i
stood
close
by
he
said
'carry
me
a
little
further
towards
the
boat
'
but
a
trooper
said
'no
get
out
here
'
as
the
general
got
out
of
the
palkee
head
foremost
the
trooper
gave
him
a
cut
with
his
sword
into
the
neck
and
he
fell
into
the
water
my
son
was
killed
near
him
i
saw
it
alas!
alas!
some
were
stabbed
with
bayonets
others
cut
down
little
infants
were
torn
in
pieces
we
saw
it
we
did
and
tell
you
only
what
we
saw
other
children
were
stabbed
and
thrown
into
the
river
the
schoolgirls
were
burnt
to
death
i
saw
their
clothes
and
hair
catch
fire
in
the
water
a
few
paces
off
by
the
next
boat
we
saw
the
youngest
daughter
of
colonel
williams
a
sepoy
was
going
to
kill
her
with
his
bayonet
she
said
'my
father
was
always
kind
to
sepoys
'
he
turned
away
and
just
then
a
villager
struck
her
on
the
head
with
a
club
and
she
fell
into
the
water
these
people
likewise
saw
good
mr
moncrieff
the
clergyman
take
a
book
from
his
pocket
that
he
never
had
leisure
to
open
and
heard
him
commence
a
prayer
for
mercy
which
he
was
not
permitted
to
conclude
another
deponent
observed
an
european
making
for
a
drain
like
a
scared
water
rat
when
some
boatmen
armed
with
cudgels
cut
off
his
retreat
and
beat
him
down
dead
into
the
mud
the
women
and
children
who
had
been
reserved
from
the
massacre
were
imprisoned
during
a
fortnight
in
a
small
building
one
story
high
a
cramped
place
a
slightly
modified
black
hole
of
calcutta
they
were
waiting
in
suspense
there
was
none
who
could
foretaste
their
fate
meantime
the
news
of
the
massacre
had
traveled
far
and
an
army
of
rescuers
with
havelock
at
its
head
was
on
its
way
at
least
an
army
which
hoped
to
be
rescuers
it
was
crossing
the
country
by
forced
marches
and
strewing
its
way
with
its
own
dead
men
struck
down
by
cholera
and
by
a
heat
which
reached
135
deg
it
was
in
a
vengeful
fury
and
it
stopped
for
nothing
neither
heat
nor
fatigue
nor
disease
nor
human
opposition
it
tore
its
impetuous
way
through
hostile
forces
winning
victory
after
victory
but
still
striding
on
and
on
not
halting
to
count
results
and
at
last
after
this
extraordinary
march
it
arrived
before
the
walls
of
cawnpore
met
the
nana's
massed
strength
delivered
a
crushing
defeat
and
entered
but
too
late
only
a
few
hours
too
late
for
at
the
last
moment
the
nana
had
decided
upon
the
massacre
of
the
captive
women
and
children
and
had
commissioned
three
mohammedans
and
two
hindoos
to
do
the
work
sir
g
o
trevelyan
says
thereupon
the
five
men
entered
it
was
the
short
gloaming
of
hindostan
the
hour
when
ladies
take
their
evening
drive
she
who
had
accosted
the
officer
was
standing
in
the
doorway
with
her
were
the
native
doctor
and
two
hindoo
menials
that
much
of
the
business
might
be
seen
from
the
veranda
but
all
else
was
concealed
amidst
the
interior
gloom
shrieks
and
scuffing
acquainted
those
without
that
the
journeymen
were
earning
their
hire
survur
khan
soon
emerged
with
his
sword
broken
off
at
the
hilt
he
procured
another
from
the
nana's
house
and
a
few
minutes
after
appeared
again
on
the
same
errand
the
third
blade
was
of
better
temper
or
perhaps
the
thick
of
the
work
was
already
over
by
the
time
darkness
had
closed
in
the
men
came
forth
and
locked
up
the
house
for
the
night
then
the
screams
ceased
but
the
groans
lasted
till
morning
the
sun
rose
as
usual
when
he
had
been
up
nearly
three
hours
the
five
repaired
to
the
scene
of
their
labors
over
night
they
were
attended
by
a
few
sweepers
who
proceeded
to
transfer
the
contents
of
the
house
to
a
dry
well
situated
behind
some
trees
which
grew
hard
by
'the
bodies
'
says
one
who
was
present
throughout
'were
dragged
out
most
of
them
by
the
hair
of
the
head
those
who
had
clothing
worth
taking
were
stripped
some
of
the
women
were
alive
i
cannot
say
how
many
but
three
could
speak
they
prayed
for
the
sake
of
god
that
an
end
might
be
put
to
their
sufferings
i
remarked
one
very
stout
woman
a
half
caste
who
was
severely
wounded
in
both
arms
who
entreated
to
be
killed
she
and
two
or
three
others
were
placed
against
the
bank
of
the
cut
by
which
bullocks
go
down
in
drawing
water
the
dead
were
first
thrown
in
yes
there
was
a
great
crowd
looking
on
they
were
standing
along
the
walls
of
the
compound
they
were
principally
city
people
and
villagers
yes
there
were
also
sepoys
three
boys
were
alive
they
were
fair
children
the
eldest
i
think
must
have
been
six
or
seven
and
the
youngest
five
years
they
were
running
around
the
well
where
else
could
they
go
to
and
there
was
none
to
save
them
no
one
said
a
word
or
tried
to
save
them
'
at
length
the
smallest
of
them
made
an
infantile
attempt
to
get
away
the
little
thing
had
been
frightened
past
bearing
by
the
murder
of
one
of
the
surviving
ladies
he
thus
attracted
the
observation
of
a
native
who
flung
him
and
his
companions
down
the
well
the
soldiers
had
made
a
march
of
eighteen
days
almost
without
rest
to
save
the
women
and
the
children
and
now
they
were
too
late
all
were
dead
and
the
assassin
had
flown
what
happened
then
trevelyan
hesitated
to
put
into
words
of
what
took
place
the
less
said
is
the
better
then
he
continues
but
there
was
a
spectacle
to
witness
which
might
excuse
much
those
who
straight
from
the
contested
field
wandered
sobbing
through
the
rooms
of
the
ladies'
house
saw
what
it
were
well
could
the
outraged
earth
have
straightway
hidden
the
inner
apartment
was
ankle
deep
in
blood
the
plaster
was
scored
with
sword
cuts
not
high
up
as
where
men
have
fought
but
low
down
and
about
the
corners
as
if
a
creature
had
crouched
to
avoid
the
blow
strips
of
dresses
vainly
tied
around
the
handles
of
the
doors
signified
the
contrivance
to
which
feminine
despair
had
resorted
as
a
means
of
keeping
out
the
murderers
broken
combs
were
there
and
the
frills
of
children's
trousers
and
torn
cuffs
and
pinafores
and
little
round
hats
and
one
or
two
shoes
with
burst
latchets
and
one
or
two
daguerreotype
cases
with
cracked
glasses
an
officer
picked
up
a
few
curls
preserved
in
a
bit
of
cardboard
and
marked
'ned's
hair
with
love'
but
around
were
strewn
locks
some
near
a
yard
in
length
dissevered
not
as
a
keepsake
by
quite
other
scissors
the
battle
of
waterloo
was
fought
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
i
do
not
state
this
fact
as
a
reminder
to
the
reader
but
as
news
to
him
for
a
forgotten
fact
is
news
when
it
comes
again
writers
of
books
have
the
fashion
of
whizzing
by
vast
and
renowned
historical
events
with
the
remark
the
details
of
this
tremendous
episode
are
too
familiar
to
the
reader
to
need
repeating
here
they
know
that
that
is
not
true
it
is
a
low
kind
of
flattery
they
know
that
the
reader
has
forgotten
every
detail
of
it
and
that
nothing
of
the
tremendous
event
is
left
in
his
mind
but
a
vague
and
formless
luminous
smudge
aside
from
the
desire
to
flatter
the
reader
they
have
another
reason
for
making
the
remark
two
reasons
indeed
they
do
not
remember
the
details
themselves
and
do
not
want
the
trouble
of
hunting
them
up
and
copying
them
out
also
they
are
afraid
that
if
they
search
them
out
and
print
them
they
will
be
scoffed
at
by
the
book
reviewers
for
retelling
those
worn
old
things
which
are
familiar
to
everybody
they
should
not
mind
the
reviewer's
jeer
he
doesn't
remember
any
of
the
worn
old
things
until
the
book
which
he
is
reviewing
has
retold
them
to
him
i
have
made
the
quoted
remark
myself
at
one
time
and
another
but
i
was
not
doing
it
to
flatter
the
reader
i
was
merely
doing
it
to
save
work
if
i
had
known
the
details
without
brushing
up
i
would
have
put
them
in
but
i
didn't
and
i
did
not
want
the
labor
of
posting
myself
so
i
said
the
details
of
this
tremendous
episode
are
too
familiar
to
the
reader
to
need
repeating
here
i
do
not
like
that
kind
of
a
lie
still
it
does
save
work
i
am
not
trying
to
get
out
of
repeating
the
details
of
the
siege
of
lucknow
in
fear
of
the
reviewer
i
am
not
leaving
them
out
in
fear
that
they
would
not
interest
the
reader
i
am
leaving
them
out
partly
to
save
work
mainly
for
lack
of
room
it
is
a
pity
too
for
there
is
not
a
dull
place
anywhere
in
the
great
story
ten
days
before
the
outbreak
may
10th
of
the
mutiny
all
was
serene
at
lucknow
the
huge
capital
of
oudh
the
kingdom
which
had
recently
been
seized
by
the
india
company
there
was
a
great
garrison
composed
of
about
7
000
native
troops
and
between
700
and
800
whites
these
white
soldiers
and
their
families
were
probably
the
only
people
of
their
race
there
at
their
elbow
was
that
swarming
population
of
warlike
natives
a
race
of
born
soldiers
brave
daring
and
fond
of
fighting
on
high
ground
just
outside
the
city
stood
the
palace
of
that
great
personage
the
resident
the
representative
of
british
power
and
authority
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
spacious
grounds
with
its
due
complement
of
outbuildings
and
the
grounds
were
enclosed
by
a
wall
a
wall
not
for
defense
but
for
privacy
the
mutinous
spirit
was
in
the
air
but
the
whites
were
not
afraid
and
did
not
feel
much
troubled
then
came
the
outbreak
at
meerut
then
the
capture
of
delhi
by
the
mutineers
in
june
came
the
three
weeks
leaguer
of
sir
hugh
wheeler
in
his
open
lot
at
cawnpore
40
miles
distant
from
lucknow
then
the
treacherous
massacre
of
that
gallant
little
garrison
and
now
the
great
revolt
was
in
full
flower
and
the
comfortable
condition
of
things
at
lucknow
was
instantly
changed
there
was
an
outbreak
there
and
sir
henry
lawrence
marched
out
of
the
residency
on
the
30th
of
june
to
put
it
down
but
was
defeated
with
heavy
loss
and
had
difficulty
in
getting
back
again
that
night
the
memorable
siege
of
the
residency
called
the
siege
of
lucknow
began
sir
henry
was
killed
three
days
later
and
brigadier
inglis
succeeded
him
in
command
outside
of
the
residency
fence
was
an
immense
host
of
hostile
and
confident
native
besiegers
inside
it
were
480
loyal
native
soldiers
730
white
ones
and
500
women
and
children
in
those
days
the
english
garrisons
always
managed
to
hamper
themselves
sufficiently
with
women
and
children
the
natives
established
themselves
in
houses
close
at
hand
and
began
to
rain
bullets
and
cannon
balls
into
the
residency
and
this
they
kept
up
night
and
day
during
four
months
and
a
half
the
little
garrison
industriously
replying
all
the
time
the
women
and
children
soon
became
so
used
to
the
roar
of
the
guns
that
it
ceased
to
disturb
their
sleep
the
children
imitated
siege
and
defense
in
their
play
the
women
with
any
pretext
or
with
none
would
sally
out
into
the
storm
swept
grounds
the
defense
was
kept
up
week
after
week
with
stubborn
fortitude
in
the
midst
of
death
which
came
in
many
forms
by
bullet
small
pox
cholera
and
by
various
diseases
induced
by
unpalatable
and
insufficient
food
by
the
long
hours
of
wearying
and
exhausting
overwork
in
the
daily
and
nightly
battle
in
the
oppressive
indian
heat
and
by
the
broken
rest
caused
by
the
intolerable
pest
of
mosquitoes
flies
mice
rats
and
fleas
six
weeks
after
the
beginning
of
the
siege
more
than
one
half
of
the
original
force
of
white
soldiers
was
dead
and
close
upon
three
fifths
of
the
original
native
force
but
the
fighting
went
on
just
the
same
the
enemy
mined
the
english
counter
mined
and
turn
about
they
blew
up
each
other's
posts
the
residency
grounds
were
honey
combed
with
the
enemy's
tunnels
deadly
courtesies
were
constantly
exchanged
sorties
by
the
english
in
the
night
rushes
by
the
enemy
in
the
night
rushes
whose
purpose
was
to
breach
the
walls
or
scale
them
rushes
which
cost
heavily
and
always
failed
the
ladies
got
used
to
all
the
horrors
of
war
the
shrieks
of
mutilated
men
the
sight
of
blood
and
death
lady
inglis
makes
this
mention
in
her
diary
mrs
bruere's
nurse
was
carried
past
our
door
to
day
wounded
in
the
eye
to
extract
the
bullet
it
was
found
necessary
to
take
out
the
eye
a
fearful
operation
her
mistress
held
her
while
it
was
performed
the
first
relieving
force
failed
to
relieve
it
was
under
havelock
and
outram
and
arrived
when
the
siege
had
been
going
on
for
three
months
it
fought
its
desperate
way
to
lucknow
then
fought
its
way
through
the
city
against
odds
of
a
hundred
to
one
and
entered
the
residency
but
there
was
not
enough
left
of
it
then
to
do
any
good
it
lost
more
men
in
its
last
fight
than

found
in
the
residency
when
it
got
in
it
became
captive
itself
the
fighting
and
starving
and
dying
by
bullets
and
disease
went
steadily
on
both
sides
fought
with
energy
and
industry
captain
birch
puts
this
striking
incident
in
evidence
he
is
speaking
of
the
third
month
of
the
siege
as
an
instance
of
the
heavy
firing
brought
to
bear
on
our
position
this
month
may
be
mentioned
the
cutting
down
of
the
upper
story
of
a
brick
building
simply
by
musketry
firring
this
building
was
in
a
most
exposed
position
all
the
shots
which
just
missed
the
top
of
the
rampart
cut
into
the
dead
wall
pretty
much
in
a
straight
line
and
at
length
cut
right
through
and
brought
the
upper
story
tumbling
down
the
upper
structure
on
the
top
of
the
brigade
mess
also
fell
in
the
residency
house
was
a
wreck
captain
anderson's
post
had
long
ago
been
knocked
down
and
innes'
post
also
fell
in
these
two
were
riddled
with
round
shot
as
many
as
200
were
picked
up
by
colonel
masters
the
exhausted
garrison
fought
doggedly
on
all
through
the
next
month

news
came
sir
colin
campbell's
relieving
force
would
soon
be
on
its
way
from
cawnpore
on
the
12th
the
boom
of
his
guns
was
heard
on
the
13th
the
sounds
came
nearer
he
was
slowly
but
steadily
cutting
his
way
through
storming
one
stronghold
after
another
on
the
14th
he
captured
the
martiniere
college
and
ran
up
the
british
flag
there
it
was
seen
from
the
residency
next
he
took
the
dilkoosha
on
the
17th
he
took
the
former
mess
house
of
the
32d
regiment
a
fortified
building
and
very
strong
a
most
exciting
anxious
day
writes
lady
inglis
in
her
diary
about
4
p
m
two
strange
officers
walked
through
our
yard
leading
their
horses
and
by
that
sign
she
knew
that
communication
was
established
between
the
forces
that
the
relief
was
real
this
time
and
that
the
long
siege
of
lucknow
was
ended
the
last
eight
or
ten
miles
of
sir
colin
campbell's
march
was
through
seas
of
blood
the
weapon
mainly
used
was
the
bayonet
the
fighting
was
desperate
the
way
was
mile
stoned
with
detached
strong
buildings
of
stone
fortified
and
heavily
garrisoned
and
these
had
to
be
taken
by
assault
neither
side
asked
for
quarter
and
neither
gave
it
at
the
secundrabagh
where
nearly
two
thousand
of
the
enemy
occupied
a
great
stone
house
in
a
garden
the
work
of
slaughter
was
continued
until
every
man
was
killed
that
is
a
sample
of
the
character
of
that
devastating
march
there
were
but
few
trees
in
the
plain
at
that
time
and
from
the
residency
the
progress
of
the
march
step
by
step
victory
by
victory
could
be
noted
the
ascending
clouds
of
battle
smoke
marked
the
way
to
the
eye
and
the
thunder
of
the
guns
marked
it
to
the
ear
sir
colin
campbell
had
not
come
to
lucknow
to
hold
it
but
to
save
the
occupants
of
the
residency
and
bring
them
away
four
or
five
days
after
his
arrival
the
secret
evacuation
by
the
troops
took
place
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
night
by
the
principal
gate
the
bailie
guard
the
two
hundred
women
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
children
had
been
previously
removed
captain
birch
says
and
now
commenced
a
movement
of
the
most
perfect
arrangement
and
successful
generalship
the
withdrawal
of
the
whole
of
the
various
forces
a
combined
movement
requiring
the
greatest
care
and
skill
first
the
garrison
in
immediate
contact
with
the
enemy
at
the
furthest
extremity
of
the
residency
position
was
marched
out
every
other
garrison
in
turn
fell
in
behind
it
and
so
passed
out
through
the
bailie
guard
gate
till
the
whole
of
our
position
was
evacuated
then
havelock's
force
was
similarly
withdrawn
post
by
post
marching
in
rear
of
our
garrison
after
them
in
turn
came
the
forces
of
the
commander
in
chief
which
joined
on
in
the
rear
of
havelock's
force
regiment
by
regiment
was
withdrawn
with
the
utmost
order
and
regularity
the
whole
operation
resembled
the
movement
of
a
telescope
stern
silence
was
kept
and
the
enemy
took
no
alarm
lady
inglis
referring
to
her
husband
and
to
general
sir
james
outram
sets
down
the
closing
detail
of
this
impressive
midnight
retreat
in
darkness
and
by
stealth
of
this
shadowy
host
through
the
gate
which
it
had
defended
so
long
and
so
well
at
twelve
precisely
they
marched
out
john
and
sir
james
outram
remaining
till
all
had
passed
and
then
they
took
off
their
hats
to
the
bailie
guard
the
scene
of
as
noble
a
defense
as
i
think
history
will
ever
have
to
relate
chapter
lix
don't
part
with
your
illusions
when
they
are
gone
you
may
still
exist
but
you
have
ceased
to
live
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
often
the
surest
way
to
convey
misinformation
is
to
tell
the
strict
truth
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
we
were
driven
over
sir
colin
campbell's
route
by
a
british
officer
and
when
i
arrived
at
the
residency
i
was
so
familiar
with
the
road
that
i
could
have
led
a
retreat
over
it
myself
but
the
compass
in
my
head
has
been
out
of
order
from
my
birth
and
so
as
soon
as
i
was
within
the
battered
bailie
guard
and
turned
about
to
review
the
march
and
imagine
the
relieving
forces
storming
their
way
along
it
everything
was
upside
down
and
wrong
end
first
in
a
moment
and
i
was
never
able
to
get
straightened
out
again
and
now
when
i
look
at
the
battle
plan
the
confusion
remains
in
me
the
east
was
born
west
the
battle
plans
which
have
the
east
on
the
right
hand
side
are
of
no
use
to
me
the
residency
ruins
are
draped
with
flowering
vines
and
are
impressive
and
beautiful
they
and
the
grounds
are
sacred
now
and
will
suffer
no
neglect
nor
be
profaned
by
any
sordid
or
commercial
use
while
the
british
remain
masters
of
india
within
the
grounds
are
buried
the
dead
who
gave
up
their
lives
there
in
the
long
siege
after
a
fashion
i
was
able
to
imagine
the
fiery
storm
that
raged
night
and
day
over
the
place
during
so
many
months
and
after
a
fashion
i
could
imagine
the
men
moving
through
it
but
i
could
not
satisfactorily
place
the
200
women
and
i
could
do
nothing
at
all
with
the
250
children
i
knew
by
lady
inglis'
diary
that
the
children
carried
on
their
small
affairs
very
much
as
if
blood
and
carnage
and
the
crash
and
thunder
of
a
siege
were
natural
and
proper
features
of
nursery
life
and
i
tried
to
realize
it
but
when
her
little
johnny
came
rushing
all
excitement
through
the
din
and
smoke
shouting
oh
mamma
the
white
hen
has
laid
an
egg!
i
saw
that
i
could
not
do
it
johnny's
place
was
under
the
bed
i
could
imagine
him
there
because
i
could
imagine
myself
there
and
i
think
i
should
not
have
been
interested
in
a
hen
that
was
laying
an
egg
my
interest
would
have
been
with
the
parties
that
were
laying
the
bombshells
i
sat
at
dinner
with
one
of
those
children
in
the
club's
indian
palace
and
i
knew
that
all
through
the
siege
he
was
perfecting
his
teething
and
learning
to
talk
and
while
to
me
he
was
the
most
impressive
object
in
lucknow
after
the
residency
ruins
i
was
not
able
to
imagine
what
his
life
had
been
during
that
tempestuous
infancy
of
his
nor
what
sort
of
a
curious
surprise
it
must
have
been
to
him
to
be
marched
suddenly
out
into
a
strange
dumb
world
where
there
wasn't
any
noise
and
nothing
going
on
he
was
only
forty
one
when
i
saw
him
a
strangely
youthful
link
to
connect
the
present
with
so
ancient
an
episode
as
the
great
mutiny
by
and
by
we
saw
cawnpore
and
the
open
lot
which
was
the
scene
of
moore's
memorable
defense
and
the
spot
on
the
shore
of
the
ganges
where
the
massacre
of
the
betrayed
garrison
occurred
and
the
small
indian
temple
whence
the
bugle
signal
notified
the
assassins
to
fall
on
this
latter
was
a
lonely
spot
and
silent
the
sluggish
river
drifted
by
almost
currentless
it
was
dead
low
water
narrow
channels
with
vast
sandbars
between
all
the
way
across
the
wide
bed
and
the
only
living
thing
in
sight
was
that
grotesque
and
solemn
bald
headed
bird
the
adjutant
standing
on
his
six
foot
stilts
solitary
on
a
distant
bar
with
his
head
sunk
between
his
shoulders
thinking
thinking
of
his
prize
i
suppose
the
dead
hindoo
that
lay
awash
at
his
feet
and
whether
to
eat
him
alone
or
invite
friends
he
and
his
prey
were
a
proper
accent
to
that
mournful
place
they
were
in
keeping
with
it
they
emphasized
its
loneliness
and
its
solemnity
and
we
saw
the
scene
of
the
slaughter
of
the
helpless
women
and
children
and
also
the
costly
memorial
that
is
built
over
the
well
which
contains
their
remains
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
is
gone
but
a
more
reverent
age
is
come
and
whatever
remembrancer
still
exists
of
the
moving
and
heroic
sufferings
and
achievements
of
the
garrisons
of
lucknow
and
cawnpore
will
be
guarded
and
preserved
in
agra
and
its
neighborhood
and
afterwards
at
delhi
we
saw
forts
mosques
and
tombs
which
were
built
in
the
great
days
of
the
mohammedan
emperors
and
which
are
marvels
of
cost
magnitude
and
richness
of
materials
and
ornamentation
creations
of
surpassing
grandeur
wonders
which
do
indeed
make
the
like
things
in
the
rest
of
the
world
seem
tame
and
inconsequential
by
comparison
i
am
not
purposing
to
describe
them
by
good
fortune
i
had
not
read
too
much
about
them
and
therefore
was
able
to
get
a
natural
and
rational
focus
upon
them
with
the
result
that
they
thrilled
blessed
and
exalted
me
but
if
i
had
previously
overheated
my
imagination
by
drinking
too
much
pestilential
literary
hot
scotch
i
should
have
suffered
disappointment
and
sorrow
i
mean
to
speak
of
only
one
of
these
many
world
renowned
buildings
the
taj
mahal
the
most
celebrated
construction
in
the
earth
i
had
read
a
great
deal
too
much
about
it
i
saw
it
in
the
daytime
i
saw
it
in
the
moonlight
i
saw
it
near
at
hand
i
saw
it
from
a
distance
and
i
knew
all
the
time
that
of
its
kind
it
was
the
wonder
of
the
world
with
no
competitor
now
and
no
possible
future
competitor
and
yet
it
was
not
my
taj
my
taj
had
been
built
by
excitable
literary
people
it
was
solidly
lodged
in
my
head
and
i
could
not
blast
it
out
i
wish
to
place
before
the
reader
some
of
the
usual
descriptions
of
the
taj
and
ask
him
to
take
note
of
the
impressions
left
in
his
mind
these
descriptions
do
really
state
the
truth
as
nearly
as
the
limitations
of
language
will
allow
but
language
is
a
treacherous
thing
a
most
unsure
vehicle
and
it
can
seldom
arrange
descriptive
words
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
not
inflate
the
facts
by
help
of
the
reader's
imagination
which
is
always
ready
to
take
a
hand
and
work
for
nothing
and
do
the
bulk
of
it
at
that
i
will
begin
with
a
few
sentences
from
the
excellent
little
local
guide
book
of
mr
satya
chandra
mukerji
i
take
them
from
here
and
there
in
his
description
the
inlaid
work
of
the
taj
and
the
flowers
and
petals
that
are
to
be
found
on
all
sides
on
the
surface
of
the
marble
evince
a
most
delicate
touch
that
is
true
the
inlaid
work
the
marble
the
flowers
the
buds
the
leaves
the
petals
and
the
lotus
stems
are
almost
without
a
rival
in
the
whole
of
the
civilized
world
the
work
of
inlaying
with
stones
and
gems
is
found
in
the
highest
perfection
in
the
taj
gems
inlaid
flowers
buds
and
leaves
to
be
found
on
all
sides
what
do
you
see
before
you
is
the
fairy
structure
growing
is
it
becoming
a
jewel
casket
the
whole
of
the
taj
produces
a
wonderful
effect
that
is
equally
sublime
and
beautiful
then

sir
william
continues
i
will
italicize
some
of
his
words
the
mausoleum
stands
on
a
raised
marble
platform
at
each
of
whose
corners
rises
a
tall
and
slender
minaret
of
graceful
proportions
and
of
exquisite
beauty
beyond
the
platform
stretch
the
two
wings
one
of
which
is
itself
a
mosque
of
great
architectural
merit
in
the
center
of
the
whole
design
the
mausoleum
occupies
a
square
of
186
feet
with
the
angles
deeply
truncated
so
also
form
an
unequal
octagon
the
main
feature
in
this
central
pile
is
the
great
dome
which
swells
upward
to
nearly
two
thirds
of
a
sphere
and
tapers
at
its
extremity
into
a
pointed
spire
crowned
by
a
crescent
beneath
it
an

of
marble
trellis

the
tomb
of
the

and
of
her
husband
the

each
corner
of
the
mausoleum
is
covered
by
a
similar
though
much
smaller

erected
on
a
pediment
pierced
with
graceful
saracenic
arches
light
is
admitted
into
the
interior
through
a
double
screen
of
pierced
marble
which
tempers
the
glare
of
an
indian
sky
while
its
whiteness
prevents
the
mellow
effect
from
degenerating
into
gloom
the
internal
decorations
consist
of
inlaid
work
in
precious
stones
such
as
agate
jasper
etc
with
which
every
squandril
or
salient
point
in
the
architecture
is
richly
fretted
brown
and
violet
marble
is
also
freely
employed
in
wreaths
scrolls
and
lintels
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
white
wall
in
regard
to
color
and
design
the
interior
of
the
taj
may
rank
first
in
the
world
for
purely
decorative
workmanship
while
the
perfect
symmetry
of
its
exterior
once
seen
can
never
be
forgotten
nor
the
aerial
grace
of
its
domes
rising
like
marble
bubbles
into
the
clear
sky
the
taj
represents
the
most
highly
elaborated
stage
of
ornamentation
reached
by
the
indo
mohammedan
builders
the
stage
in
which
the
architect
ends
and
the
jeweler
begins
in
its
magnificent
gateway

diagonal
ornamentation
at
the
corners
which
satisfied
the
designers
of
the
gateways
of
itimad
ud
doulah
and
sikandra
mausoleums
is
superseded
by
fine
marble
cables
in
bold
twists
strong
and
handsome
the
triangular
insertions
of
white
marble
and
large
flowers
have
in
like
manner
given
place
to
fine
inlaid
work
firm
perpendicular
lines
in
black
marble
with
well
proportioned
panels
of
the
same
material
are
effectively
used
in
the
interior
of
the
gateway
on
its
top
the
hindu
brackets
and
monolithic
architraves
of
sikandra
are
replaced
by
moorish
carped

usually
single
blocks
of
red
sandstone

the
kiosks
and
pavilions
which
adorn

is
obtained
of

farther
end

passes
up

straight
alley
shaded
by
evergreen
trees
cooled
by
a
broad
shallow
piece
of
water
running
along
the
middle
of
the
path
to
the
taj
itself
the
taj
is
entirely
of
marble
and

the
red
sandstone
of
the
other
mohammedan
buildings
has
entirely
disappeared
or
rather
the
red
sandstone
which
used
to
form
the
thickness
of
the
walls
is
in
the

itself
overlaid
completely
with
white
marble
and
the
white
marble
is
itself
inlaid
with
precious
stones
arranged
in
lovely
patterns
of
flowers
a
feeling
of
purity
impresses
itself
on
the
eye
and
the
mind
from
the
absence
of
the
coarser
material
which
forms
so
invariable

the

wall
and
panels
are
covered
with
tulips
oleanders

fullblown
lilies
in
flat
carving
on
the
white

and
although
the
inlaid
work
of
flowers
done
in
gems
is
very
brilliant
when
looked
at
closely
there
is
on
the
whole
but
little
color
and
the
all
prevailing
sentiment
is
one
of
whiteness
silence
and
calm
the
whiteness
is
broken
only
by
the
fine
color
of
the
inlaid
gems
by
lines
in
black
marble
and
by
delicately
written
inscriptions
also
in

vast
mausoleum
a
high
and
beautiful
screen
of
open
tracery
in
white
marble
rises
around
the
two
tombs
or
rather
cenotaphs
of
the
emperor
and
his
princess
and
in
this
marvel
of
marble
the
carving
has
advanced
from
the
old
geometrical
patterns
to
a
trellis
work
of
flowers
and
foliage
handled
with
great
freedom
and
spirit
the
two
cenotaphs
in
the
center
of
the
exquisite
enclosure
have
no
carving
except
the
plain
kalamdan
or
oblong
pen
box
on
the
tomb
of
emperor
shah
jehan
but
both
cenotaphs
are
inlaid
with

of

with

graceful

describing
the

on
to

on
both
sides
the
palm
the
banyan
and
the
feathery
bamboo
mingle
their
foliage
the
song
of
birds
meets
your
ears
and
the
odor
of
roses
and
lemon
flowers
sweetens
the
air
down
such
a
vista
and
over
such
a
foreground
rises
the
taj
there
is
no
mystery
no
sense
of
partial
failure
about
the
taj
a
thing
of
perfect
beauty
and
of
absolute
finish
in
every
detail
it
might
pass
for
the
work
of
genii
who
knew
naught
of
the
weaknesses
and
ills
with
which
mankind
are
beset
all
of
these
details
are
true
but
taken
together
they
state
a
falsehood
to
you
you
cannot
add
them
up
correctly
those
writers
know
the
values
of
their
words
and
phrases
but
to
you
the
words
and
phrases
convey
other
and
uncertain
values
to
those
writers
their
phrases
have
values
which
i
think
i
am
now
acquainted
with
and
for
the
help
of
the
reader
i
will
here
repeat
certain
of
those
words
and
phrases
and
follow
them
with
numerals
which
shall
represent
those
values
then
we
shall
see
the
difference
between
a
writer's
ciphering
and
a
mistaken
reader's
precious
stones
such
as
agate
jasper
etc
5
with
which
every
salient
point
is
richly
fretted
5
first
in
the
world
for
purely
decorative
workmanship

the
taj
represents
the
stage
where
the
architect
ends
and
the
jeweler
begins
5
the
taj
is
entirely
of
marble
and
gems
7
inlaid
with
precious
stones
in
lovely
patterns
of
flowers
5
the
inlaid
work
of
flowers
done
in
gems
is
very
brilliant
followed
by
a
most
important
modification
which
the
reader
is
sure
to
read
too
carelessly

those

are
correct
the
figures
which
i
have
placed

represent
quite
fairly
their

then
why
as
a
whole
do
they
convey
a
false
impression
to
the
reader
it
is
because
the
reader
beguiled
by
his
heated
imagination
masses
them
in
the
wrong
way
the
writer
would
mass
the
first
three
figures
in
the

way

they
would
speak
the
truth

but
the
reader
masses
them
thus
and
then
they
tell
a
lie

the
writer
would
add
all
of
his
twelve
numerals
together
and
then
the
sum
would
express
the
whole
truth
about
the
taj
and
the
truth
only

but
the
reader
always
helped
by
his
imagination
would
put
the
figures
in

get
this
sum

would
tell

must
put

yourself
i
have
to
go
on
with
my
work
the
reader
will
always
be
sure
to
put
the

together
in

then
as
surely
before

will
stand
sparkling
in

a
gem
crusted
taj
tall
as
the
matterhorn
i
had
to
visit
niagara
fifteen
times
before
i
succeeded
in
getting
my
imaginary
falls
gauged
to
the
actuality
and
could
begin
to
sanely
and
wholesomely
wonder
at
them
for
what
they
were
not
what
i
had
expected
them
to
be
when
i
first
approached
them
it
was
with
my
face
lifted
toward
the
sky
for
i
thought
i
was
going
to
see
an
atlantic
ocean
pouring
down
thence
over
cloud
vexed
himalayan
heights
a
sea
green
wall
of
water
sixty
miles
front
and
six
miles
high
and
so
when
the
toy
reality
came
suddenly
into
view
that
beruiled
little
wet
apron
hanging
out
to
dry
the
shock
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
fell
with
a
dull
thud
yet
slowly
surely
steadily
in
the
course
of
my
fifteen
visits
the
proportions
adjusted
themselves
to
the
facts
and
i
came
at
last
to
realize
that
a
waterfall
a
hundred
and
sixty
five
feet
high
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
was
an
impressive
thing
it
was
not
a
dipperful
to
my
vanished
great
vision
but
it
would
answer
i
know
that
i
ought
to
do
with
the
taj
as
i
was
obliged
to
do
with
niagara
see
it
fifteen
times
and
let
my
mind
gradually
get
rid
of
the
taj
built
in
it
by
its
describers
by
help
of
my
imagination
and
substitute
for
it
the
taj
of
fact
it
would
be
noble
and
fine
then
and
a
marvel
not
the
marvel
which
it
replaced
but
still
a
marvel
and
fine
enough
i
am
a
careless
reader
i
suppose
an
impressionist
reader
an
impressionist
reader
of
what
is
not
an
impressionist
picture
a
reader
who
overlooks
the
informing
details
or
masses
their
sum
improperly
and
gets
only
a
large
splashy
general
effect
an
effect
which
is
not
correct
and
which
is
not
warranted
by
the
particulars
placed
before
me
particulars
which
i
did
not
examine
and
whose
meanings
i
did
not
cautiously
and
carefully
estimate
it
is
an
effect
which
is
some
thirty
five
or
forty
times
finer
than
the
reality
and
is
therefore
a
great
deal
better
and
more
valuable
than
the
reality
and
so
i
ought
never
to
hunt
up
the
reality
but
stay
miles
away
from
it
and
thus
preserve
undamaged
my
own
private
mighty
niagara
tumbling
out
of
the
vault
of
heaven
and
my
own
ineffable
taj
built
of
tinted
mists
upon
jeweled
arches
of
rainbows
supported
by
colonnades
of
moonlight
it
is
a
mistake
for
a
person
with
an
unregulated
imagination
to
go
and
look
at
an
illustrious
world's
wonder
i
suppose
that
many
many
years
ago
i
gathered
the
idea
that
the
taj's
place
in
the
achievements
of
man
was
exactly
the
place
of
the
ice
storm
in
the
achievements
of
nature
that
the
taj
represented
man's
supremest
possibility
in
the
creation
of
grace
and
beauty
and
exquisiteness
and
splendor
just
as
the
ice
storm
represents
nature's
supremest
possibility
in
the
combination
of
those
same
qualities
i
do
not
know
how
long
ago
that
idea
was
bred
in
me
but
i
know
that
i
cannot
remember
back
to
a
time
when
the
thought
of
either
of
these
symbols
of
gracious
and
unapproachable
perfection
did
not
at
once
suggest
the
other
if
i
thought
of
the
ice
storm
the
taj
rose
before
me
divinely
beautiful
if
i
thought
of
the
taj
with
its
encrustings
and
inlayings
of
jewels
the
vision
of
the
ice
storm
rose
and
so
to
me
all
these
years
the
taj
has
had
no
rival
among
the
temples
and
palaces
of
men
none
that
even
remotely
approached
it
it
was
man's
architectural
ice
storm
here
in
london
the
other
night
i
was
talking
with
some
scotch
and
english
friends
and
i
mentioned
the
ice
storm
using
it
as
a
figure
a
figure
which
failed
for
none
of
them
had
heard
of
the
ice
storm
one
gentleman
who
was
very
familiar
with
american
literature
said
he
had
never
seen
it
mentioned
in
any
book
that
is
strange
and
i
myself
was
not
able
to
say
that
i
had
seen
it
mentioned
in
a
book
and
yet
the
autumn
foliage
with
all
other
american
scenery
has
received
full
and
competent
attention
the
oversight
is
strange
for
in
america
the
ice
storm
is
an
event
and
it
is
not
an
event
which
one
is
careless
about
when
it
comes
the
news
flies
from
room
to
room
in
the
house
there
are
bangings
on
the
doors
and
shoutings
the
ice
storm!
the
ice
storm!
and
even
the
laziest
sleepers
throw
off
the
covers
and
join
the
rush
for
the
windows
the
ice
storm
occurs
in
midwinter
and
usually
its
enchantments
are
wrought
in
the
silence
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
a
fine
drizzling
rain
falls
hour
after
hour
upon
the
naked
twigs
and
branches
of
the
trees
and
as
it
falls
it
freezes
in
time
the
trunk
and
every
branch
and
twig
are
incased
in
hard
pure
ice
so
that
the
tree
looks
like
a
skeleton
tree
made
all
of
glass
glass
that
is
crystal
clear
all
along
the
underside
of
every
branch
and
twig
is
a
comb
of
little
icicles
the
frozen
drip
sometimes
these
pendants
do
not
quite
amount
to
icicles
but
are
round
beads
frozen
tears
the
weather
clears
toward
dawn
and
leaves
a
brisk
pure
atmosphere
and
a
sky
without
a
shred
of
cloud
in
it
and
everything
is
still
there
is
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
dawn
breaks
and
spreads
the
news
of
the
storm
goes
about
the
house
and
the
little
and
the
big
in
wraps
and
blankets
flock
to
the
window
and
press
together
there
and
gaze
intently
out
upon
the
great
white
ghost
in
the
grounds
and
nobody
says
a
word
nobody
stirs
all
are
waiting
they
know
what
is
coming
and
they
are
waiting
waiting
for
the
miracle
the
minutes
drift
on
and
on
and
on
with
not
a
sound
but
the
ticking
of
the
clock
at
last
the
sun
fires
a
sudden
sheaf
of
rays
into
the
ghostly
tree
and
turns
it
into
a
white
splendor
of
glittering
diamonds
everybody
catches
his
breath
and
feels
a
swelling
in
his
throat
and
a
moisture
in
his
eyes
but
waits
again
for
he
knows
what
is
coming
there
is
more
yet
the
sun
climbs
higher
and
still
higher
flooding
the
tree
from
its
loftiest
spread
of
branches
to
its
lowest
turning
it
to
a
glory
of
white
fire
then
in
a
moment
without
warning
comes
the
great
miracle
the
supreme
miracle
the
miracle
without
its
fellow
in
the
earth
a
gust
of
wind
sets
every
branch
and
twig
to
swaying
and
in
an
instant
turns
the
whole
white
tree
into
a
spouting
and
spraying
explosion
of
flashing
gems
of
every
conceivable
color
and
there
it
stands
and
sways
this
way
and
that
flash!
flash!
flash!
a
dancing
and
glancing
world
of
rubies
emeralds
diamonds
sapphires
the
most
radiant
spectacle
the
most
blinding
spectacle
the
divinest
the
most
exquisite
the
most
intoxicating
vision
of
fire
and
color
and
intolerable
and
unimaginable
splendor
that
ever
any
eye
has
rested
upon
in
this
world
or
will
ever
rest
upon
outside
of
the
gates
of
heaven
by
all
my
senses
all
my
faculties
i
know
that
the
icestorm
is
nature's
supremest
achievement
in
the
domain
of
the
superb
and
the
beautiful
and
by
my
reason
at
least
i
know
that
the
taj
is
man's
ice
storm
in
the
ice
storm
every
one
of
the
myriad
ice
beads
pendant
from
twig
and
branch
is
an
individual
gem
and
changes
color
with
every
motion
caused
by
the
wind
each
tree
carries
a
million
and
a
forest
front
exhibits
the
splendors
of
the
single
tree
multiplied
by
a
thousand
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
i
have
never
seen
the
ice
storm
put
upon
canvas
and
have
not
heard
that
any
painter
has
tried
to
do
it
i
wonder
why
that
is
is
it
that
paint
cannot
counterfeit
the
intense
blaze
of
a
sun
flooded
jewel
there
should
be
and
must
be
a
reason
and
a
good
one
why
the
most
enchanting
sight
that
nature
has
created
has
been
neglected
by
the
brush
often
the
surest
way
to
convey
misinformation
is
to
tell
the
strict
truth
the
describers
of
the
taj
have
used
the
word
gem
in
its
strictest
sense
its
scientific
sense
in
that
sense
it
is
a
mild
word
and
promises
but
little
to
the
eye
nothing
bright
nothing
brilliant
nothing
sparkling
nothing
splendid
in
the
way
of
color
it
accurately
describes
the
sober
and
unobtrusive
gem
work
of
the
taj
that
is
to
the
very
highly
educated
one
person
in
a
thousand
but
it
most
falsely
describes
it
to
the
999
but
the
999
are
the
people
who
ought
to
be
especially
taken
care
of
and
to
them
it
does
not
mean
quiet
colored
designs
wrought
in
carnelians
or
agates
or
such
things
they
know
the
word
in
its
wide
and
ordinary
sense
only
and
so
to
them
it
means
diamonds
and
rubies
and
opals
and
their
kindred
and
the
moment
their
eyes
fall
upon
it
in
print
they
see
a
vision
of
glorious
colors
clothed
in
fire
these
describers
are
writing
for
the
general
and
so
in
order
to
make
sure
of
being
understood
they
ought
to
use
words
in
their
ordinary
sense
or
else
explain
the
word
fountain
means
one
thing
in
syria
where
there
is
but
a
handful
of
people
it
means
quite
another
thing
in
north
america
where
there
are
75
000
000
if
i
were
describing
some
syrian
scenery
and
should
exclaim
within
the
narrow
space
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
square
i
saw
in
the
glory
of
the
flooding
moonlight
two
hundred
noble
fountains
imagine
the
spectacle!
the
north
american
would
have
a
vision
of
clustering
columns
of
water
soaring
aloft
bending
over
in
graceful
arches
bursting
in
beaded
spray
and
raining
white
fire
in
the
moonlight
and
he
would
be
deceived
but
the
syrian
would
not
be
deceived
he
would
merely
see
two
hundred
fresh
water
springs
two
hundred
drowsing
puddles
as
level
and
unpretentious
and
unexcited
as
so
many
door
mats
and
even
with
the
help
of
the
moonlight
he
would
not
lose
his
grip
in
the
presence
of
the
exhibition
my
word
fountain
would
be
correct
it
would
speak
the
strict
truth
and
it
would
convey
the
strict
truth
to
the
handful
of
syrians
and
the
strictest
misinformation
to
the
north
american
millions
with
their
gems
and
gems
and
more
gems
and
gems
again
and
still
other
gems
the
describers
of
the
taj
are
within
their
legal
but
not
their
moral
rights
they
are
dealing
in
the
strictest
scientific
truth
and
in
doing
it
they
succeed
to
admiration
in
telling
what
ain't
so

lent
me
an

this
hospitality
stands
out
in
my
experiences
in

stately
isolation
it
was
a
fine
elephant
affable
gentlemanly
educated
and
i
was
not
afraid
of
it
i
even
rode
it
with
confidence
through
the
crowded
lanes
of
the
native
city
where
it
scared
all
the
horses
out
of
their
senses
and
where
children
were
always
just
escaping
its
feet
it
took
the

left
it

get
out

i
could
have
ridden
in
comfort
through
a
regiment
of
runaway
teams
i
could
easily
learn
to
prefer
an
elephant
to
any
other
vehicle
partly
because
of
that
immunity
from
collisions
and
partly
because
of
the
fine
view
one
has
from
up
there
and
partly
because
of
the
dignity
one
feels
in
that
high
place
and
partly
because
one
can
look
in
at
the
windows
and
see
what
is
going
on
privately
among
the
family
the
lahore
horses
were
used
to
elephants
but
they
were
rapturously
afraid
of
them
just
the
same
it
seemed
curious
perhaps
the
better
they
know
the
elephant
the
more
they
respect
him
in
that
peculiar
way
in
our
own
case
we
are
not
afraid
of
dynamite
till
we
get
acquainted
with
it
we
drifted
as
far
as
rawal
pindi
away
up
on
the
afghan
frontier
i
think
it
was
the
afghan
frontier
but
it
may
have
been
hertzegovina
it
was
around
there
somewhere
and
down
again
to
delhi
to
see
the
ancient
architectural
wonders
there
and
in
old
delhi
and
not
describe
them
and
also
to
see
the
scene
of
the
illustrious
assault
in
the
mutiny
days
when
the
british
carried
delhi
by
storm
one
of
the
marvels
of
history
for
impudent
daring
and
immortal
valor
we
had
a
refreshing
rest
there
in
delhi
in
a
great
old
mansion
which
possessed
historical
interest
it
was
built
by
a
rich
englishman
who
had
become
orientalized
so
much
so
that
he
had
a
zenana
but
he
was
a
broadminded
man
and
remained
so
to
please
his
harem
he
built
a
mosque
to
please
himself
he
built
an
english
church
that
kind
of
a
man
will
arrive
somewhere
in
the
mutiny
days
the
mansion
was
the
british
general's
headquarters
it
stands
in
a
great
garden
oriental
fashion
and
about
it
are
many
noble
trees
the
trees
harbor
monkeys
and
they
are
monkeys
of
a
watchful
and
enterprising
sort
and
not
much
troubled
with
fear
they
invade
the
house
whenever
they
get
a
chance
and
carry
off
everything
they
don't
want
one
morning
the
master
of
the
house
was
in
his
bath
and
the
window
was
open
near
it
stood
a
pot
of
yellow
paint
and
a
brush
some
monkeys
appeared
in
the
window
to
scare
them
away
the
gentleman
threw
his
sponge
at
them
they
did
not
scare
at
all
they
jumped
into
the
room
and
threw
yellow
paint
all
over
him
from
the
brush
and
drove
him
out
then
they
painted
the
walls
and
the
floor
and
the
tank
and
the
windows
and
the
furniture
yellow
and
were
in
the
dressing
room
painting
that
when
help
arrived
and
routed
them
two
of
these
creatures
came
into
my
room
in
the
early
morning
through
a
window
whose
shutters
i
had
left
open
and
when
i
woke
one
of
them
was
before
the
glass
brushing
his
hair
and
the
other
one
had
my
note
book
and
was
reading
a
page
of
humorous
notes
and
crying
i
did
not
mind
the
one
with
the
hair
brush
but
the
conduct
of
the
other
one
hurt
me
it
hurts
me
yet
i
threw
something
at
him
and
that
was
wrong
for
my
host
had
told
me
that
the
monkeys
were
best
left
alone
they
threw
everything
at
me
that
they
could
lift
and
then
went
into
the
bathroom
to
get
some
more
things
and
i
shut
the
door
on
them
at
jeypore
in
rajputana
we
made
a
considerable
stay
we
were
not
in
the
native
city
but
several
miles
from
it
in
the
small
european
official
suburb
there
were
but
few
europeans
only
fourteen
but
they
were
all
kind
and
hospitable
and
it
amounted
to
being
at
home
in
jeypore
we
found
again
what
we
had
found
all
about
india
that
while
the
indian
servant
is
in
his
way
a
very
real
treasure
he
will
sometimes
bear
watching
and
the
englishman
watches
him
if
he
sends
him
on
an
errand
he
wants
more
than
the
man's
word
for
it
that
he
did
the
errand
when
fruit
and
vegetables
were
sent
to
us
a
chit
came
with
them
a
receipt
for
us
to
sign
otherwise
the
things
might
not
arrive
if
a
gentleman
sent
up
his
carriage
the
chit
stated
from
such
and
such
an
hour
to
such
and
such
an
hour
which
made
it
unhandy
for
the
coachman
and
his
two
or
three
subordinates
to
put
us
off
with
a
part
of
the
allotted
time
and
devote
the
rest
of
it
to
a
lark
of
their
own
we
were
pleasantly
situated
in
a
small
two
storied
inn
in
an
empty
large
compound
which
was
surrounded
by
a
mud
wall
as
high
as
a
man's
head
the
inn
was
kept
by
nine
hindoo
brothers
its
owners
they
lived
with
their
families
in
a
one
storied
building
within
the
compound
but
off
to
one
side
and
there
was
always
a
long
pile
of
their
little
comely
brown
children
loosely
stacked
in
its
veranda
and
a
detachment
of
the
parents
wedged
among
them
smoking
the
hookah
or
the
howdah
or
whatever
they
call
it
by
the
veranda
stood
a
palm
and
a
monkey
lived
in
it
and
led
a
lonesome
life
and
always
looked
sad
and
weary
and
the
crows
bothered
him
a
good
deal
the
inn
cow
poked
about
the
compound
and
emphasized
the
secluded
and
country
air
of
the
place
and
there
was
a
dog
of
no
particular
breed
who
was
always
present
in
the
compound
and
always
asleep
always
stretched
out
baking
in
the
sun
and
adding
to
the
deep
tranquility
and
reposefulness
of
the
place
when
the
crows
were
away
on
business
white
draperied
servants
were
coming
and
going
all
the
time
but
they
seemed
only
spirits
for
their
feet
were
bare
and
made
no
sound
down
the
lane
a
piece
lived
an
elephant
in
the
shade
of
a
noble
tree
and
rocked
and
rocked
and
reached
about
with
his
trunk
begging
of
his
brown
mistress
or
fumbling
the
children
playing
at
his
feet
and
there
were
camels
about
but
they
go
on
velvet
feet
and
were
proper
to
the
silence
and
serenity
of
the
surroundings
the
satan
mentioned
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
was
not
our
satan
but
the
other
one
our
satan
was
lost
to
us
in
these
later
days
he
had
passed
out
of
our
life
lamented
by
me
and
sincerely
i
was
missing
him
i
am
missing
him
yet
after
all
these
months
he
was
an
astonishing
creature
to
fly
around
and
do
things
he
didn't
always
do
them
quite
right
but
he
did
them
and
did
them
suddenly
there
was
no
time
wasted
you
would
say
pack
the
trunks
and
bags
satan
wair
good
very
good
then
there
would
be
a
brief
sound
of
thrashing
and
slashing
and
humming
and
buzzing
and
a
spectacle
as
of
a
whirlwind
spinning
gowns
and
jackets
and
coats
and
boots
and
things
through
the
air
and
then
with
bow
and
touch
awready
master
it
was
wonderful
it
made
one
dizzy
he
crumpled
dresses
a
good
deal
and
he
had
no
particular
plan
about
the
work
at
first
except
to
put
each
article
into
the
trunk
it
didn't
belong
in
but
he
soon
reformed
in
this
matter
not
entirely
for
to
the
last
he
would
cram
into
the
satchel
sacred
to
literature
any
odds
and
ends
of
rubbish
that
he
couldn't
find
a
handy
place
for
elsewhere
when
threatened
with
death
for
this
it
did
not
trouble
him
he
only
looked
pleasant
saluted
with
soldierly
grace
said
wair
good
and
did
it
again
next
day
he
was
always
busy
kept
the
rooms
tidied
up
the
boots
polished
the
clothes
brushed
the
wash
basin
full
of
clean
water
my
dress
clothes
laid
out
and
ready
for
the
lecture
hall
an
hour
ahead
of
time
and
he
dressed
me
from
head
to
heel
in
spite
of
my
determination
to
do
it
myself
according
to
my
lifelong
custom
he
was
a
born
boss
and
loved
to
command
and
to
jaw
and
dispute
with
inferiors
and
harry
them
and
bullyrag
them
he
was
fine
at
the
railway
station
yes
he
was
at
his
finest
there
he
would
shoulder
and
plunge
and
paw
his
violent
way
through
the
packed
multitude
of
natives
with
nineteen
coolies
at
his
tail
each
bearing
a
trifle
of
luggage
one
a
trunk
another
a
parasol
another
a
shawl
another
a
fan
and
so
on
one
article
to
each
and
the
longer
the
procession
the
better
he
was
suited
and
he
was
sure
to
make
for
some
engaged
sleeper
and
begin
to
hurl
the
owner's
things
out
of
it
swearing
that
it
was
ours
and
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
arrived
at
our
own
sleeper
he
would
undo
the
bedding
bundles
and
make
the
beds
and
put
everything
to
rights
and
shipshape
in
two
minutes
then
put
his
head
out
at
a
window
and
have
a
restful
good
time
abusing
his
gang
of
coolies
and
disputing
their
bill
until
we
arrived
and
made
him
pay
them
and
stop
his
noise
speaking
of
noise
he
certainly
was
the
noisest
little
devil
in
india
and
that
is
saying
much
very
much
indeed
i
loved
him
for
his
noise
but
the
family
detested
him
for
it
they
could
not
abide
it
they
could
not
get
reconciled
to
it
it
humiliated
them
as
a
rule
when
we
got
within
six
hundred
yards
of
one
of
those
big
railway
stations
a
mighty
racket
of
screaming
and
shrieking
and
shouting
and
storming
would
break
upon
us
and
i
would
be
happy
to
myself
and
the
family
would
say
with
shame
there
that's
satan
why
do
you
keep
him
and
sure
enough
there
in
the
whirling
midst
of
fifteen
hundred
wondering
people
we
would
find
that
little
scrap
of
a
creature
gesticulating
like
a
spider
with
the
colic
his
black
eyes
snapping
his
fez
tassel
dancing
his
jaws
pouring
out
floods
of
billingsgate
upon
his
gang
of
beseeching
and
astonished
coolies
i
loved
him
i
couldn't
help
it
but
the
family
why
they
could
hardly
speak
of
him
with
patience
to
this
day
i
regret
his
loss
and
wish
i
had
him
back
but
they
it
is
different
with
them
he
was
a
native
and
came
from
surat
twenty
degrees
of
latitude
lay
between
his
birthplace
and
manuel's
and
fifteen
hundred
between
their
ways
and
characters
and
dispositions
i
only
liked
manuel
but
i
loved
satan
this
latter's
real
name
was
intensely
indian
i
could
not
quite
get
the
hang
of
it
but
it
sounded
like
bunder
rao
ram
chunder
clam
chowder
it
was
too
long
for
handy
use
anyway
so
i
reduced
it
when
he
had
been
with
us
two
or
three
weeks
he
began
to
make
mistakes
which
i
had
difficulty
in
patching
up
for
him
approaching
benares
one
day
he
got
out
of
the
train
to
see
if
he
could
get
up
a
misunderstanding
with
somebody
for
it
had
been
a
weary
long
journey
and
he
wanted
to
freshen
up
he
found
what
he
was
after
but
kept
up
his
pow
wow
a
shade
too
long
and
got
left
so
there
we
were
in
a
strange
city
and
no
chambermaid
it
was
awkward
for
us
and
we
told
him
he
must
not
do
so
any
more
he
saluted
and
said
in
his
dear
pleasant
way
wair
good
then
at
lucknow
he
got
drunk
i
said
it
was
a
fever
and
got
the
family's
compassion
and
solicitude
aroused
so
they
gave
him
a
teaspoonful
of
liquid
quinine
and
it
set
his
vitals
on
fire
he
made
several
grimaces
which
gave
me
a
better
idea
of
the
lisbon
earthquake
than
any
i
have
ever
got
of
it
from
paintings
and
descriptions
his
drunk
was
still
portentously
solid
next
morning
but
i
could
have
pulled
him
through
with
the
family
if
he
would
only
have
taken
another
spoonful
of
that
remedy
but
no
although
he
was
stupefied
his
memory
still
had
flickerings
of
life
so
he
smiled
a
divinely
dull
smile
and
said
fumblingly
saluting
scoose
me
mem
saheb
scoose
me
missy
saheb
satan
not
prefer
it
please
then
some
instinct
revealed
to
them
that
he
was
drunk
they
gave
him
prompt
notice
that
next
time
this
happened
he
must
go
he
got
out
a
maudlin
and
most
gentle
wair
good
and
saluted
indefinitely
only
one
short
week
later
he
fell
again
and
oh
sorrow!
not
in
a
hotel
this
time
but
in
an
english
gentleman's
private
house
and
in
agra
of
all
places
so
he
had
to
go
when
i
told
him
he
said
patiently
wair
good
and
made
his
parting
salute
and
went
out
from
us
to
return
no
more
forever
dear
me!
i
would
rather
have
lost
a
hundred
angels
than
that
one
poor
lovely
devil
what
style
he
used
to
put
on
in
a
swell
hotel
or
in
a
private
house
snow
white
muslin
from
his
chin
to
his
bare
feet
a
crimson
sash
embroidered
with
gold
thread
around
his
waist
and
on
his
head
a
great
sea
green
turban
like
to
the
turban
of
the
grand
turk
he
was
not
a
liar
but
he
will
become
one
if
he
keeps
on
he
told
me
once
that
he
used
to
crack
cocoanuts
with
his
teeth
when
he
was
a
boy
and
when
i
asked
how
he
got
them
into
his
mouth
he
said
he
was
upward
of
six
feet
high
at
that
time
and
had
an
unusual
mouth
and
when
i
followed
him
up
and
asked
him
what
had
become
of
that
other
foot
he
said
a
house
fell
on
him
and
he
was
never
able
to
get
his
stature
back
again
swervings
like
these
from
the
strict
line
of
fact
often
beguile
a
truthful
man
on
and
on
until
he
eventually
becomes
a
liar
his
successor
was
a
mohammedan
sahadat
mohammed
khan
very
dark
very
tall
very
grave
he
went
always
in
flowing
masses
of
white
from
the
top
of
his
big
turban
down
to
his
bare
feet
his
voice
was
low
he
glided
about
in
a
noiseless
way
and
looked
like
a
ghost
he
was
competent
and
satisfactory
but
where
he
was
it
seemed
always
sunday
it
was
not
so
in
satan's
time
jeypore
is
intensely
indian
but
it
has
two
or
three
features
which
indicate
the
presence
of
european
science
and
european
interest
in
the
weal
of
the
common
public
such
as
the
liberal
water
supply
furnished
by
great
works
built
at
the
state's
expense
good
sanitation
resulting
in
a
degree
of
healthfulness
unusually
high
for
india
a
noble
pleasure
garden
with
privileged
days
for
women
schools
for
the
instruction
of
native
youth
in
advanced
art
both
ornamental
and
utilitarian
and
a
new
and
beautiful
palace
stocked
with
a
museum
of
extraordinary
interest
and
value
without
the
maharaja's
sympathy
and
purse
these
beneficences
could
not
have
been
created
but
he
is
a
man
of
wide
views
and
large
generosities
and
all
such
matters
find
hospitality
with
him
we
drove
often
to
the
city
from
the
hotel
kaiser
i
hind
a
journey
which
was
always
full
of
interest
both
night
and
day
for
that
country
road
was
never
quiet
never
empty
but
was
always
india
in
motion
always
a
streaming
flood
of
brown
people
clothed
in
smouchings
from
the
rainbow
a
tossing
and
moiling
flood
happy
noisy
a
charming
and
satisfying
confusion
of
strange
human
and
strange
animal
life
and
equally
strange
and
outlandish
vehicles
and
the
city
itself
is
a
curiosity
any
indian
city
is
that
but
this
one
is
not
like
any
other
that
we
saw
it
is
shut
up
in
a
lofty
turreted
wall
the
main
body
of
it
is
divided
into
six
parts
by
perfectly
straight
streets
that
are
more
than
a
hundred
feet
wide
the
blocks
of
houses
exhibit
a
long
frontage
of
the
most
taking
architectural
quaintnesses
the
straight
lines
being
broken
everywhere
by
pretty
little
balconies
pillared
and
highly
ornamented
and
other
cunning
and
cozy
and
inviting
perches
and
projections
and
many
of
the
fronts
are
curiously
pictured
by
the
brush
and
the
whole
of
them
have
the
soft
rich
tint
of
strawberry
ice
cream
one
cannot
look
down
the
far
stretch
of
the
chief
street
and
persuade
himself
that
these
are
real
houses
and
that
it
is
all
out
of
doors
the
impression
that
it
is
an
unreality
a
picture
a
scene
in
a
theater
is
the
only
one
that
will
take
hold
then
there
came
a
great
day
when
this
illusion
was
more
pronounced
than
ever
a
rich
hindoo
had
been
spending
a
fortune
upon
the
manufacture
of
a
crowd
of
idols
and
accompanying
paraphernalia
whose
purpose
was
to
illustrate
scenes
in
the
life
of
his
especial
god
or
saint
and
this
fine
show
was
to
be
brought
through
the
town
in
processional
state
at
ten
in
the
morning
as
we
passed
through
the
great
public
pleasure
garden
on
our
way
to
the
city
we
found
it
crowded
with
natives
that
was
one
sight
then
there
was
another
in
the
midst
of
the
spacious
lawns
stands
the
palace
which
contains
the
museum
a
beautiful
construction
of
stone
which
shows
arched
colonnades
one
above
another
and
receding
terrace
fashion
toward
the
sky
every
one
of
these
terraces
all
the
way
to
the
top
one
was
packed
and
jammed
with
natives
one
must
try
to
imagine
those
solid
masses
of
splendid
color
one
above
another
up
and
up
against
the
blue
sky
and
the
indian
sun
turning
them
all
to
beds
of
fire
and
flame
later
when
we
reached
the
city
and
glanced
down
the
chief
avenue
smouldering
in
its
crushed
strawberry
tint
those
splendid
effects
were
repeated
for
every
balcony
and
every
fanciful
bird
cage
of
a
snuggery
countersunk
in
the
house
fronts
and
all
the
long
lines
of
roofs
were
crowded
with
people
and
each
crowd
was
an
explosion
of
brilliant
color
then
the
wide
street
itself
away
down
and
down
and
down
into
the
distance
was
alive
with
gorgeously
clothed
people
not
still
but
moving
swaying
drifting
eddying
a
delirious
display
of
all
colors
and
all
shades
of
color
delicate
lovely
pale
soft
strong
stunning
vivid
brilliant
a
sort
of
storm
of
sweetpea
blossoms
passing
on
the
wings
of
a
hurricane
and
presently
through
this
storm
of
color
came
swaying
and
swinging
the
majestic
elephants
clothed
in
their
sunday
best
of
gaudinesses
and
the
long
procession
of
fanciful
trucks
freighted
with
their
groups
of
curious
and
costly
images
and
then
the
long
rearguard
of
stately
camels
with
their
picturesque
riders
for
color
and
picturesqueness
and
novelty
and
outlandishness
and
sustained
interest
and
fascination
it
was
the
most
satisfying
show
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
suppose
i
shall
not
have
the
privilege
of
looking
upon
its
like
again
chapter

in
the
first

god
made
idiots
this
was
for
practice
then
he
made

suppose
we
applied
no
more
ingenuity
to
the
instruction
of
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
children
than
we
sometimes
apply
in
our
american
public
schools
to
the
instruction
of
children
who
are
in
possession
of
all
their
faculties
the
result
would
be
that
the
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
would
acquire
nothing
they
would
live
and
die
as
ignorant
as
bricks
and
stones
the
methods
used
in
the
asylums
are
rational
the
teacher
exactly
measures
the
child's
capacity
to
begin
with
and
from
thence
onwards
the
tasks
imposed
are
nicely
gauged
to
the
gradual
development
of
that
capacity
the
tasks
keep
pace
with
the
steps
of
the
child's
progress
they
don't
jump
miles
and
leagues
ahead
of
it
by
irrational
caprice
and
land
in
vacancy
according
to
the
average
public
school
plan
in
the
public
school
apparently
they
teach
the
child
to
spell
cat
then
ask
it
to
calculate
an
eclipse
when
it
can
read
words
of
two
syllables
they
require
it
to
explain
the
circulation
of
the
blood
when
it
reaches
the
head
of
the
infant
class
they
bully
it
with
conundrums
that
cover
the
domain
of
universal
knowledge
this
sounds
extravagant
and
is
yet
it
goes
no
great
way
beyond
the
facts
i
received
a
curious
letter
one
day
from
the
punjab
you
must
pronounce
it
punjawb
the
handwriting
was
excellent
and
the
wording
was
english
english
and
yet
not
exactly
english
the
style
was
easy
and
smooth
and
flowing
yet
there
was
something
subtly
foreign
about
it
a
something
tropically
ornate
and
sentimental
and
rhetorical
it
turned
out
to
be
the
work
of
a
hindoo
youth
the
holder
of
a
humble
clerical
billet
in
a
railway
office
he
had
been
educated
in
one
of
the
numerous
colleges
of
india
upon
inquiry
i
was
told
that
the
country
was
full
of
young
fellows
of
his
like
they
had
been
educated
away
up
to
the
snow
summits
of
learning
and
the
market
for
all
this
elaborate
cultivation
was
minutely
out
of
proportion
to
the
vastness
of
the
product
this
market
consisted
of
some
thousands
of
small
clerical
posts
under
the
government
the
supply
of
material
for
it
was
multitudinous
if
this
youth
with
the
flowing
style
and
the
blossoming
english
was
occupying
a
small
railway
clerkship
it
meant
that
there
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
as
capable
as
he
or
he
would
be
in
a
high
place
and
it
certainly
meant
that
there
were
thousands
whose
education
and
capacity
had
fallen
a
little
short
and
that
they
would
have
to
go
without
places
apparently
then
the
colleges
of
india
were
doing
what
our
high
schools
have
long
been
doing
richly
over
supplying
the
market
for
highly
educated
service
and
thereby
doing
a
damage
to
the
scholar
and
through
him
to
the
country
at
home
i
once
made
a
speech
deploring
the
injuries
inflicted
by
the
high
school
in
making
handicrafts
distasteful
to
boys
who
would
have
been
willing
to
make
a
living
at
trades
and
agriculture
if
they
had
but
had
the
good
luck
to
stop
with
the
common
school
but
i
made
no
converts
not
one
in
a
community
overrun
with
educated
idlers
who
were
above
following
their
fathers'
mechanical
trades
yet
could
find
no
market
for
their
book
knowledge
the
same
rail
that
brought
me
the
letter
from
the
punjab
brought
also
a
little
book
published
by
messrs
thacker
spink
&
co
of
calcutta
which
interested
me
for
both
its
preface
and
its
contents
treated
of
this
matter
of
over
education
in
the
preface
occurs
this
paragraph
from
the
calcutta
review
for
government
office
read
drygoods
clerkship
and
it
will
fit
more
than
one
region
of
america
the
education
that
we
give
makes
the
boys
a
little
less
clownish
in
their
manners
and
more
intelligent
when
spoken
to
by
strangers
on
the
other
hand
it
has
made
them
less
contented
with
their
lot
in
life
and
less
willing
to
work
with
their
hands
the
form
which
discontent
takes
in
this
country
is
not
of
a
healthy
kind
for
the
natives
of
india
consider
that
the
only
occupation
worthy
of
an
educated
man
is
that
of
a
writership
in
some
office
and
especially
in
a
government
office
the
village
schoolboy
goes
back
to
the
plow
with
the
greatest
reluctance
and
the
town
schoolboy
carries
the
same
discontent
and
inefficiency
into
his
father's
workshop
sometimes
these
ex
students
positively
refuse
at
first
to
work
and
more
than
once
parents
have
openly
expressed
their
regret
that
they
ever
allowed
their
sons
to
be
inveigled
to
school
the
little
book
which
i
am
quoting
from
is
called
indo
anglian
literature
and
is
well
stocked
with
baboo
english
clerkly
english
hooky
english
acquired
in
the
schools
some
of
it
is
very
funny
almost
as
funny
perhaps
as
what
you
and
i
produce
when
we
try
to
write
in
a
language
not
our
own
but
much
of
it
is
surprisingly
correct
and
free
if
i
were
going
to
quote
good
english
but
i
am
not
india
is
well
stocked
with
natives
who
speak
it
and
write
it
as
well
as
the
best
of
us
i
merely
wish
to
show
some
of
the
quaint
imperfect
attempts
at
the
use
of
our
tongue
there
are
many
letters
in
the
book
poverty
imploring
help
bread
money
kindness
office
generally
an

a

some
way
to
get

and
a
rag
out
of
the
applicant's
unmarketable
education
and
food
not
for
himself
alone
but
sometimes
for
a
dozen
helpless
relations
in
addition
to
his
own
family
for
those
people
are
astonishingly
unselfish
and
admirably
faithful
to
their
ties
of
kinship
among
us
i
think
there
is
nothing
approaching
it
strange
as
some
of
these
wailing
and
supplicating
letters
are
humble
and
even
groveling
as
some
of
them
are
and
quaintly
funny
and
confused
as
a
goodly
number
of
them
are
there
is
still
a
pathos
about
them
as
a
rule
that
checks
the
rising
laugh
and
reproaches
it
in
the
following
letter
father
is
not
to
be
read
literally
in
ceylon
a
little
native
beggar
girl
embarrassed
me
by
calling
me
father
although
i
knew
she
was
mistaken
i
was
so
new
that
i
did
not
know
that
she
was
merely
following
the
custom
of
the
dependent
and
the
supplicant
sir
i
pray
please
to
give
me
some
action
work
for
i
am
very
poor
boy
i
have
no
one
to
help
me
even
so
father
for
it
so
it
seemed
in
thy
good
sight
you
give
the
telegraph
office
and
another
work
what
is
your
wish
i
am
very
poor
boy
this
understand
what
is
your
wish
you
my
father
i
am
your
son
this
understand
what
is
your
wish
your
sirvent
p
c
b
through
ages
of
debasing
oppression
suffered
by
these
people
at
the
hands
of
their
native
rulers
they
come
legitimately
by
the
attitude
and
language
of
fawning
and
flattery
and
one
must
remember
this
in
mitigation
when
passing
judgment
upon
the
native
character
it
is
common
in
these
letters
to
find
the
petitioner
furtively
trying
to
get
at
the
white
man's
soft
religious
side
even
this
poor
boy
baits
his
hook
with
a
macerated
bible
text
in
the
hope
that
it
may
catch
something
if
all
else
fail
here
is
an
application
for
the
post
of
instructor
in
english
to
some
children
my
dear
sir
or
gentleman
that
your
petitioner
has
much
qualification
in
the
language
of
english
to
instruct
the
young
boys
i
was
given
to
understand
that
your
of
suitable
children
has
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
english
language
as
a
sample
of
the
flowery
eastern
style
i
will
take
a
sentence
or
two
from
along
letter
written
by
a
young
native
to
the
lieutenant
governor
of
bengal
an
application
for
employment
honored
and
much
respected
sir
i
hope
your
honor
will
condescend
to
hear
the
tale
of
this
poor
creature
i
shall
overflow
with
gratitude
at
this
mark
of
your
royal
condescension
the
bird
like
happiness
has
flown
away
from
my
nest
like
heart
and
has
not
hitherto
returned
from
the
period
whence
the
rose
of
my
father's
life
suffered
the
autumnal
breath
of
death
in
plain
english
he
passed
through
the
gates
of
grave
and
from
that
hour
the
phantom
of
delight
has
never
danced
before
me
it
is
all
school
english
book
english
you
see
and
good
enough
too
all
things
considered
if
the
native
boy
had
but
that
one
study
he
would
shine
he
would
dazzle
no
doubt
but
that
is
not
the
case
he
is
situated
as
are
our
public
school
children
loaded
down
with
an
over
freightage
of
other
studies
and
frequently
they
are
as
far
beyond
the
actual
point
of
progress
reached
by
him
and
suited
to
the
stage
of
development
attained
as
could
be
imagined
by
the
insanest
fancy
apparently
like
our
public
school
boy
he
must
work
work
work
in
school
and
out
and
play
but
little
apparently
like
our
public
school
boy
his
education
consists
in
learning
things
not
the
meaning
of
them
he
is
fed
upon
the
husks
not
the
corn
from
several
essays
written
by
native
schoolboys
in
answer
to
the
question
of
how
they
spend
their
day
i
select
one
the
one
which
goes
most
into
detail
66
at
the
break
of
day
i
rises
from
my
own
bed
and
finish
my
daily
duty
then
i
employ
myself
till
8
o'clock
after
which
i
employ
myself
to
bathe
then
take
for
my
body
some
sweet
meat
and
just
at
9
1/2
i
came
to
school
to
attend
my
class
duty
then
at
2
1/2
p
m
i
return
from
school
and
engage
myself
to
do
my
natural
duty
then
i
engage
for
a
quarter
to
take
my
tithn
then
i
study
till
5
p
m
after
which
i
began
to
play
anything
which
comes
in
my
head
after
8
1/2
half
pass
to
eight
we
are
began
to
sleep
before
sleeping
i
told
a
constable
just
11
o'
he
came
and
rose
us
from
half
pass
eleven
we
began
to
read
still
morning
it
is
not
perfectly
clear
now
that
i
come
to
cipher
upon
it
he
gets
up
at
about
5
in
the
morning
or
along
there
somewhere
and
goes
to
bed
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
hours
afterward
that
much
of
it
seems
straight
but
why
he
should
rise
again
three
hours
later
and
resume
his
studies
till
morning
is
puzzling
i
think
it
is
because
he
is
studying
history
history
requires
a
world
of
time
and
bitter
hard
work
when
your
education
is
no
further
advanced
than
the
cat's
when
you
are
merely
stuffing
yourself
with
a
mixed
up
mess
of
empty
names
and
random
incidents
and
elusive
dates
which
no
one
teaches
you
how
to
interpret
and
which
uninterpreted
pay
you
not
a
farthing's
value
for
your
waste
of
time
yes
i
think
he
had
to
get
up
at
halfpast
11
p
m
in
order
to
be
sure
to
be
perfect
with
his
history
lesson
by
noon
with
results
as
follows
from
a
calcutta
school
examination
q
who
was
cardinal
wolsey
cardinal
wolsey
was
an
editor
of
a
paper
named
north
briton
no
45
of
his
publication
he
charged
the
king
of
uttering
a
lie
from
the
throne
he
was
arrested
and
cast
into
prison
and
after
releasing
went
to
france
3
as
bishop
of
york
but
died
in
disentry
in
a
church
on
his
way
to
be
blockheaded
8
cardinal
wolsey
was
the
son
of
edward
iv
after
his
father's
death
he
himself
ascended
the
throne
at
the
age
of
10
ten
only
but
when
he
surpassed
or
when
he
was
fallen
in
his
twenty
years
of
age
at
that
time
he
wished
to
make
a
journey
in
his
countries
under
him
but
he
was
opposed
by
his
mother
to
do
journey
and
according
to
his
mother's
example
he
remained
in
the
home
and
then
became
king
after
many
times
obstacles
and
many
confusion
he
become
king
and
afterwards
his
brother
there
is
probably
not
a
word
of
truth
in
that
q
what
is
the
meaning
of
'ich
dien'
10
an
honor
conferred
on
the
first
or
eldest
sons
of
english
sovereigns
it
is
nothing
more
than
some
feathers
11
ich
dien
was
the
word
which
was
written
on
the
feathers
of
the
blind
king
who
came
to
fight
being
interlaced
with
the
bridles
of
the
horse
13
ich
dien
is
a
title
given
to
henry
vii
by
the
pope
of
rome
when
he
forwarded
the
reformation
of
cardinal
wolsy
to
rome
and
for
this
reason
he
was
called
commander
of
the
faith
a
dozen
or
so
of
this
kind
of
insane
answers
are
quoted
in
the
book
from
that
examination
each
answer
is
sweeping
proof
all
by
itself
that
the
person
uttering
it
was
pushed
ahead
of
where
he
belonged
when
he
was
put
into
history
proof
that
he
had
been
put
to
the
task
of
acquiring
history
before
he
had
had
a
single
lesson
in
the
art
of
acquiring
it
which
is
the
equivalent
of
dumping
a
pupil
into
geometry
before
he
has
learned
the
progressive
steps
which
lead
up
to
it
and
make
its
acquirement
possible
those
calcutta
novices
had

were

she

when
she

no

a

the
students
were
examined
in
the
following
bulky
matters
geometry
the
solar
spectrum
the
habeas
corpus
act
the
british
parliament
and
in
metaphysics
they
were
asked
to
trace
the
progress
of
skepticism
from
descartes
to
hume
it
is
within
bounds
to
say
that
some
of
the
results
were
astonishing
without
doubt
there
were
students
present
who
justified
their
teacher's
wisdom
in
introducing
them
to
these
studies
but
the
fact
is
also
evident
that
others
had
been
pushed
into
these
studies
to
waste
their
time
over
them
when
they
could
have
been
profitably
employed
in
hunting
smaller
game
under
the
head
of
geometry
one
of
the
answers
is
this
49
the
whole
bd
=
the
whole
ca
and
so
so
so
so
so
so
so
to
me
this
is
cloudy
but
i
was
never
well
up
in
geometry
that
was
the
only
effort
made
among
the
five
students
who
appeared
for
examination
in
geometry
the
other
four
wailed
and
surrendered
without
a
fight
they
are
piteous
wails
too
wails
of
despair
and
one
of
them
is
an
eloquent
reproach
it
comes
from
a
poor
fellow
who
has
been
laden
beyond
his
strength
by
a
stupid
teacher
and
is
eloquent
in
spite
of
the
poverty
of
its
english

poor

himself

if
i

sir
which
sir
isaac

and
other
experienced
mathematicians
cannot
understand
i
being
third
of
entrance
class
can
understand
these
which
is
too
impossible
to
imagine
and
my
examiner
also
has
put
very
tiresome
and
very
heavy
propositions
to
prove
we
must
remember
that
these
pupils
had
to
do
their
thinking
in
one
language
and
express
themselves
in
another
and
alien
one
it
was
a
heavy
handicap
i
have

a

verses
of

into

you
will
have
to
concede
that
he
did
it
the
man
who
rode

performed
the
whip
and
an
instrument
made
of

alone
with
strong
ardor
not

the
following
paragraph
is
from
a
little
book
which
is
famous
in
india
the
biography
of
a
distinguished
hindoo
judge
onoocool
chunder
mookerjee
it
was
written
by
his
nephew
and
is
unintentionally
funny
in
fact
exceedingly
so
i
offer
here
the
closing
scene
if
you
would
like
to
sample
the
rest
of
the
book
it
can
be
had
by
applying
to
the
publishers
messrs
thacker
spink
&
co
calcutta
and
having
said
these
words
he
hermetically
sealed
his
lips
not
to
open
them
again
all
the
well
known
doctors
of

that
could
be
procured
for
a
man

it
proved
after
all
as
if
to
milk

had
not
the
mournful
consolation

again
ideal
the
difference
between
a
river
and
the
sea
is
that
the
river
looks
fluid
the
sea
solid
usually
looks
as
if
you
could
step
out
and
walk
on
it
the
captain
has
this
peculiarity
he
cannot
tell
the
truth
in
a
plausible
way
in
this
he
is
the
very
opposite
of
the
austere
scot
who
sits
midway
of
the
table
he
cannot
tell
a
lie
in
an
unplausible
way
when
the
captain
finishes
a
statement
the
passengers
glance
at
each
other
privately
as
who
should
say
do
you
believe
that
when
the
scot
finishes
one
the
look
says
how
strange
and
interesting
the
whole
secret
is
in
the
manner
and
method
of
the
two
men
the
captain
is
a
little
shy
and
diffident
and
he
states
the
simplest
fact
as
if
he
were
a
little
afraid
of
it
while
the
scot
delivers
himself
of
the
most
abandoned
lie
with
such
an
air
of
stern
veracity
that
one
is
forced
to
believe
it
although
one
knows
it
isn't
so
for
instance
the
scot
told
about
a
pet
flying
fish
he
once
owned
that
lived
in
a
little
fountain
in
his
conservatory
and
supported
itself
by
catching
birds
and
frogs
and
rats
in
the
neighboring
fields
it
was
plain
that
no
one
at
the
table
doubted
this
statement
by
and
by
in
the
course
of
some
talk
about
custom
house
annoyances
the
captain
brought
out
the
following
simple
everyday
incident
but
through
his
infirmity
of
style
managed
to
tell
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
got
no
credence
he
said
i
went
ashore
at
naples
one
voyage
when
i
was
in
that
trade
and
stood
around
helping
my
passengers
for
i
could
speak
a
little
italian
two
or
three
times
at
intervals
the
officer
asked
me
if
i
had
anything
dutiable
about
me
and
seemed
more
and
more
put
out
and
disappointed
every
time
i
told
him
no
finally
a
passenger
whom
i
had
helped
through
asked
me
to
come
out
and
take
something
i
thanked
him
but
excused
myself
saying
i
had
taken
a
whisky
just
before
i
came
ashore
it
was
a
fatal
admission
the
officer
at
once
made
me
pay
sixpence
import
duty
on
the
whisky
just
from
ship
to
shore
you
see
and
he
fined
me
l5
for
not
declaring
the
goods
another
l5
for
falsely
denying
that
i
had
anything
dutiable
about
me
also
l5
for
concealing
the
goods
and
l50
for
smuggling
which
is
the
maximum
penalty
for
unlawfully
bringing
in
goods
under
the
value
of
sevenpence
ha'penny
altogether
sixty
five
pounds
sixpence
for
a
little
thing
like
that
the
scot
is
always
believed
yet
he
never
tells
anything
but
lies
whereas
the
captain
is
never
believed
although
he
never
tells
a
lie
so
far
as
i
can
judge
if
he
should
say
his
uncle
was
a
male
person
he
would
probably
say
it
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
would
believe
it
at
the
same
time
the
scot
could
claim
that
he
had
a
female
uncle
and
not
stir
a
doubt
in
anybody's
mind
my
own
luck
has
been
curious
all
my
literary
life
i
never
could
tell
a
lie
that
anybody
would
doubt
nor
a
truth
that
anybody
would
believe
lots
of
pets
on
board
birds
and
things
in
these
far
countries
the
white
people
do
seem
to
run
remarkably
to
pets
our
host
in
cawnpore
had
a
fine
collection
of
birds
the
finest
we
saw
in
a
private
house
in
india
and
in
colombo
dr
murray's
great
compound
and
commodious
bungalow
were
well
populated
with
domesticated
company
from
the

frisky
little
squirrels
a
ceylon
mina
walking
sociably
about
the

a
small
green
parrot
that
whistled
a
single
urgent
note
of
call
without
motion
of
its
beak
also
chuckled
a
monkey
in
a
cage
on
the
back
veranda
and
some
more
out
in
the
trees
also
a
number
of
beautiful
macaws
in
the
trees
and
various
and
sundry
birds
and
animals
of
breeds
not
known
to
me
but
no
cat

have
liked

april

the
sea
is
a
mediterranean
blue
and
i
believe
that
that
is
about
the
divinest
color
known
to
nature
it
is
strange
and
fine
nature's
lavish
generosities
to
her
creatures
at
least
to
all
of
them
except
man
for
those
that
fly
she
has
provided
a
home
that
is
nobly
spacious
a
home
which
is
forty
miles
deep
and
envelops
the
whole
globe
and
has
not
an
obstruction
in
it
for
those
that
swim
she
has
provided
a
more
than
imperial
domain
a
domain
which
is
miles
deep
and
covers
four
fifths
of
the
globe
but
as
for
man
she
has
cut
him
off
with
the
mere
odds
and
ends
of
the
creation
she
has
given
him
the
thin
skin
the
meagre
skin
which
is
stretched
over
the
remaining
one
fifth
the
naked
bones
stick
up
through
it
in
most
places
on
the
one
half
of
this
domain
he
can
raise
snow
ice
sand
rocks
and
nothing
else
so
the
valuable
part
of
his
inheritance
really
consists
of
but
a
single
fifth
of
the
family
estate
and
out
of
it
he
has
to
grub
hard
to
get
enough
to
keep
him
alive
and
provide
kings
and
soldiers
and
powder
to
extend
the
blessings
of
civilization
with
yet
man
in
his
simplicity
and
complacency
and
inability
to
cipher
thinks
nature
regards
him
as
the
important
member
of
the
family
in
fact
her
favorite
surely
it
must
occur
to
even
his
dull
head
sometimes
that
she
has
a
curious
way
of
showing
it
afternoon
the
captain
has
been
telling
how
in
one
of
his
arctic
voyages
it
was
so
cold
that
the
mate's
shadow
froze
fast
to
the
deck
and
had
to
be
ripped
loose
by
main
strength
and
even
then
he
got
only
about
two
thirds
of
it
back
nobody
said
anything
and
the
captain
went
away
i
think
he
is
becoming
disheartened
also
to
be
fair
there
is
another
word
of
praise
due
to
this
ship's
library
it
contains
no
copy
of
the
vicar
of
wakefield
that
strange
menagerie
of
complacent
hypocrites
and
idiots
of
theatrical
cheap
john
heroes
and
heroines
who
are
always
showing
off
of
bad
people
who
are
not
interesting
and
good
people
who
are
fatiguing
a
singular
book
not
a
sincere
line
in
it
and
not
a
character
that
invites
respect
a
book
which
is
one
long
waste
pipe
discharge
of
goody
goody
puerilities
and
dreary
moralities
a
book
which
is
full
of
pathos
which
revolts
and
humor
which
grieves
the
heart
there
are
few
things
in
literature
that
are
more
piteous
more
pathetic
than
the
celebrated
humorous
incident
of
moses
and
the
spectacles
jane
austen's
books
too
are
absent
from
this
library
just
that
one
omission
alone
would
make

fairly
good

of

and
the
day
begins
i
do
not
know
how
a
day
could
be
more
reposeful
no
motion
a
level
blue
sea
nothing
in
sight
from
horizon
to
horizon
the
speed
of
the
ship
furnishes
a
cooling
breeze
there
is
no
mail
to
read
and
answer
no
newspapers
to
excite
you
no
telegrams
to
fret
you
or
fright
you
the
world
is
far
far
away
it
has
ceased
to
exist
for
you
seemed
a
fading
dream
along
in
the
first
days
has
dissolved
to
an
unreality
now
it
is
gone
from
your
mind
with
all
its
businesses
and
ambitions
its
prosperities
and
disasters
its
exultations
and
despairs
its
joys
and
griefs
and
cares
and
worries
they
are
no
concern
of
yours
any
more
they
have
gone
out
of
your
life
they
are
a
storm
which
has
passed
and
left
a
deep
calm
behind
the
people
group
themselves
about
the
decks
in
their
snowy
white
linen
and
read
smoke
sew
play
cards
talk
nap
and
so
on
in
other
ships
the
passengers
are
always
ciphering
about
when
they
are
going
to
arrive
out
in
these
seas
it
is
rare
very
rare
to
hear
that
subject
broached
in
other
ships
there
is
always
an
eager
rush
to
the
bulletin
board
at
noon
to
find
out
what
the
run
has
been
in
these
seas
the
bulletin
seems
to
attract
no
interest
i
have
seen
no
one
visit
it
in
thirteen
days
i
have
visited
it
only
once
then
i
happened
to
notice
the
figures
of
the
day's
run
on
that
day
there
happened
to
be
talk
at
dinner
about
the
speed
of
modern
ships
i
was
the
only
passenger
present
who
knew
this
ship's
gait
necessarily
the
atlantic
custom
of
betting
on
the
ship's
run
is
not
a
custom
here
nobody
ever
mentions
it
i
myself
am
wholly
indifferent
as
to
when
we
are
going
to
get
in
if
any
one
else
feels
interested
in
the
matter
he
has
not
indicated
it
in
my
hearing
if
i
had
my
way
we
should
never
get
in
at
all
this
sort
of
sea
life
is
charged
with
an
indestructible
charm
there
is
no
weariness
no
fatigue
no
worry
no
responsibility
no
work
no
depression
of
spirits
there
is
nothing
like
this
serenity
this
comfort
this
peace
this
deep
contentment
to
be
found
anywhere
on
land
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
sail
on
for
ever
and
never
go
to
live
on
the
solid
ground
again
one
of
kipling's
ballads
has
delivered
the
aspect
and
sentiment
of
this
bewitching
sea
correctly
the
injian
ocean
sets
an'
smiles
so
sof'
so
bright
so
bloomin'
blue
there
aren't
a
wave
for
miles
an'

it
turns
out
that
the
astronomical
apprentice
worked
off
a
section
of
the
milky
way
on
me
for
the
magellan
clouds
a
man
of
more
experience
in
the
business
showed
one
of
them
to
me
last
night
it
was
small
and
faint
and
delicate
and
looked
like
the
ghost
of
a
bunch
of
white
smoke
left
floating
in
the
sky
by
an
exploded
bombshell

went
ashore
in
the
forenoon
at
port
louis
a
little
town
but
with
the
largest
variety
of
nationalities
and
complexions
we
have
encountered
yet
french
english
chinese
arabs
africans
with
wool
blacks
with
straight
hair
east
indians
half
whites
quadroons
and
great
varieties
in
costumes
and
colors
took
the
train
for
curepipe
at
1
30
two
hours'
run
gradually
uphill
what
a
contrast
this
frantic
luxuriance
of
vegetation
with
the
arid
plains
of
india
these
architecturally
picturesque
crags
and
knobs
and
miniature
mountains
with
the
monotony
of
the
indian
dead
levels
a
native
pointed
out
a
handsome
swarthy
man
of
grave
and
dignified
bearing
and
said
in
an
awed
tone
that
is
so
and
so
has
held
office
of
one
sort
or
another
under
this
government
for
37
years
he
is
known
all
over
this
whole
island
and
in
the
other
countries
of
the
world
perhaps
who
knows
one
thing
is
certain
you
can
speak
his
name
anywhere
in
this
whole
island
and
you
will
find
not
one
grown
person
that
has
not
heard
it
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
be
so
celebrated
yet
look
at
him
it
makes
no
change
in
him
he
does
not
even
seem
to
know
it
curepipe
means
pincushion
or
pegtown
probably
sixteen
miles
two
hours
by
rail
from
port
louis
at
each
end
of
every
roof
and
on
the
apex
of
every
dormer
window
a
wooden
peg
two
feet
high
stands
up
in
some
cases
its
top
is
blunt
in
others
the
peg
is
sharp
and
looks
like
a
toothpick
the
passion
for
this
humble
ornament
is
universal
apparently
there
has
been
only
one
prominent
event
in
the
history
of
mauritius
and
that
one
didn't
happen
i
refer
to
the
romantic
sojourn
of
paul
and
virginia
here
it
was
that
story
that
made
mauritius
known
to
the
world
made
the
name
familiar
to
everybody
the
geographical
position
of
it
to
nobody
a
clergyman
was
asked
to
guess
what
was
in
a
box
on
a
table
it
was
a
vellum
fan
painted
with
the
shipwreck
and
was
one
of
virginia's

this
is
the
only
country
in
the
world
where
the
stranger
is
not
asked
how
do
you
like
this
place
this
is
indeed
a
large
distinction
here
the
citizen
does
the
talking
about
the
country
himself
the
stranger
is
not
asked
to
help
you
get
all
sorts
of
information
from
one
citizen
you
gather
the
idea
that
mauritius
was
made
first
and
then
heaven
and
that
heaven
was
copied
after
mauritius
another
one
tells
you
that
this
is
an
exaggeration
that
the
two
chief
villages
port
louis
and
curepipe
fall
short
of
heavenly
perfection
that
nobody
lives
in
port
louis
except
upon
compulsion
and
that
curepipe
is
the
wettest
and
rainiest
place
in
the
world
an
english
citizen
said
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
mauritius
was
used
by
the
french
as
a
basis
from
which
to
operate
against
england's
indian
merchantmen
so
england
captured
the
island
and
also
the
neighbor
bourbon
to
stop
that
annoyance
england
gave
bourbon
back
the
government
in
london
did
not
want
any
more
possessions
in
the
west
indies
if
the
government
had
had
a
better
quality
of
geography
in
stock
it
would
not
have
wasted
bourbon
in
that
foolish
way
a
big
war
will
temporarily
shut
up
the
suez
canal
some
day
and
the
english
ships
will
have
to
go
to
india
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
again
then
england
will
have
to
have
bourbon
and
will
take
it
mauritius
was
a
crown
colony
until
20
years
ago
with
a
governor
appointed
by
the
crown
and
assisted
by
a
council
appointed
by
himself
but
pope
hennessey
came
out
as
governor
then
and
he
worked
hard
to
get
a
part
of
the
council
made
elective
and
succeeded
so
now
the
whole
council
is
french
and
in
all
ordinary
matters
of
legislation
they
vote
together
and
in
the
french
interest
not
the
english
the
english
population
is
very
slender
it
has
not
votes
enough
to
elect
a
legislator
half
a
dozen
rich
french
families
elect
the
legislature
pope
hennessey
was
an
irishman
a
catholic
a
home
ruler
m
p
a
hater
of
england
and
the
english
a
very
troublesome
person
and
a
serious
incumbrance
at
westminster
so
it
was
decided
to
send
him
out
to
govern
unhealthy
countries
in
hope
that
something
would
happen
to
him
but
nothing
did
the
first
experiment
was
not
merely
a
failure
it
was
more
than
a
failure
he
proved
to
be
more
of
a
disease
himself
than
any
he
was
sent
to
encounter
the
next
experiment
was
here
the
dark
scheme
failed
again
it
was
an
off
season
and
there
was
nothing
but
measles
here
at
the
time
pope
hennessey's
health
was
not
affected
he
worked
with
the
french
and
for
the
french
and
against
the
english
and
he
made
the
english
very
tired
and
the
french
very
happy
and
lived
to
have
the
joy
of
seeing
the
flag
he
served
publicly
hissed
his
memory
is
held
in
worshipful
reverence
and
affection
by
the
french
it
is
a
land
of
extraordinary
quarantines
they
quarantine
a
ship
for
anything
or
for
nothing
quarantine
her
for
20
and
even
30
days
they
once
quarantined
a
ship
because
her
captain
had
had
the
smallpox
when
he
was
a
boy
that
and
because
he
was
english
the
population
is
very
small
small
to
insignificance
the
majority
is
east
indian
then
mongrels
then
negroes
descendants
of
the
slaves
of
the
french
times
then
french
then
english
there
was
an
american
but
he
is
dead
or
mislaid
the
mongrels
are
the
result
of
all
kinds
of
mixtures
black
and
white
mulatto
and
white
quadroon
and
white
octoroon
and
white
and
so
there
is
every
shade

you
wouldn't
expect
a
person
to
be
proud
of
being
a
mauritian
now
would
you
but
it
is
so
the
most
of
them
have
never
been
out
of
the
island
and
haven't
read
much
or
studied
much
and
they
think
the
world
consists
of
three
principal
countries
judaea
france
and
mauritius
so
they
are
very
proud
of
belonging
to
one
of
the
three
grand
divisions
of
the
globe
they
think
that
russia
and
germany
are
in
england
and
that
england
does
not
amount
to
much
they
have
heard
vaguely
about
the
united
states
and
the
equator
but
they
think
both
of
them
are
monarchies
they
think
mount
peter
botte
is
the
highest
mountain
in
the
world
and
if
you
show
one
of
them
a
picture
of
milan
cathedral
he
will
swell
up
with
satisfaction
and
say
that
the
idea
of
that
jungle
of
spires
was
stolen
from
the
forest
of
peg
tops
and
toothpicks
that
makes
the
roofs
of
curepipe
look
so
fine
and
prickly
there
is
not
much
trade
in
books
the
newspapers
educate
and
entertain
the
people
mainly
the
latter
they
have
two
pages
of
large
print
reading
matter
one
of
them
english
the
other
french
the
english
page
is
a
translation
of
the
french
one
the
typography
is
super
extra
primitive
in
this
quality
it
has
not
its
equal
anywhere
there
is
no
proof
reader
now
he
is
dead
where
do
they
get
matter
to
fill
up
a
page
in
this
little
island
lost
in
the
wastes
of
the
indian
ocean
oh
madagascar
they
discuss
madagascar
and
france
that
is
the
bulk
then
they
chock
up
the
rest
with
advice
to
the
government
also
slurs
upon
the
english
administration
the
papers
are
all
owned
and
edited
by
creoles
french
the
language
of
the
country
is

everybody
speaks
it
has
to
you
have
to
know
french
particularly

this
was
a
flourishing
country
in
former
days
for
it
made
then
and
still
makes
the
best
sugar
in
the
world
but
first
the
suez
canal
severed
it
from
the
world
and
left
it
out
in
the
cold
and
next
the
beetroot
sugar
helped
by
bounties
captured
the
european
markets
sugar
is
the
life
of
mauritius
and
it
is
losing
its
grip
its
downward
course
was
checked
by
the
depreciation
of
the
rupee
for
the
planter
pays
wages
in
rupees
but
sells
his
crop
for
gold
and
the
insurrection
in
cuba
and
paralyzation
of
the
sugar
industry
there
have
given
our
prices
here
a
life
saving
lift
but
the
outlook
has
nothing
permanently
favorable
about
it
it
takes
a
year
to
mature
the
canes
on
the
high
ground
three
and
six
months
longer
and
there
is
always
a
chance
that
the
annual
cyclone
will
rip
the
profit
out
of
the
crop
in
recent
times
a
cyclone
took
the
whole
crop
as
you
may
say
and
the
island
never
saw
a
finer
one
some
of
the
noblest
sugar
estates
in
the
island
are
in
deep
difficulties
a
dozen
of
them
are
investments
of
english
capital
and
the
companies
that
own
them
are
at
work
now
trying
to
settle
up
and
get
out
with
a
saving
of
half
the
money
they
put
in
you
know
in
these
days
when
a
country
begins
to
introduce
the
tea
culture
it
means
that
its
own
specialty
has
gone
back
on
it
look
at
bengal
look
at
ceylon
well
they've
begun
to
introduce
the
tea
culture
here
many
copies
of
paul
and
virginia
are
sold
every
year
in

no
other
book
is
so
popular
here
except
the
bible
by
many
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
part
of
the
bible
all
the
missionaries
work
up
their
french
on
it
when
they
come
here
to
pervert
the
catholic
mongrel
it
is

that
was

like
the

the
laying

why
did

large
part
of
the
official
duty
of
these
cabinets
is
to
keep
an
eye
on
each
other's
wash

grab
what
they
can
of
it
as
opportunity
offers
all
the
territorial
possessions
of
all
the
political
establishments
in
the
earth
including
america

consist
of
pilferings
from

no
tribe
howsoever
insignificant
and
no
nation
howsoever
mighty
occupies
a
foot
of
land
that
was
not
stolen
when
the
english
the
french
and
the
spaniards
reached
america
the
indian
tribes
had
been
raiding
each
other's
territorial
clothes
lines
for
ages
and
every
acre
of
ground
in
the
continent
had
been
stolen
and
re
stolen
500
times
the
english
the
french
and
the
spaniards
went
to
work
and
stole
it
all
over
again
and
when
that
was
satisfactorily
accomplished
they
went
diligently
to
work
and
stole
it
from
each
other
in
europe
and
asia
and
africa
every
acre
of
ground
has
been
stolen
several
millions
of
times
a
crime
persevered
in
a
thousand
centuries
ceases
to
be
a
crime
and
becomes
a
virtue
this
is
the
law
of
custom
and
custom
supersedes
all
other
forms
of
law
christian
governments
are
as
frank
to
day
as
open
and
above
board
in
discussing
projects
for
raiding
each
other's
clothes
lines
as
ever
they
were
before
the
golden
rule

smiling
into
this
inhospitable
world
and

years
england
has
beneficently
retired
garment
after
garment
from
the
indian
lines
until
there
is
hardly
a
rag
of
the
original
wash
left
dangling
anywhere
in
800
years
an
obscure
tribe
of
muscovite
savages
has
risen
to
the
dazzling
position
of
land
robber
in
chief
she
found
a
quarter
of
the
world
hanging
out
to
dry
on
a
hundred
parallels
of
latitude
and
she
scooped
in
the
whole
wash
she
keeps
a
sharp
eye
on
a
multitude
of
little
lines
that
stretch
along
the
northern
boundaries
of
india
and
every
now
and
then
she
snatches
a
hip
rag
or
a
pair
of
pyjamas
it
is
england's
prospective
property
and
russia
knows
it
but
russia
cares
nothing
for
that
in
fact
in
our
day
land
robbery
claim
jumping
is
become
a
european
governmental
frenzy
some
have
been
hard
at
it
in
the
borders
of
china
in
burma
in
siam
and
the
islands
of
the
sea
and
all
have
been
at
it
in
africa
africa
has
been
as
coolly
divided
up
and
portioned
out
among
the
gang
as
if
they
had
bought
it
and
paid
for
it
and
now
straightway
they
are
beginning
the
old
game
again
to
steal
each
other's
grabbings
germany
found
a
vast
slice
of
central
africa
with
the
english
flag
and
the
english
missionary
and
the
english
trader
scattered
all
over
it
but
with
certain
formalities
neglected
no
signs
up
keep
off
the
grass
trespassers
forbidden
etc
and
she
stepped
in
with
a
cold
calm
smile
and
put
up
the
signs
herself
and
swept
those
english
pioneers
promptly
out
of
the
country
there
is
a
tremendous
point
there
it
can
be
put
into
the
form
of
a
maxim
get
your
formalities
right
never
mind
about
the
moralities
it
was
an
impudent
thing
but
england
had
to
put
up
with
it
now
in
the
case
of
madagascar
the
formalities
had
originally
been
observed
but
by
neglect
they
had
fallen
into
desuetude
ages
ago
england
should
have
snatched
madagascar
from
the
french
clothes
line
without
an
effort
she
could
have
saved
those
harmless
natives
from
the
calamity
of
french
civilization
and
she
did
not
do
it
now
it
is
too
late
the
signs
of
the
times
show
plainly
enough
what
is
going
to
happen
all
the
savage
lands
in
the
world
are
going
to
be
brought
under
subjection
to
the
christian
governments
of
europe
i
am
not
sorry
but
glad
this
coming
fate
might
have
been
a
calamity
to
those
savage
peoples
two
hundred
years
ago
but
now
it
will
in
some
cases
be
a
benefaction
the
sooner
the
seizure
is
consummated
the
better
for
the
savages
the
dreary
and
dragging
ages
of
bloodshed
and
disorder
and
oppression
will
give
place
to
peace
and
order
and
the
reign
of
law
when
one
considers
what
india
was
under
her
hindoo
and
mohammedan
rulers
and
what
she
is
now
when
he
remembers
the
miseries
of
her
millions
then
and
the
protections
and
humanities
which
they
enjoy
now
he
must
concede
that
the
most
fortunate
thing
that
has
ever
befallen
that
empire
was
the
establishment
of
british
supremacy
there
the
savage
lands
of
the
world
are
to
pass
to
alien
possession
their
peoples
to
the
mercies
of
alien
rulers
let
us
hope
and
believe
that
they
will
all
benefit
by
the

there's

the

suddenly
all
perdition
broke
loose
again
while
people
were
rushing
around
seeking

the
noise
was
comparable
to
nothing
there
is
nothing
resembling
it
but
thunder
and
cannon
and
these
are
feeble
in
comparison
what
there
is
of
mauritius
is
beautiful
you
have
undulating
wide
expanses
of
sugar
cane
a
fine
fresh
green
and
very
pleasant
to
the
eye
and
everywhere
else
you
have
a
ragged
luxuriance
of
tropic
vegetation
of
vivid
greens
of
varying
shades
a
wild
tangle
of
underbrush
with
graceful
tall
palms
lifting
their
crippled
plumes
high
above
it
and
you
have
stretches
of
shady
dense
forest
with
limpid
streams
frolicking
through
them
continually
glimpsed
and
lost
and
glimpsed
again
in
the
pleasantest
hide
and
seek
fashion
and
you
have
some
tiny
mountains
some
quaint
and
picturesque
groups
of
toy
peaks
and
a
dainty
little
vest
pocket
matterhorn
and
here
and
there
and
now
and
then
a
strip
of
sea
with
a
white
ruffle
of
surf
breaks
into
the
view
that
is
mauritius
and
pretty
enough
the
details
are
few
the
massed
result
is
charming
but
not
imposing
not
riotous
not
exciting
it
is
a
sunday
landscape
perspective
and
the
enchantments
wrought
by
distance
are
wanting
there
are
no
distances
there
is
no
perspective
so
to
speak
fifteen
miles
as
the
crow
flies
is
the
usual
limit
of
vision
mauritius
is
a
garden
and
a
park
combined
it
affects
one's
emotions
as
parks
and
gardens
affect
them
the
surfaces
of
one's
spiritual
deeps
are
pleasantly
played
upon
the

domes

the
things

exalt

between

sailing
straight

for
delagoa
bay
last
night
the
burly
chief
engineer
middle
aged
was
standing
telling
a
spirited
seafaring
tale
and
had
reached
the
most
exciting
place
where
a
man
overboard
was
washing
swiftly
astern
on
the
great
seas
and
uplifting
despairing
cries
everybody
racing
aft
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
and
fading
hope
when
the
band
which
had
been
silent
a
moment
began
impressively
its
closing
piece
the
english
national
anthem
as
simply
as
if
he
was
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
he
stopped
his
story
uncovered
laid
his
laced
cap
against
his
breast
and
slightly
bent
his
grizzled
head
the
few
bars
finished
he
put
on
his
cap
and
took
up
his
tale
again
as
naturally
as
if
that
interjection
of
music
had
been
a
part
of
it
there
was
something
touching
and
fine
about
it
and
it
was
moving
to
reflect
that
he
was
one
of
a
myriad
scattered
over
every
part
of
the
globe
who
by
turn
was
doing
as
he
was
doing
every
hour
of
the
twenty
four
those
awake
doing
it
while
the
others
slept
those
impressive
bars
forever
floating
up
out
of
the
various
climes
never
silent
and
never
lacking
reverent
listeners
all
that
i
remember
about
madagascar
is
that
thackeray's
little
billie
went
up
to
the
top
of

there

from

sat
up
singing
on
the
afterdeck
in
the
moonlight
till

a
m
good
fun
and
wholesome
and
the
songs
were
clean
songs
and
some
of
them
were
hallowed
by
tender
associations
finally
in
a
pause
a
man
asked
have
you
heard
about
the
fellow
that
kept
a
diary
crossing
the
atlantic
it
was
a
discord
a
wet
blanket
the
men
were
not
in
the
mood
for
humorous
dirt
the
songs
had
carried
them
to
their
homes
and
in
spirit
they
sat
by
those
far
hearthstones
and
saw
faces
and
heard
voices
other
than
those
that
were
about
them
and
so
this
disposition
to
drag
in
an
old
indecent
anecdote
got
no
welcome
nobody
answered
the
poor
man
hadn't
wit
enough
to
see
that
he
had
blundered
but
asked
his
question
again
again
there
was
no
response
it
was
embarrassing
for
him
in
his
confusion
he
chose
the
wrong
course
did
the
wrong
thing
began
the
anecdote
began
it
in
a
deep
and
hostile
stillness
where
had
been
such
life
and
stir
and
warm
comradeship
before
he
delivered
himself
of
the
brief
details
of
the
diary's
first
day
and
did
it
with
some
confidence
and
a
fair
degree
of
eagerness
it
fell
flat
there
was
an
awkward
pause
the
two
rows
of
men
sat
like
statues
there
was
no
movement
no
sound
he
had
to
go
on
there
was
no
other
way
at
least
none
that
an
animal
of
his
calibre
could
think
of
at
the
close
of
each
day's
diary
the
same
dismal
silence
followed
when
at
last
he
finished
his
tale
and
sprung
the
indelicate
surprise
which
is
wont
to
fetch
a
crash
of
laughter
not
a
ripple
of
sound
resulted
it
was
as
if
the
tale
had
been
told
to
dead
men
after
what
seemed
a
long
long
time
somebody
sighed
somebody
else
stirred
in
his
seat
presently
the
men
dropped
into
a
low
murmur
of
confidential
talk
each
with
his
neighbor
and
the
incident
was
closed
there
were
indications
that
that
man
was
fond
of
his
anecdote
that
it
was
his
pet
his
standby
his
shot
that
never
missed
his
reputation
maker
but
he
will
never
tell
it
again
no
doubt
he
will
think
of
it
sometimes
for
that
cannot
well
be
helped
and
then
he
will
see
a
picture
and
always
the
same
picture
the
double
rank
of
dead
men
the
vacant
deck
stretching
away
in
dimming
perspective
beyond
them
the
wide
desert
of
smooth
sea
all
abroad
the
rim
of
the
moon
spying
from
behind
a
rag
of
black
cloud
the
remote
top
of
the
mizzenmast
shearing
a
zigzag
path
through
the
fields
of
stars
in
the
deeps
of
space
and
this
soft
picture
will
remind
him
of
the
time
that
he
sat
in
the
midst
of
it
and
told
his
poor
little
tale
and
felt
so
lonesome
when
he
got
through
fifty
indians
and
chinamen
asleep
in
a
big
tent
in
the
waist
of
the
ship
forward
they
lie
side
by
side
with
no
space
between
the
former
wrapped
up
head
and
all
as
in
the
indian
streets
the
chinamen
uncovered
the
lamp
and
things
for
opium
smoking
in
the
center
a
passenger
said
it
was

very

winter
the
south
african
winter
is
just
beginning
now
but
nobody
but
an
expert
can
tell
it
from
summer
however
i
am
tired
of
summer
we
have
had
it
unbroken
for
eleven
months
we
spent
the
afternoon
on
shore
delagoa
bay
a
small
town
no
sights
no
carriages
three
'rickshas
but
we
couldn't
get
them
apparently
private
these
portuguese
are
a
rich
brown
like
some
of
the
indians
some
of
the
blacks
have
the
long
horse
beads
and
very
long
chins
of
the
negroes
of
the
picture
books
but
most
of
them
are
exactly
like
the
negroes
of
our
southern
states
round
faces
flat
noses
good
natured
and
easy
laughers
flocks
of
black
women
passed
along
carrying
outrageously
heavy
bags
of
freight
on
their
heads
the
quiver
of
their
leg
as
the
foot
was
planted
and
the
strain
exhibited
by
their
bodies
showed
what
a
tax
upon
their
strength
the
load
was
they
were
stevedores
and
doing
full
stevedores
work
they
were
very
erect
when
unladden
from
carrying
heavy
loads
on
their
heads
just
like
the
indian
women
it
gives
them
a
proud
fine
carriage
sometimes
one
saw
a
woman
carrying
on
her
head
a
laden
and
top
heavy
basket
the
shape
of
an
inverted
pyramid
its
top
the
size
of
a
soup
plate
its
base
the
diameter
of
a
teacup
it
required
nice
balancing
and
got
it
no
bright
colors
yet
there
were
a
good
many
hindoos
the
second
class
passenger
came
over
as
usual
at
lights
out
11
and
we
lounged
along
the
spacious
vague
solitudes
of
the
deck
and
smoked
the
peaceful
pipe
and
talked
he
told
me
an
incident
in
mr
barnum's
life
which
was
evidently
characteristic
of
that
great
showman
in
several
ways
this
was
barnum's
purchase
of
shakespeare's
birthplace
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
the
second
class
passenger
was
in
jamrach's
employ
at
the
time
and
knew
barnum
well
he
said
the
thing
began
in
this
way
one
morning
barnum
and
jamrach
were
in
jamrach's
little
private
snuggery
back
of
the
wilderness
of
caged
monkeys
and
snakes
and
other
commonplaces
of
jamrach's
stock
in
trade
refreshing
themselves
after
an
arduous
stroke
of
business
jamrach
with
something
orthodox
barnum
with
something
heterodox
for
barnum
was
a
teetotaler
the
stroke
of
business
was
in
the
elephant
line
jamrach
had
contracted
to
deliver
to
barnum
in
new
york
18
elephants
for
$360
000
in
time
for
the
next
season's
opening
then
it
occurred
to
mr
barnum
that
he
needed
a
card
he
suggested
jumbo
jamrach
said
he
would
have
to
think
of
something
else
jumbo
couldn't
be
had
the
zoo
wouldn't
part
with
that
elephant
barnum
said
he
was
willing
to
pay
a
fortune
for
jumbo
if
he
could
get
him
jamrach
said
it
was
no
use
to
think
about
it
that
jumbo
was
as
popular
as
the
prince
of
wales
and
the
zoo
wouldn't
dare
to
sell
him
all
england
would
be
outraged
at
the
idea
jumbo
was
an
english
institution
he
was
part
of
the
national
glory
one
might
as
well
think
of
buying
the
nelson
monument
barnum
spoke
up
with
vivacity
and
said
it's
a
first
rate
idea
i'll
buy
the
monument
jamrach
was
speechless
for
a
second
then
he
said
like
one
ashamed
you
caught
me
i
was
napping
for
a
moment
i
thought
you
were
in
earnest
barnum
said
pleasantly
i
was
in
earnest
i
know
they
won't
sell
it
but
no
matter
i
will
not
throw
away
a
good
idea
for
all
that
all
i
want
is
a
big
advertisement
i
will
keep
the
thing
in
mind
and
if
nothing
better
turns
up
i
will
offer
to
buy
it
that
will
answer
every
purpose
it
will
furnish
me
a
couple
of
columns
of
gratis
advertising
in
every
english
and
american
paper
for
a
couple
of
months
and
give
my
show
the
biggest
boom
a
show
ever
had
in
this
world
jamrach
started
to
deliver
a
burst
of
admiration
but
was
interrupted
by
barnum
who
said
here
is
a
state
of
things!
england
ought
to
blush
his
eye
had
fallen
upon
something
in
the
newspaper
he
read
it
through
to
himself
then
read
it
aloud
it
said
that
the
house
that
shakespeare
was
born
in
at
stratford
on
avon
was
falling
gradually
to
ruin
through
neglect
that
the
room
where
the
poet
first
saw
the
light
was
now
serving
as
a
butcher's
shop
that
all
appeals
to
england
to
contribute
money
the
requisite
sum
stated
to
buy
and
repair
the
house
and
place
it
in
the
care
of
salaried
and
trustworthy
keepers
had
fallen
resultless
then
barnum
said
there's
my
chance
let
jumbo
and
the
monument
alone
for
the
present
they'll
keep
i'll
buy
shakespeare's
house
i'll
set
it
up
in
my
museum
in
new
york
and
put
a
glass
case
around
it
and
make
a
sacred
thing
of
it
and
you'll
see
all
america
flock
there
to
worship
yes
and
pilgrims
from
the
whole
earth
and
i'll
make
them
take
their
hats
off
too
in
america
we
know
how
to
value
anything
that
shakespeare's
touch
has
made
holy
you'll
see
in
conclusion
the
s
c
p
said
that
is
the
way
the
thing
came
about
barnum
did
buy
shakespeare's
house
he
paid
the
price
asked
and
received
the
properly
attested
documents
of
sale
then
there
was
an
explosion
i
can
tell
you
england
rose!
that
the
birthplace
of
the
master
genius
of
all
the
ages
and
all
the
climes
that
priceless
possession
of
britain
to
be
carted
out
of
the
country
like
so
much
old
lumber
and
set
up
for
sixpenny
desecration
in
a
yankee
show
shop
the
idea
was
not
to
be
tolerated
for
a
moment
england
rose
in
her
indignation
and
barnum
was
glad
to
relinquish
his
prize
and
offer
apologies
however
he
stood
out
for
a
compromise
he
claimed
a
concession
england
must
let
him
have
jumbo
and
england
consented
but
not
cheerfully
it
shows
how
by
help
of
time
a
story
can
grow
even
after
barnum
has
had
the
first
innings
in
the
telling
of
it
mr
barnum
told
me
the
story
himself
years
ago
he
said
that
the
permission
to
buy
jumbo
was
not
a
concession
the
purchase
was
made
and
the
animal
delivered
before
the
public
knew
anything
about
it
also
that
the
securing
of
jumbo
was
all
the
advertisement
he
needed
it
produced
many
columns
of
newspaper
talk
free
of
cost
and
he
was
satisfied
he
said
that
if
he
had
failed
to
get
jumbo
he
would
have
caused
his
notion
of
buying
the
nelson
monument
to
be
treacherously
smuggled
into
print
by
some
trusty
friend
and
after
he
had
gotten
a
few
hundred
pages
of
gratuitous
advertising
out
of
it
he
would
have
come
out
with
a
blundering
obtuse
but
warm
hearted
letter
of
apology
and
in
a
postscript
to
it
would
have
naively
proposed
to
let
the
monument
go
and
take
stonehenge
in
place
of
it
at
the
same
price
it
was
his
opinion
that
such
a
letter
written
with
well
simulated
asinine
innocence
and
gush
would
have
gotten
his
ignorance
and
stupidity
an
amount
of
newspaper
abuse
worth
six
fortunes
to
him
and
not
purchasable
for
twice
the
money
i
knew
mr
barnum
well
and
i
placed
every
confidence
in
the
account
which
he
gave
me
of
the
shakespeare
birthplace
episode
he
said
he
found
the
house
neglected
and
going
to
decay
and
he
inquired
into
the
matter
and
was
told
that
many
times
earnest
efforts
had
been
made
to
raise
money
for
its
proper
repair
and
preservation
but
without
success
he
then
proposed
to
buy
it
the
proposition
was
entertained
and
a
price
named
$50
000
i
think
but
whatever
it
was
barnum
paid
the
money
down
without
remark
and
the
papers
were
drawn
up
and
executed
he
said
that
it
had
been
his
purpose
to
set
up
the
house
in
his
museum
keep
it
in
repair
protect
it
from
name
scribblers
and
other
desecrators
and
leave
it
by
bequest
to
the
safe
and
perpetual
guardianship
of
the
smithsonian
institute
at
washington
but
as
soon
as
it
was
found
that
shakespeare's
house
had
passed
into
foreign
hands
and
was
going
to
be
carried
across
the
ocean
england
was
stirred
as
no
appeal
from
the
custodians
of
the
relic
had
ever
stirred
england
before
and
protests
came
flowing
in
and
money
too
to
stop
the
outrage
offers
of
repurchase
were
made
offers
of
double
the
money
that
mr
barnum
had
paid
for
the
house
he
handed
the
house
back
but
took
only
the
sum
which
it
had
cost
him
but
on
the
condition
that
an
endowment
sufficient
for
the
future
safeguarding
and
maintenance
of
the
sacred
relic
should
be
raised
this
condition
was
fulfilled
that
was
barnum's
account
of
the
episode
and
to
the
end
of
his
days
he
claimed
with
pride
and
satisfaction
that
not
england
but
america
represented
by
him

birthplace
of

when

takes

like

for

and

like

that
have

project
from

i
have
ever

anywhere
except
approaching
darjeeling
have
not
heard
anyone
call
natal
the

of
south
africa
but
that
is
what
it
probably
is
it
was
when
bishop
of
natal
that
colenso
raised
such
a
storm
in
the
religious
world
the
concerns
of
religion
are
a
vital
matter
here
yet
a
vigilant
eye
is
kept
upon
sunday
museums
and
other
dangerous
resorts
are
not
allowed
to
be
open
you
may
sail
on
the
bay
but
it
is
wicked
to
play
cricket
for
a
while
a
sunday
concert
was
tolerated
upon
condition
that
it
must
be
admission
free
and
the
money
taken
by
collection
but
the
collection
was
alarmingly
large
and
that
stopped
the
matter
they
are
particular
about
babies
a
clergyman
would
not
bury
a
child
according
to
the
sacred
rites
because
it
had
not
been
baptized
the
hindoo
is
more
liberal
he
burns
no
child
under
three
holding
that
it
does
not
need
purifying
the
king
of
the

a
fine
fellow
of

was
banished
six
years

for
a
term
of
seven
years
he
is
occupying
napoleon's

the
people
are
a
little
nervous
about
having
him
come
back

they
may
well
be

there
is
a
large
trappist
monastery
two
hours
from
durban
over
the
country
roads
and
in
company
with
mr
milligan
and
mr
hunter
general
manager
of
the
natal
government
railways
who
knew
the
heads
of
it
we
went
out
to
see
it
there
it
all
was
just
as
one
reads
about
it
in
books
and
cannot
believe
that
it
is
so
i
mean
the
rough
hard
work
the
impossible
hours
the
scanty
food
the
coarse
raiment
the
maryborough
beds
the
tabu
of
human
speech
of
social
intercourse
of
relaxation
of
amusement
of
entertainment
of
the
presence
of
woman
in
the
men's
establishment
there
it
all
was
it
was
not
a
dream
it
was
not
a
lie
and
yet
with
the
fact
before
one's
face
it
was
still
incredible
it
is
such
a
sweeping
suppression
of
human
instincts
such
an
extinction
of
the
man
as
an
individual
la
trappe
must
have
known
the
human
race
well
the
scheme
which
he
invented
hunts
out
everything
that
a
man
wants
and
values
and
withholds
it
from
him
apparently
there
is
no
detail
that
can
help
make
life
worth
living
that
has
not
been
carefully
ascertained
and
placed
out
of
the
trappist's
reach
la
trappe
must
have
known
that
there
were
men
who
would
enjoy
this
kind
of
misery
but
how
did
he
find
it
out
if
he
had
consulted
you
or
me
he
would
have
been
told
that
his
scheme
lacked
too
many
attractions
that
it
was
impossible
that
it
could
never
be
floated
but
there
in
the
monastery
was
proof
that
he
knew
the
human
race
better
than
it
knew
itself
he
set
his
foot
upon
every
desire
that
a
man
has
yet
he
floated
his
project
and
it
has
prospered
for
two
hundred
years
and
will
go
on
prospering
forever
no
doubt
man
likes
personal
distinction
there
in
the
monastery
it
is
obliterated
he
likes
delicious
food
there
he
gets
beans
and
bread
and
tea
and
not
enough
of
it
he
likes
to
lie
softly
there
he
lies
on
a
sand
mattress
and
has
a
pillow
and
a
blanket
but
no
sheet
when
he
is
dining
in
a
great
company
of
friends
he
likes
to
laugh
and
chat
there
a
monk
reads
a
holy
book
aloud
during
meals
and
nobody
speaks
or
laughs
when
a
man
has
a
hundred
friends
about
him

be
likes
to
have
a
good
time
and
run
late
there
he
and
the
rest
go
silently
to

at

and
in

dark
too
there
is

a
loose

to
discard
there
are
no
night
clothes
to
put

not

man
likes
to

there
he
gets
up
once
or
twice
in

night
to
perform

and
gets
up
finally
for
the

at

in

man
likes

none
at

there
he
labors
all

in

field
or
in
the
blacksmith
shop
or
the
other
shops
devoted
to
the
mechanical
trades
such
as
shoemaking
saddlery
carpentry
and
so
on
man
likes
the
society
of
girls
and
women
there
he
never
has
it
he
likes
to
have
his
children
about
him
and
pet
them
and
play
with
them
there
he
has
none
he
likes
billiards
there
is
no

there
he
likes
outdoor

and
indoor
dramatic
and
musical
and
social
entertainments
there
are
none
there
he
likes
to
bet
on
things
i
was
told
that
betting
is
forbidden
there
when
a
man's
temper
is
up
he
likes
to
pour
it
out
upon
somebody
there
this
is
not
allowed
a
man
likes
animals
pets
there
are
none
there
he
likes
to
smoke
there
he
cannot
do
it
he
likes
to
read
the
news
no
papers
or
magazines
come
there
a
man
likes
to
know
how
his
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
are
getting
along
when
he
is
away
and
if
they
miss
him
there
he
cannot
know
a
man
likes
a
pretty
house
and
pretty
furniture
and
pretty
things
and
pretty
colors
there
he
has
nothing
but
naked
aridity
and
sombre
colors
a
man
likes
name
it
yourself
whatever
it
is
it
is
absent
from
that
place
from
what
i
could
learn
all
that
a
man
gets
for
this
is
merely
the
saving
of
his
soul
it
all
seems
strange
incredible
impossible
but
la
trappe
knew
the
race
he
knew
the
powerful
attraction
of
unattractiveness
he
knew
that
no
life
could
be
imagined
howsoever
comfortless
and
forbidding
but
somebody
would
want
to
try
it

transvaal
politics
in
a
confused
condition
first
the
sentencing
of
the
johannesburg
reformers
startled
england
by
its
severity
on
the
top
of
this
came
kruger's
exposure
of
the
cipher
correspondence
which
showed
that
the
invasion
of
the
transvaal
with
the
design
of
seizing
that
country
and
adding
it
to
the
british
empire
was
planned
by
cecil
rhodes
and
beit
which
made
a
revulsion
in
english
feeling
and
brought
out
a
storm
against
rhodes
and
the
chartered
company
for
degrading
british
honor
for
a
good
while
i
couldn't
seem
to
get
at
a
clear
comprehension
of
it
it
was
so
tangled
but
at
last
by
patient
study
i
have
managed
it
i
believe
as
i
understand
it
the
uitlanders
and
other
dutchmen
were
dissatisfied
because
the
english
would
not
allow
them
to
take
any
part
in
the
government
except
to
pay
taxes
next
as
i
understand
it
dr
kruger
and
dr
jameson
not
having
been
able
to
make
the
medical
business
pay
made
a
raid
into
matabeleland
with
the
intention
of
capturing
the
capital
johannesburg
and
holding
the
women
and
children
to
ransom
until
the
uitlanders
and
the
other
boers
should
grant
to
them
and
the
chartered
company
the
political
rights
which
had
been
withheld
from
them
they
would
have
succeeded
in
this
great
scheme
as
i
understand
it
but
for
the
interference
of
cecil
rhodes
and
mr
beit
and
other
chiefs
of
the
matabele
who
persuaded
their
countrymen
to
revolt
and
throw
off
their
allegiance
to
germany
this
in
turn
as
i
understand
it
provoked
the
king
of
abyssinia
to
destroy
the
italian
army
and
fall
back
upon
johannesburg

at
the
instigation
of

pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
when
i
scribbled
in
my
note
book
a
year
ago
the
paragraph
which
ends
the
preceding
chapter
it
was
meant
to
indicate
in
an
extravagant
form
two
things
the
conflicting
nature
of
the
information
conveyed
by
the
citizen
to
the
stranger
concerning
south
african
politics
and
the
resulting
confusion
created
in
the
stranger's
mind
thereby
but
it
does
not
seem
so
very
extravagant
now
nothing
could
in
that
disturbed
and
excited
time
make
south
african
politics
clear
or
quite
rational
to
the
citizen
of
the
country
because
his
personal
interest
and
his
political
prejudices
were
in
his
way
and
nothing
could
make
those
politics
clear
or
rational
to
the
stranger
the
sources
of
his
information
being
such
as
they
were
i
was
in
south
africa
some
little
time
when
i
arrived
there
the
political
pot
was
boiling
fiercely
four
months
previously
jameson
had
plunged
over
the
transvaal
border
with
about
600
armed
horsemen
at
his
back
to
go
to
the
relief
of
the
women
and
children
of
johannesburg
on
the
fourth
day
of
his
march
the
boers
had
defeated
him
in
battle
and
carried
him
and
his
men
to
pretoria
the
capital
as
prisoners
the
boer
government
had
turned
jameson
and
his
officers
over
to
the
british
government
for
trial
and
shipped
them
to
england
next
it
had
arrested
64
important
citizens
of
johannesburg
as
raid
conspirators
condemned
their
four
leaders
to
death
then
commuted
the
sentences
and
now
the
64
were
waiting
in
jail
for
further
results
before
midsummer
they
were
all
out
excepting
two
who
refused
to
sign
the
petitions
for
release
58
had
been
fined
$10
000
each
and
enlarged
and
the
four
leaders
had
gotten
off
with
fines
of
$125
000
each
with
permanent
exile
added
in
one
case
those
were
wonderfully
interesting
days
for
a
stranger
and
i
was
glad
to
be
in
the
thick
of
the
excitement
everybody
was
talking
and
i
expected
to
understand
the
whole
of
one
side
of
it
in
a
very
little
while
i
was
disappointed
there
were
singularities
perplexities
unaccountabilities
about
it
which
i
was
not
able
to
master
i
had
no
personal
access
to
boers
their
side
was
a
secret
to
me
aside
from
what
i
was
able
to
gather
of
it
from
published
statements
my
sympathies
were
soon
with
the
reformers
in
the
pretoria
jail
with
their
friends
and
with
their
cause
by
diligent
inquiry
in
johannesburg
i
found
out
apparently
all
the
details
of
their
side
of
the
quarrel
except
one
what
they
expected
to
accomplish
by
an
armed
rising
nobody
seemed
to
know
the
reason
why
the
reformers
were
discontented
and
wanted
some
changes
made
seemed
quite
clear
in
johannesburg
it
was
claimed
that
the
uitlanders
strangers
foreigners
paid
thirteen
fifteenths
of
the
transvaal
taxes
yet
got
little
or
nothing
for
it
their
city
had
no
charter
it
had
no
municipal
government
it
could
levy
no
taxes
for
drainage
water
supply
paving
cleaning
sanitation
policing
there
was
a
police
force
but
it
was
composed
of
boers
it
was
furnished
by
the
state
government
and
the
city
had
no
control
over
it
mining
was
very
costly
the
government
enormously
increased
the
cost
by
putting
burdensome
taxes
upon
the
mines
the
output
the
machinery
the
buildings
by
burdensome
imposts
upon
incoming
materials
by
burdensome
railway
freight
charges
hardest
of
all
to
bear
the
government
reserved
to
itself
a
monopoly
in
that
essential
thing
dynamite
and
burdened
it
with
an
extravagant
price
the
detested
hollander
from
over
the
water
held
all
the
public
offices
the
government
was
rank
with
corruption
the
uitlander
had
no
vote
and
must
live
in
the
state
ten
or
twelve
years
before
he
could
get
one
he
was
not
represented
in
the
raad
legislature
that
oppressed
him
and
fleeced
him
religion
was
not
free
there
were
no
schools
where
the
teaching
was
in
english
yet
the
great
majority
of
the
white
population
of
the
state
knew
no
tongue
but
that
the
state
would
not
pass
a
liquor
law
but
allowed
a
great
trade
in
cheap
vile
brandy
among
the
blacks
with
the
result
that
25
per
cent
of
the
50
000
blacks
employed
in
the
mines
were
usually
drunk
and
incapable
of
working
there
it
was
plain
enough
that
the
reasons
for
wanting
some
changes
made
were
abundant
and
reasonable
if
this
statement
of
the
existing
grievances
was
correct
what
the
uitlanders
wanted
was
reform
under
the
existing
republic
what
they
proposed
to
do
was
to
secure
these
reforms
by
prayer
petition
and
persuasion
they
did
petition
also
they
issued
a
manifesto
whose
very
first
note
is
a
bugle
blast
of
loyalty
we
want
the
establishment
of
this
republic
as
a
true
republic
could
anything
be
clearer
than
the
uitlander's
statement
of
the
grievances
and
oppressions
under
which
they
were
suffering
could
anything
be
more
legal
and
citizen
like
and
law
respecting
than
their
attitude
as
expressed
by
their
manifesto
no
those
things
were
perfectly
clear
perfectly
comprehensible
but
at
this
point
the
puzzles
and
riddles
and
confusions
begin
to
flock
in
you
have
arrived
at
a
place
which
you
cannot
quite
understand
for
you
find
that
as
a
preparation
for
this
loyal
lawful
and
in
every
way
unexceptionable
attempt
to
persuade
the
government
to
right
their
grievances
the
uitlanders
had
smuggled
a
maxim
gun
or
two
and
1
500
muskets
into
the
town
concealed
in
oil
tanks
and
coal
cars
and
had
begun
to
form
and
drill
military
companies
composed
of
clerks
merchants
and
citizens
generally
what
was
their
idea
did
they
suppose
that
the
boers
would
attack
them
for
petitioning
for
redress
that
could
not
be
did
they
suppose
that
the
boers
would
attack
them
even
for
issuing
a
manifesto
demanding
relief
under
the
existing
government
yes
they
apparently
believed
so
because
the
air
was
full
of
talk
of
forcing
the
government
to
grant
redress
if
it
were
not
granted
peacefully
the
reformers
were
men
of
high
intelligence
if
they
were
in
earnest
they
were
taking
extraordinary
risks
they
had
enormously
valuable
properties
to
defend
their
town
was
full
of
women
and
children
their
mines
and
compounds
were
packed
with
thousands
upon
thousands
of
sturdy
blacks
if
the
boers
attacked
the
mines
would
close
the
blacks
would
swarm
out
and
get
drunk
riot
and
conflagration
and
the
boers
together
might
lose
the
reformers
more
in
a
day
in
money
blood
and
suffering
than
the
desired
political
relief
could
compensate
in
ten
years
if
they
won
the
fight
and
secured
the
reforms
it
is
may
1897
now
a
year
has
gone
by
and
the
confusions
of
that
day
have
been
to
a
considerable
degree
cleared
away
mr
cecil
rhodes
dr
jameson
and
others
responsible
for
the
raid
have
testified
before
the
parliamentary
committee
of
inquiry
in
london
and
so
have
mr
lionel
phillips
and
other
johannesburg
reformers
monthly
nurses
of
the
revolution
which
was
born
dead
these
testimonies
have
thrown

to
this
light

it
is

together
and
pouring

into
my

i
have
got
at
the
truth
of
that
puzzling
south
african
situation
which
is
this
1
the
capitalists
and
other
chief
men
of
johannesburg
were
fretting
under
various
political
and
financial
burdens
imposed
by
the
state
the
south
african
republic
sometimes
called
the
transvaal
and
desired
to
procure
by
peaceful
means
a
modification
of

thought
he
saw
an

to

use
of
the
uitlander
discontent
above
mentioned
make
the
johannesburg
cat
help
pull
out
one
of
his
consolidation
chestnuts
for
him
with
this
view
he
set
himself
the
task
of
warming
the
lawful
and
legitimate
petitions
and
supplications
of
the
uitlanders
into
seditious
talk
and
their
frettings
into
threatenings
the
final
outcome
to
be
revolt
and
armed
rebellion
if
he
could
bring
about
a
bloody
collision
between
those
people
and
the
boer
government
great
britain
would
have
to
interfere
her
interference
would
be
resisted
by
the
boers
she
would
chastise
them
and
add
the
transvaal
to
her
south
african
possessions
it
was
not
a
foolish
idea
but
a
rational
and
practical
one
after
a
couple
of
years
of
judicious
plotting
mr
rhodes
had
his
reward
the
revolutionary
kettle
was
briskly
boiling
in
johannesburg
and
the
uitlander
leaders
were
backing
their
appeals
to
the
government
now
hardened
into
demands
by
threats
of
force
and
bloodshed
by
the
middle
of
december
1895
the
explosion
seemed
imminent
mr
rhodes
was
diligently
helping
from
his
distant
post
in
cape
town
he
was
helping
to
procure
arms
for
johannesburg
he
was
also
arranging
to
have
jameson
break
over
the
border
and
come
to
johannesburg
with
600
mounted
men
at
his
back
jameson
as
per
instructions
from
rhodes
perhaps
wanted
a
letter
from
the
reformers
requesting
him
to
come
to
their
aid
it
was
a
good
idea
it
would
throw
a
considerable
share
of
the
responsibility
of
his
invasion
upon
the
reformers
he
got
the
letter
that
famous
one
urging
him
to
fly
to
the
rescue
of
the
women
and
children
he
got
it
two
months
before
he
flew
the
reformers
seem
to
have
thought
it
over
and
concluded
that
they
had
not
done
wisely
for
the
next
day
after
giving
jameson
the
implicating
document
they
wanted
to
withdraw
it
and
leave
the
women
and
children
in
danger
but
they
were
told
that
it
was
too
late
the
original
had
gone
to
mr
rhodes
at
the
cape
jameson
had
kept
a
copy
though
from
that
time
until
the
29th
of
december
a
good
deal
of
the
reformers'
time
was
taken
up
with
energetic
efforts
to
keep
jameson
from
coming
to
their
assistance
jameson's
invasion
had
been
set
for
the
26th
the
reformers
were
not
ready
the
town
was
not
united
some
wanted
a
fight
some
wanted
peace
some
wanted
a
new
government
some
wanted
the
existing
one
reformed
apparently
very
few
wanted
the
revolution
to
take
place
in
the
interest
and
under
the
ultimate
shelter
of
the
imperial
flag
british
yet
a
report
began
to
spread
that
mr
rhodes's
embarrassing
assistance
had
for
its
end
this
latter
object
jameson
was
away
up
on
the
frontier
tugging
at
his
leash
fretting
to
burst
over
the
border
by
hard
work
the
reformers
got
his
starting
date
postponed
a
little
and
wanted
to
get
it
postponed
eleven
days
apparently
rhodes's
agents
were
seconding
their
efforts
in
fact
wearing
out
the
telegraph
wires
trying
to
hold
him
back
rhodes
was
himself
the
only
man
who
could
have
effectively
postponed
jameson
but
that
would
have
been
a
disadvantage
to
his
scheme
indeed
it
could
spoil
his
whole
two
years'
work
jameson
endured
postponement
three
days
then
resolved
to
wait
no
longer
without
any
orders
excepting
mr
rhodes's
significant
silence
he
cut
the
telegraph
wires
on
the
29th
and
made
his
plunge
that
night
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
the
women
and
children
by
urgent
request
of
a
letter
now
nine
days
old
as
per
date
a
couple
of
months
old
in
fact
he
read
the
letter
to
his
men
and
it
affected
them
it
did
not
affect
all
of
them
alike
some
saw
in
it
a
piece
of
piracy
of
doubtful
wisdom
and
were
sorry
to
find
that
they
had
been
assembled
to
violate
friendly
territory
instead
of
to
raid
native
kraals
as
they
had
supposed
jameson
would
have
to
ride
150
miles
he
knew
that
there
were
suspicions
abroad
in
the
transvaal
concerning
him
but
he
expected
to
get
through
to
johannesburg
before
they
should
become
general
and
obstructive
but
a
telegraph
wire
had
been
overlooked
and
not
cut
it
spread
the
news
of
his
invasion
far
and
wide
and
a
few
hours
after
his
start
the
boer
farmers
were
riding
hard
from
every
direction
to
intercept
him
as
soon
as
it
was
known
in
johannesburg
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
rescue
the
women
and
children
the
grateful
people
put
the
women
and
children
in
a
train
and
rushed
them
for
australia
in
fact
the
approach
of
johannesburg's
saviour
created
panic
and
consternation
there
and
a
multitude
of
males
of
peaceable
disposition
swept
to
the
trains
like
a
sand
storm
the
early
ones
fared
best
they
secured
seats
by
sitting
in
them
eight
hours
before
the
first
train
was
timed
to
leave
mr
rhodes
lost
no
time
he
cabled
the
renowned
johannesburg
letter
of
invitation
to
the
london
press
the
gray
headedest
piece
of
ancient
history
that
ever
went
over
a
cable
the
new
poet
laureate
lost
no
time
he
came
out
with
a
rousing
poem
lauding
jameson's
prompt
and
splendid
heroism
in
flying
to
the
rescue
of
the
women
and
children
for
the
poet
could
not
know
that
he
did
not
fly
until
two
months
after
the
invitation
he
was
deceived
by
the
false
date
of
the
letter
which
was
december
20th
jameson
was
intercepted
by
the
boers
on
new
year's
day
and
on
the
next
day
he
surrendered
he
had
carried
his
copy
of
the
letter
along
and
if
his
instructions
required
him
in
case
of
emergency
to
see
that
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
boers
he
loyally
carried
them
out
mrs
hammond
gives
him
a
sharp
rap
for
his
supposed
carelessness
and
emphasizes
her
feeling
about
it
with
burning
italics
it
was
picked
up
on
the
battle
field
in
a
leathern
pouch
supposed
to
be
dr
jameson's
saddle
bag
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
discreet
and
honorable
didn't
he
eat
it!
she
requires
too
much
he
was
not
in
the
service
of
the
reformers
excepting
ostensibly
he
was
in
the
service
of
mr
rhodes
it
was
the
only
plain
english
document
undarkened
by
ciphers
and
mysteries
and
responsibly
signed
and
authenticated
which
squarely
implicated
the
reformers
in
the
raid
and
it
was
not
to
mr
rhodes's
interest
that
it
should
be
eaten
besides
that
letter
was
not
the
original
it
was
only
a
copy
mr
rhodes
had
the
original
and
didn't
eat
it
he
cabled
it
to
the
london
press
it
had
already
been
read
in
england
and
america
and
all
over
europe
before
jameson
dropped
it
on
the
battlefield
if
the
subordinate's
knuckles
deserved
a
rap
the
principal's
deserved
as
many
as
a
couple
of
them
that
letter
is
a
juicily
dramatic
incident
and
is
entitled
to
all
its
celebrity
because
of
the
odd
and
variegated
effects
which
it
produced
all
within
the
space
of
a
single
week
it
had
made
jameson
an
illustrious
hero
in
england
a
pirate
in
pretoria
and
an
ass
without
discretion
or
honor
in
johannesburg
also
it
had
produced
a
poet
laureatic
explosion
of
colored
fireworks
which
filled
the
world's
sky
with
giddy
splendors
and
the
knowledge
that
jameson
was
coming
with
it
to
rescue
the
women
and
children
emptied
johannesburg
of
that
detail
of
the
population
for
an
old
letter
this
was
much
for
a
letter
two
months
old
it
did
marvels
if
it
had
been
a
year
old
it
would
have
done
miracles

those
latter
days
were
days
of
bitter
worry
and
trouble
for
the
harassed
reformers
from
mrs
hammond
we
learn
that
on
the
31st
the
day
after
johannesburg
heard
of
the
invasion
the
reform
committee
repudiates
dr
jameson's
inroad
it
also
publishes
its
intention
to
adhere
to
the
manifesto
it
also
earnestly
desires
that
the
inhabitants
shall
refrain
from
overt
acts
against
the
boer
government
it
also
distributes
arms
at
the
court
house
and
furnishes
horses
to
the
newly
enrolled
volunteers
it
also
brings
a
transvaal
flag
into

room
and
the
entire
body
swear
allegiance
to
it
with
uncovered
heads
and
upraised

also

have

in

reformer
lionel

informs
the
public
that
the
reform
committee
delegation
has
been
received
with
courtesy
by
the
government
commission
and
been
assured
that
their
proposals
shall
be
earnestly
considered
that
while
the
reform
committee
regretted
jameson's
precipitate
action
they
would
stand
by
him
also
the
populace
are
in
a
state
of
wild
enthusiasm
and
46
can
scarcely
be
restrained
they
want
to
go
out
to
meet
jameson
and
bring
him
in
with
triumphal
outcry
also
the
british
high
commissioner
has
issued
a
damnifying
proclamation
against
jameson
and
all
british
abettors
of
his
game
it
arrives
january
1st
it
is
a
difficult
position
for
the
reformers
and
full
of
hindrances
and
perplexities
their
duty
is
hard
but
plain
1
they
have
to
repudiate
the
inroad
and
stand
by
the
inroader
2
they
have
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
boer
government
and
distribute
cavalry
horses
to
the
rebels
3
they
have
to
forbid
overt
acts
against
the
boer
government
and
distribute
arms
to
its
enemies
4
they
have
to
avoid
collision
with
the
british
government
but
still
stand
by
jameson
and
their
new
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
boer
government
taken
uncovered
in
presence
of
its
flag
they
did
such
of
these
things
as
they
could
they
tried
to
do
them
all
in
fact
did
do
them
all
but
only
in
turn
not
simultaneously
in
the
nature
of
things
they
could
not
be
made
to
simultane
in
preparing
for
armed
revolution
and
in
talking
revolution
were
the
reformers
bluffing
or
were
they
in
earnest
if
they
were
in
earnest
they
were
taking
great
risks
as
has
been
already
pointed
out
a
gentleman
of
high
position
told
me
in
johannesburg
that
he
had
in
his
possession
a
printed
document
proclaiming
a
new
government
and
naming
its
president
one
of
the
reform
leaders
he
said
that
this
proclamation
had
been
ready
for
issue
but
was
suppressed
when
the
raid
collapsed
perhaps
i
misunderstood
him
indeed
i
must
have
misunderstood
him
for
i
have
not
seen
mention
of
this
large
incident
in
print
anywhere
besides
i
hope
i
am
mistaken
for
if
i
am
then
there
is
argument
that
the
reformers
were
privately
not
serious
but
were
only
trying
to
scare
the
boer
government
into
granting
the
desired
reforms
the
boer
government
was
scared
and
it
had
a
right
to
be
for
if
mr
rhodes's
plan
was
to
provoke
a
collision
that
would
compel
the
interference
of
england
that
was
a
serious
matter
if
it
could
be
shown
that
that
was
also
the
reformers'
plan
and
purpose
it
would
prove
that
they
had
marked
out
a
feasible
project
at
any
rate
although
it
was
one
which
could
hardly
fail
to
cost
them
ruinously
before
england
should
arrive
but
it
seems
clear
that
they
had
no
such
plan
nor
desire
if
when
the
worst
should
come
to
the
worst
they
meant
to
overthrow
the
government
they
also
meant
to
inherit
the
assets
themselves
no
doubt
this
scheme
could
hardly
have
succeeded
with
an
army
of
boers
at
their
gates
and
50
000
riotous
blacks
in
their
midst
the
odds
against
success
would
have
been
too
heavy
even
if
the
whole
town
had
been
armed
with
only
2
500
rifles
in
the
place
they
stood
really
no
chance
to
me
the
military
problems
of
the
situation
are
of
more
interest
than
the
political
ones
because
by
disposition
i
have
always
been
especially
fond
of
war
no
i
mean
fond
of
discussing
war
and
fond
of
giving
military
advice
if
i
had
been
with
jameson
the
morning
after
he
started
i
should
have
advised
him
to
turn
back
that
was
monday
it
was
then
that
he
received
his
first
warning
from
a
boer
source
not
to
violate
the
friendly
soil
of
the
transvaal
it
showed
that
his
invasion
was
known
if
i
had
been
with
him
on
tuesday
morning
and
afternoon
when
he
received
further
warnings
i
should
have
repeated
my
advice
if
i
had
been
with
him
the
next
morning
new
year's
when
he
received
notice
that
a
few
hundred
boers
were
waiting
for
him
a
few
miles
ahead
i
should
not
have
advised
but
commanded
him
to
go
back
and
if
i
had
been
with
him
two
or
three
hours
later
a
thing
not
conceivable
to
me
i
should
have
retired
him
by
force
for
at
that
time
he
learned
that
the
few
hundred
had
now
grown
to
800
and
that
meant
that
the
growing
would
go
on
growing
for
by
authority
of
mr
garrett
one
knows
that
jameson's
600
were
only
530
at
most
when
you
count
out
his
native
drivers
etc
and
that
the
530
consisted
largely
of
green
youths
raw
young
fellows
not
trained
and

worn

soldiers
and
i
would
have
told
jameson
that
those
lads
would
not
be
able
to
shoot
effectively
from
horseback
in
the
scamper
and
racket
of
battle
and
that
there
would
not
be
anything
for
them
to
shoot
at
anyway
but
rocks
for
the
boers
would
be
behind
the
rocks
not
out
in
the
open
i
would
have
told
him
that
300
boer
sharpshooters
behind
rocks
would
be
an
overmatch
for
his
500
raw
young
fellows
on
horseback
if
pluck
were
the
only
thing
essential
to
battle
winning
the
english
would
lose
no
battles
but
discretion
as
well
as
pluck
is
required
when
one
fights
boers
and
red
indians
in
south
africa
the
briton
has
always
insisted
upon
standing
bravely
up
unsheltered
before
the
hidden
boer
and
taking
the
results
jameson's
men
would
follow
the
custom
jameson
would
not
have
listened
to
me
he
would
have
been
intent
upon
repeating
history
according
to
precedent
americans
are
not
acquainted
with
the
british
boer
war
of
1881
but
its
history
is
interesting
and
could
have
been
instructive
to
jameson
if
he
had
been
receptive
i
will
cull
some
details
of
it
from
trustworthy
sources
mainly
from
russell's
natal
mr
russell
is
not
a
boer
but
a
briton
he
is
inspector
of
schools
and
his
history
is
a
text
book
whose
purpose
is
the
instruction
of
the
natal
english
youth
after
the
seizure
of
the
transvaal
and
the
suppression
of
the
boer
government
by
england
in
1877
the
boers
fretted
for
three
years
and
made
several
appeals
to
england
for
a
restoration
of
their
liberties
but
without
result
then
they
gathered
themselves
together
in
a
great
mass
meeting
at
krugersdorp
talked
their
troubles
over
and
resolved
to
fight
for
their
deliverance
from
the
british
yoke
krugersdorp
the
place
where
the
boers
interrupted
the
jameson
raid
the
little
handful
of
farmers
rose
against
the
strongest
empire
in
the
world
they
proclaimed
martial
law
and
the
re
establishment
of
their
republic
they
organized
their
forces
and
sent
them
forward
to
intercept
the
british
battalions
this
although
sir
garnet
wolseley
had
but
lately
made
proclamation
that
so
long
as
the
sun
shone
in
the
heavens
the
transvaal
would
be
and
remain
english
territory
and
also
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
commander
of
the
94th
regiment
already
on
the
march
to
suppress
this
rebellion
had
been
heard
to
say
that
the
boers
would
turn

there
was
a
season
of
quiet
now
but
at
the
end
of
about
three
weeks
sir
george
colley
conceived
the
idea
of
climbing
with
an
infantry
and
artillery
force
the
steep
and
rugged
mountain
of
amajuba
in
the
night
a
bitter
hard
task
but
he
accomplished
it
on
the
way
he
left
about
200
men
to
guard
a
strategic
point
and
took
about
400
up
the
mountain
with
him
when
the
sun
rose
in
the
morning
there
was
an
unpleasant
surprise
for
the
boers
yonder
were
the
english
troops
visible
on
top
of
the
mountain
two
or
three
miles
away
and
now
their
own
position
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
english
artillery
the
boer
chief
resolved
to
retreat
up
that
mountain
he
asked
for
volunteers
and
got
them
the
storming
party
crossed
the
swale
and
began
to
creep
up
the
steeps
and
from
behind
rocks
and
bushes
they
shot
at
the
soldiers
on
the
skyline
as
if
they
were
stalking
deer
says
mr
russell
there
was
continuous
musketry
fire
steady
and
fatal
on
the
one
side
wild
and
ineffectual
on
the
other
the
boers
reached
the
top
and
began
to
put
in
their
ruinous
work
presently
the
british
broke
and
fled
for
their
lives
down
the
rugged
steep
the
boers
had
won
the
battle
result
in
killed
and
wounded
including
among
the
killed
the
british
general
british
loss
226
out
of

boer

1
killed
5
wounded
that
ended
the
war
england
listened
to
reason
and
recognized
the
boer
republic
a
government
which
has
never
been
in
any
really
awful
danger
since
until
jameson
started
after
it
with
his
500
raw
young
fellows
to
recapitulate
the
boer
farmers
and
british
soldiers
fought
4
battles
and
the
boers
won
them
all
result
of
the
4
in
killed
and
wounded
british
loss
700
men
boer
loss
so
far
as
known
23
men
it
is
interesting
now
to
note
how
loyally
jameson
and
his
several
trained
british
military
officers
tried
to
make
their
battles
conform
to
precedent
mr
garrett's
account
of
the
raid
is
much
the
best
one
i
have
met
with
and
my
impressions
of
the
raid
are
drawn
from
that
when
jameson
learned
that
near
krugersdorp
he
would
find
800
boers
waiting
to
dispute
his
passage
he
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
he
was
feeling
as
he
had
felt
two
or
three
days
before
when
he
had
opened
his
campaign
with
a
historic
remark
to
the
same
purport
as
the
one
with
which
the
commander
of
the
94th
had
opened
the
boer
british
war
of
fourteen
years
before
that
commander's
remark
was
that
the
boers
would
turn
tail
at
the
first
beat
of
the
big
drum
jameson's
was
that
with
his
raw
young
fellows
he
could
kick
the
persons
of
the
boers
all
round
the
transvaal
he
was
keeping
close
to
historic
precedent
jameson
arrived
in
the
presence
of
the
boers
they
according
to
precedent
were
not
visible
it
was
a
country
of
ridges
depressions
rocks
ditches
moraines
of
mining
tailings
not
even
as
favorable
for
cavalry
work
as
laing's
nek
had
been
in
the
former
disastrous
days
jameson
shot
at
the
ridges
and
rocks
with
his
artillery
just
as
general
colley
had
done
at
the
nek
and
did
them
no
damage
and
persuaded
no
boer
to
show
himself
then
about
a
hundred
of
his
men
formed
up
to
charge
the
ridge
according
to
the
58th's
precedent
at
the
nek
but
as
they
dashed
forward
they
opened
out
in
a
long
line
which
was
a
considerable
improvement
on
the
58th's
tactics
when
they
had
gotten
to
within
200
yards
of
the
ridge
the
concealed
boers
opened
out
on
them
and
emptied
20
saddles
the
unwounded
dismounted
and
fired
at
the
rocks
over
the
backs
of
their
horses
but
the
return
fire
was
too
hot
and
they
mounted
again
and
galloped
back
or
crawled
away
into
a
clump
of
reeds
for
cover
where
they
were
shortly
afterward
taken
prisoners
as
they
lay
among
the
reeds
some
thirty
prisoners
were
so
taken
and
during
the
night
which
followed
the
boers
carried
away
another
thirty
killed
and
wounded
the
wounded
to
krugersdorp
hospital
sixty
per
cent
of
the
assaulted
force
disposed
of
according
to
mr
garrett's
estimate
it
was
according
to
amajuba
precedent
where
the
british
loss
was
226
out
of
about
400
engaged
also
in
jameson's
camp
that
night
there
lay
about
30
wounded
or
otherwise
disabled
men
also
during
the
night
some
30
or
40
young
fellows
got
separated
from
the
command
and
straggled
through
into
johannesburg
altogether
a
possible
150
men
gone
out
of
his
530
his
lads
had
fought
valorously
but
had
not
been
able
to
get
near
enough
to
a
boer
to
kick
him
around
the
transvaal
at
dawn
the
next
morning
the
column
of
something
short
of
400
whites
resumed
its
march
jameson's
grit
was
stubbornly
good
indeed
it
was
always
that
he
still
had
hopes
there
was
a
long
and
tedious
zigzagging
march
through
broken
ground
with
constant
harassment
from
the
boers
and
at
last
the
column
walked
into
a
sort
of
trap
and
the
boers
closed
in
upon
it
men
and
horses
dropped
on
all
sides
in
the
column
the
feeling
grew
that
unless
it
could
burst
through
the
boer
lines
at
this
point
it
was
done
for
the
maxims
were
fired
until
they
grew
too
hot
and
water
failing
for
the
cool
jacket
five
of
them
jammed
and
went
out
of
action
the
7
pounder
was
fired
until
only
half
an
hour's
ammunition
was
left
to
fire
with
one
last
rush
was
made
and
failed
and
then
the
staats
artillery
came
up
on
the
left
flank
and
the
game
was
up
jameson
hoisted
a
white
flag
and
surrendered
there
is
a
story
which
may
not
be
true
about
an
ignorant
boer
farmer
there
who
thought
that
this
white
flag
was
the
national
flag
of
england
he
had
been
at
bronkhorst
and
laing's
nek
and
ingogo
and
amajuba
and
supposed
that
the
english
did
not
run
up
their
flag
excepting
at
the
end
of
a
fight
the
following
is
as
i
understand
it
mr
garrett's
estimate
of
jameson's
total
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
for
the
two
days
when
they
gave
in
they
were
minus
some
20
per
cent
of
combatants
there
were
76
casualties
there
were
30
men
hurt
or
sick
in
the
wagons
there
were
27
killed
on
the
spot
or
mortally
wounded
total
133
out
of
the
original
530
it
is
just
25
per
cent
[however
i
judge
that
the
total
was
really
150
for
the
number
of
wounded
carried
to
krugersdorp
hospital
was
53
not
30
as
mr
garrett
reports
it
the
lady
whose
guest
i
was
in
krugerdorp
gave
me
the
figures
she
was
head
nurse
from
the
beginning
of
hostilities
jan
1
until
the
professional
nurses
arrived
jan
8th
of
the
53
three
or
four
were
boers
i
quote
her
words
]
this
is
a
large
improvement
upon
the
precedents
established
at
bronkhorst
laing's
nek
ingogo
and
amajuba
and
seems
to
indicate
that
boer
marksmanship
is
not
so
good
now
as
it
was
in
those
days
but
there
is
one
detail
in
which
the
raid
episode
exactly
repeats
history
by
surrender
at
bronkhorst
the
whole
british
force
disappeared
from
the
theater
of
war
this
was
the
case
with
jameson's
force
in
the
boer
loss
also
historical
precedent
is
followed
with
sufficient
fidelity
in
the
4
battles
named
above
the
boer
loss
so
far
as
known
was
an
average
of
6
men
per
battle
to
the
british
average
loss
of
175
in
jameson's
battles
as
per
boer
official
report
the
boer
loss
in
killed
was
4
two
of
these
were
killed
by
the
boers
themselves
by
accident
the
other
by
jameson's
army
one
of
them
intentionally
the
other
by
a
pathetic
mischance
a
young
boer
named
jacobz
was
moving
forward
to
give
a
drink
to
one
of
the
wounded
troopers
jameson's
after
the
first
charge
when
another
wounded
man
mistaking
his
intention
shot
him
there
were
three
or
four
wounded
boers
in
the
krugersdorp
hospital
and
apparently
no
others
have
been
reported
mr
garrett
on
a
balance
of
probabilities
fully
accepts
the
official
version
and
thanks
heaven
the
killed
was
not
larger
as
a
military
man
i
wish
to
point
out
what
seems
to
me
to
be
military
errors
in
the
conduct
of
the
campaign
which
we
have
just
been
considering
i
have
seen
active
service
in
the
field
and
it
was
in
the
actualities
of
war
that
i
acquired
my
training
and
my
right
to
speak
i
served
two
weeks
in
the
beginning
of
our
civil
war
and
during
all
that
tune
commanded
a
battery
of
infantry
composed
of
twelve
men
general
grant
knew
the
history
of
my
campaign
for
i
told
it
him
i
also
told
him
the
principle
upon
which
i
had
conducted
it
which
was
to
tire
the
enemy
i
tired
out
and
disqualified
many
battalions
yet
never
had
a
casualty
myself
nor
lost
a
man
general
grant
was
not
given
to
paying
compliments
yet
he
said
frankly
that
if
i
had
conducted
the
whole
war
much
bloodshed
would
have
been
spared
and
that
what
the
army
might
have
lost
through
the
inspiriting
results
of
collision
in
the
field
would
have
been
amply
made
up
by
the
liberalizing
influences
of
travel
further
endorsement
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
necessary
let
us
now
examine
history
and
see
what
it
teaches
in
the
4
battles
fought
in
1881
and
the
two
fought
by
jameson
the
british
loss
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
was
substantially
1
300
men
the
boer
loss
as
far
as
is
ascertainable
eras
about
30
men
these
figures
show
that
there
was
a
defect
somewhere
it
was
not
in
the
absence
of
courage
i
think
it
lay
in
the
absence
of
discretion
the
briton
should
have
done
one
thing
or
the
other
discarded
british
methods
and
fought
the
boer
with
boer
methods
or
augmented
his
own
force
until
using
british
methods
it
should
be
large
enough
to
equalize
results
with
the
boer
to
retain
the
british
method
requires
certain
things
determinable
by
arithmetic
if
for
argument's
sake
we
allow
that
the
aggregate
of
1
716
british
soldiers
engaged
in
the
4
early
battles
was
opposed
by
the
same
aggregate
of
boers
we
have
this
result
the
british
loss
of
700
and
the
boer
loss

argues
that
in
order
to
equalize
results
in
future
battles
you
must
make
the
british
force
thirty
times
as
strong
as
the
boer
force
mr
garrett
shows
that
the
boer
force
immediately
opposed
to
jameson
was
2
000
and
that
there
were
6
000
more
on
hand
by
the
evening
of
the
second
day
arithmetic
shows
that
in
order
to
make
himself
the
equal
of
the
8
000
boers
jameson
should
have
had
240
000
men
whereas
he
merely
had
530
boys
from
a
military
point
of
view
backed
by
the
facts
of
history
i
conceive
that
jameson's
military
judgment
was
at
fault
another
thing
jameson
was
encumbered
by
artillery
ammunition
and
rifles
the
facts
of
the
battle
show
that
he
should
have
had
none
of
those
things
along
they
were
heavy
they
were
in
his
way
they
impeded
his
march
there
was
nothing
to
shoot
at
but
rocks
he
knew
quite
well
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
shoot
at
but
rocks
and
he
knew
that
artillery
and
rifles
have
no
effect
upon
rocks
he
was
badly
overloaded
with
unessentials
he
had
8
maxims
a
maxim
is
a
kind
of
gatling
i
believe
and
shoots
about
500
bullets
per
minute
he
had
one
12
1/2
pounder
cannon
and
two
7
pounders
also
145
000
rounds
of
ammunition
he
worked
the
maxims
so
hard
upon
the
rocks
that
five
of
them
became
disabled
five
of
the
maxims
not
the
rocks
it
is
believed
that
upwards
of
100
000
rounds
of
ammunition
of
the
various
kinds
were
fired
during
the
21
hours
that
the
battles
lasted
one
man
killed
he
must
have
been
much
mutilated
it
was
a
pity
to
bring
those
futile
maxims
along
jameson
should
have
furnished
himself
with
a
battery
of
pudd'nhead
wilson
maxims
instead
they
are
much
more
deadly
than
those
others
and
they
are
easily
carried
because
they
have
no
weight
mr
garrett
not
very
carefully
concealing
a
smile
excuses
the
presence
of
the
maxims
by
saying
that
they
were
of
very
substantial
use
because
their
sputtering
disordered
the
aim
of
the
boers
and
in
that
way
saved
lives
three
cannon
eight
maxims
and
five
hundred
rifles
yielded
a
result
which
emphasized
a
fact
which
had
already
been
established
that
the
british
system
of
standing
out
in
the
open
to
fight
boers
who
are
behind
rocks
is
not
wise
not
excusable
and
ought
to
be
abandoned
for
something
more
efficacious
for
the
purpose
of
war
is
to
kill
not
merely
to
waste
ammunition
if
i
could
get
the
management
of
one
of
those
campaigns
i
would
know
what
to
do
for
i
have
studied
the
boer
he
values
the
bible
above
every
other
thing
the
most
delicious
edible
in
south
africa
is
biltong
you
will
have
seen
it
mentioned
in
olive
schreiner's
books
it
is
what
our
plainsmen
call
jerked
beef
it
is
the
boer's
main
standby
he
has
a
passion
for
it
and
he
is
right
if
i
had
the
command
of
the
campaign
i
would
go
with
rifles
only
no
cumbersome
maxims
and
cannon
to
spoil
good
rocks
with
i
would
move
surreptitiously
by
night
to
a
point
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
boer
camp
and
there
i
would
build
up
a
pyramid
of
biltong
and
bibles
fifty
feet
high
and
then
conceal
my
men
all
about
in
the
morning
the
boers
would
send
out
spies
and
then
the
rest
would
come
with
a
rush
i
would
surround
them
and
they
would
have
to
fight
my
men
on
equal
terms
in
the
open
there
wouldn't
be
any
amajuba
results
[just
as
i
am
finishing
this
book
an
unfortunate
dispute
has
sprung
up
between
dr
jameson
and
his
officers
on
the
one
hand
and
colonel
rhodes
on
the
other
concerning
the
wording
of
a
note
which
colonel
rhodes
sent
from
johannesburg
by
a
cyclist
to
jameson
just
before
hostilities
began
on
the
memorable
new
year's
day
some
of
the
fragments
of
this
note
were
found
on
the
battlefield
after
the
fight
and
these
have
been
pieced
together
the
dispute
is
as
to
what
words
the
lacking
fragments
contained
jameson
says
the
note
promised
him
a
reinforcement
of
300
men
from
johannesburg
colonel
rhodes
denies
this
and
says
he
merely
promised
to
send
out
some
men
to
meet
you
]
[it
seems
a
pity
that
these
friends
should
fall
out
over
so
little
a
thing
if
the
300
had
been
sent
what
good
would
it
have
done
in
21
hours
of
industrious
fighting
jameson's
530
men
with
8
maxims
3
cannon
and
145
000
rounds
of
ammunition
killed
an
aggregate
of
1
boer
these
statistics
show
that
a
reinforcement
of
300
johannesburgers
armed
merely
with
muskets
would
have
killed
at
the
outside
only
a
little
over
a
half
of
another
boer
this
would
not
have
saved
the
day
it
would
not
even
have
seriously
affected
the
general
result
the
figures
show
clearly
and
with
mathematical
violence
that
the
only
way
to
save
jameson
or
even
give
him
a
fair
and
equal
chance
with
the
enemy
was
for
johannesburg
to
send
him
240
maxims
90
cannon
600
carloads
of
ammunition
and
240
000
men
johannesburg
was
not
in
a
position
to
do
this
johannesburg
has
been
called
very
hard
names
for
not
reinforcing
jameson
but
in
every
instance
this
has
been
done
by
two
classes
of
persons
people
who
do
not
read
history
and
people
like
jameson
who
do
not
understand
what
it
means
after
they
have
read
it

chapter
lxviii
none
of
us
can
have
as
many
virtues
as
the
fountain
pen
or
half
its
cussedness
but
we
can
try
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
the
duke
of
fife
has
borne
testimony
that
mr
rhodes
deceived
him
that
is
also
what
mr
rhodes
did
with
the
reformers
he
got
them
into
trouble
and
then
stayed
out
himself
a
judicious
man
he
has
always
been
that
as
to
this
there
was
a
moment
of
doubt
once
it
was
when
he
was
out
on
his
last
pirating
expedition
in
the
matabele
country
the
cable
shouted
out
that
he
had
gone
unarmed
to
visit
a
party
of
hostile
chiefs
it
was
true
too
and
this
dare
devil
thing
came
near
fetching
another
indiscretion
out
of
the
poet
laureate
it
would
have
been
too
bad
for
when
the
facts
were
all
in
it
turned
out
that
there
was
a
lady
along
too
and
she
also
was
unarmed
in
the
opinion
of
many
people
mr
rhodes
is
south
africa
others
think
he
is
only
a
large
part
of
it
these
latter
consider
that
south
africa
consists
of
table
mountain
the
diamond
mines
the
johannesburg
gold
fields
and
cecil
rhodes
the
gold
fields
are
wonderful
in
every
way
in
seven
or
eight
years
they
built
up
in
a
desert
a
city
of
a
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
counting
white
and
black
together
and
not
the
ordinary
mining
city
of
wooden
shanties
but
a
city
made
out
of
lasting
material
nowhere
in
the
world
is
there
such
a
concentration
of
rich
mines
as
at
johannesburg
mr
bonamici
my
manager
there
gave
me
a
small
gold
brick
with
some
statistics
engraved
upon
it
which
record
the
output
of
gold
from
the
early
days
to
july
1895
and
exhibit
the
strides
which
have
been
made
in
the
development
of
the
industry
in
1888
the
output
was
$4
162
440
the
output
of
the
next
five
and
a
half
years
was
total
$17
585
894
for
the
single
year
ending
with
june
1895
it
was
$45
553
700
the
capital
which
has
developed
the
mines
came
from
england
the
mining
engineers
from
america
this
is
the
case
with
the
diamond
mines
also
south
africa
seems
to
be
the
heaven
of
the
american
scientific
mining
engineer
he
gets
the
choicest
places
and
keeps
them
his
salary
is
not
based
upon
what
he
would
get
in
america
but
apparently
upon
what
a
whole
family
of
him
would
get
there
the
successful
mines
pay
great
dividends
yet
the
rock
is
not
rich
from
a
californian
point
of
view
rock
which
yields
ten
or
twelve
dollars
a
ton
is
considered
plenty
rich
enough
it
is
troubled
with
base
metals
to
such
a
degree
that
twenty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
only
about
half
as
valuable
as
it
is
now
for
at
that
time
there
was
no
paying
way
of
getting
anything
out
of
such
rock
but
the
coarser
grained
free
gold
but
the
new
cyanide
process
has
changed
all
that
and
the
gold
fields
of
the
world
now
deliver
up
fifty
million
dollars'
worth
of
gold
per
year
which
would
have
gone
into
the
tailing
pile
under
the
former
conditions
the
cyanide
process
was
new
to
me
and
full
of
interest
and
among
the
costly
and
elaborate
mining
machinery
there
were
fine
things
which
were
new
to
me
but
i
was
already
familiar
with
the
rest
of
the
details
of
the
gold
mining
industry
i
had
been
a
gold
miner
myself
in
my
day
and
knew
substantially
everything
that
those
people
knew
about
it
except
how
to
make
money
at
it
but
i
learned
a
good
deal
about
the
boers
there
and
that
was
a
fresh
subject
what
i
heard
there
was
afterwards
repeated
to
me
in
other
parts
of
south
africa
summed
up
according
to
the
information
thus
gained
this
is
the
boer
he
is
deeply
religious
profoundly
ignorant
dull
obstinate
bigoted
uncleanly
in
his
habits
hospitable
honest
in
his
dealings
with
the
whites
a
hard
master
to
his
black
servant
lazy
a
good
shot
good
horseman
addicted
to
the
chase
a
lover
of
political
independence
a
good
husband
and
father
not
fond
of
herding
together
in
towns
but
liking
the
seclusion
and
remoteness
and
solitude
and
empty
vastness
and
silence
of
the
veldt
a
man
of
a
mighty
appetite
and
not
delicate
about
what
he
appeases
it
with
well
satisfied
with
pork
and
indian
corn
and
biltong
requiring
only
that
the
quantity
shall
not
be
stinted
willing
to
ride
a
long
journey
to
take
a
hand
in
a
rude
all
night
dance
interspersed
with
vigorous
feeding
and
boisterous
jollity
but
ready
to
ride
twice
as
far
for
a
prayer
meeting
proud
of
his
dutch
and
huguenot
origin
and
its
religious
and
military
history
proud
of
his
race's
achievements
in
south
africa
its
bold
plunges
into
hostile
and
uncharted
deserts
in
search
of
free
solitudes
unvexed
by
the
pestering
and
detested
english
also
its
victories
over
the
natives
and
the
british
proudest
of
all
of
the
direct
and
effusive
personal
interest
which
the
deity
has
always
taken
in
its
affairs
he
cannot
read
he
cannot
write
he
has
one
or
two
newspapers
but
he
is
apparently
not
aware
of
it
until
latterly
he
had
no
schools
and
taught
his
children
nothing
news
is
a
term
which
has
no
meaning
to
him
and
the
thing
itself
he
cares
nothing
about
he
hates
to
be
taxed
and
resents
it
he
has
stood
stock
still
in
south
africa
for
two
centuries
and
a
half
and
would
like
to
stand
still
till
the
end
of
time
for
he
has
no
sympathy
with
uitlander
notions
of
progress
he
is
hungry
to
be
rich
for
he
is
human
but
his
preference
has
been
for
riches
in
cattle
not
in
fine
clothes
and
fine
houses
and
gold
and
diamonds
the
gold
and
the
diamonds
have
brought
the
godless
stranger
within
his
gates
also
contamination
and
broken
repose
and
he
wishes
that
they
had
never
been
discovered
i
think
that
the
bulk
of
those
details
can
be
found
in
olive
schreiner's
books
and
she
would
not
be
accused
of
sketching
the
boer's
portrait
with
an
unfair
hand
now
what
would
you
expect
from
that
unpromising
material
what
ought
you
to
expect
from
it
laws
inimical
to
religious
liberty
yes
laws
denying
representation
and
suffrage
to
the
intruder
yes
laws
unfriendly
to
educational
institutions
yes
laws
obstructive
of
gold
production
yes
discouragement
of
railway
expansion
yes
laws
heavily
taxing
the
intruder
and
overlooking
the
boer
yes
the
uitlander
seems
to
have
expected
something
very
different
from
all
that
i
do
not
know
why
nothing
different
from
it
was
rationally
to
be
expected
a
round
man
cannot
be
expected
to
fit
a
square
hole
right
away
he
must
have
time
to
modify
his
shape
the
modification
had
begun
in
a
detail
or
two
before
the
raid
and
was
making
some
progress
it
has
made
further
progress
since
there
are
wise
men
in
the
boer
government
and
that
accounts
for
the
modification
the
modification
of
the
boer
mass
has
probably
not
begun
yet
if
the
heads
of
the
boer
government
had
not
been
wise
men
they
would
have
hanged
jameson
and
thus
turned
a
very
commonplace
pirate
into
a
holy
martyr
but
even
their
wisdom
has
its
limits
and
they
will
hang
mr
rhodes
if
they
ever
catch
him
that
will
round
him
and
complete
him
and
make
him
a
saint
he
has
already
been
called
by
all
other
titles
that
symbolize
human
grandeur
and
he
ought
to
rise
to
this
one
the
grandest
of
all
it
will
be
a
dizzy
jump
from
where
he
is
now
but
that
is
nothing
it
will
land
him
in
good
company
and
be
a
pleasant
change
for
him
some
of
the
things
demanded
by
the
johannesburgers'
manifesto
have
been
conceded
since
the
days
of
the
raid
and
the
others
will
follow
in
time
no
doubt
it
was
most
fortunate
for
the
miners
of
johannesburg
that
the
taxes
which
distressed
them
so
much
were
levied
by
the
boer
government
instead
of
by
their
friend
rhodes
and
his
chartered
company
of
highwaymen
for
these
latter
take
half
of
whatever
their
mining
victims
find
they
do
not
stop
at
a
mere
percentage
if
the
johannesburg
miners
were
under
their
jurisdiction
they
would
be
in
the
poorhouse
in
twelve
months
i
have
been
under
the
impression
all
along
that
i
had
an
unpleasant
paragraph
about
the
boers
somewhere
in
my
notebook
and
also
a
pleasant
one
i
have
found
them
now
the
unpleasant
one
is
dated
at
an
interior
village
and
says
mr
z
called
he
is
an
english
afrikander
is
an
old
resident
and
has
a
boer
wife
he
speaks
the
language
and
his
professional
business
is
with
the
boers
exclusively
he
told
me
that
the
ancient
boer
families
in
the
great
region
of
which
this
village
is
the
commercial
center
are
falling
victims
to
their
inherited
indolence
and
dullness
in
the
materialistic
latter
day
race
and
struggle
and
are
dropping
one
by
one
into
the
grip
of
the
usurer
getting
hopelessly
in
debt
and
are
losing
their
high
place
and
retiring
to
second
and
lower
the
boer's
farm
does
not
go
to
another
boer
when
he
loses
it
but
to
a
foreigner
some
have
fallen
so
low
that
they
sell
their
daughters
to
the
blacks
under
date
of
another
south
african
town
i
find
the
note
which
is
creditable
to
the
boers
dr
x
told
me
that
in
the
kafir
war
1
500
kafirs
took
refuge
in
a
great
cave
in
the
mountains
about
90
miles
north
of
johannesburg
and
the
boers
blocked
up
the
entrance
and
smoked
them
to
death
dr
x
has
been
in
there
and
seen
the
great
array
of
bleached
skeletons
one
a
woman
with
the
skeleton
of
a
child
hugged
to
her
breast
the
great
bulk
of
the
savages
must
go
the
white
man
wants
their
lands
and
all
must
go
excepting
such
percentage
of
them
as
he
will
need
to
do
his
work
for
him
upon
terms
to
be
determined
by
himself
since
history
has
removed
the
element
of
guesswork
from
this
matter
and
made
it
certainty
the
humanest
way
of
diminishing
the
black
population
should
be
adopted
not
the
old
cruel
ways
of
the
past
mr
rhodes
and
his
gang
have
been
following
the
old
ways
they
are
chartered
to
rob
and
slay
and
they
lawfully
do
it
but
not
in
a
compassionate
and
christian
spirit
they
rob
the
mashonas
and
the
matabeles
of
a
portion
of
their
territories
in
the
hallowed
old
style
of
purchase!
for
a
song
and
then
they
force
a
quarrel
and
take
the
rest
by
the
strong
hand
they
rob
the
natives
of
their
cattle
under
the
pretext
that
all
the
cattle
in
the
country
belonged
to
the
king
whom
they
have
tricked
and
assassinated
they
issue
regulations
requiring
the
incensed
and
harassed
natives
to
work
for
the
white
settlers
and
neglect
their
own
affairs
to
do
it
this
is
slavery
and
is
several
times
worse
than
was
the
american
slavery
which
used
to
pain
england
so
much
for
when
this
rhodesian
slave
is
sick
super
annuated
or
otherwise
disabled
he
must
support
himself
or
starve
his
master
is
under
no
obligation
to
support
him
the
reduction
of
the
population
by
rhodesian
methods
to
the
desired
limit
is
a
return
to
the
old
time
slow
misery
and
lingering
death
system
of
a
discredited
time
and
a
crude
civilization
we
humanely
reduce
an
overplus
of
dogs
by
swift
chloroform
the
boer
humanely
reduced
an
overplus
of
blacks
by
swift
suffocation
the
nameless
but
right
hearted
australian
pioneer
humanely
reduced
his
overplus
of
aboriginal
neighbors
by
a
sweetened
swift
death
concealed
in
a
poisoned
pudding
all
these
are
admirable
and
worthy
of
praise
you
and
i
would
rather
suffer
either
of
these
deaths
thirty
times
over
in
thirty
successive
days
than
linger
out
one
of
the
rhodesian
twenty
year
deaths
with
its
daily
burden
of
insult
humiliation
and
forced
labor
for
a
man
whose
entire
race
the
victim
hates
rhodesia
is
a
happy
name
for
that
land
of
piracy
and
pillage
and
puts
the
right
stain
upon
it
several
long
journeys
gave
us
experience
of
the
cape
colony
railways
easy
riding
fine
cars
all
the
conveniences
thorough
cleanliness
comfortable
beds
furnished
for
the
night
trains
it
was
in
the
first
days
of
june
and
winter
the
daytime
was
pleasant
the
nighttime
nice
and
cold
spinning
along
all
day
in
the
cars
it
was
ecstasy
to
breathe
the
bracing
air
and
gaze
out
over
the
vast
brown
solitudes
of
the
velvet
plains
soft
and
lovely
near
by
still
softer
and
lovelier
further
away
softest
and
loveliest
of
all
in
the
remote
distances
where
dim
island
hills
seemed
afloat
as
in
a
sea
a
sea
made
of
dream
stuff
and
flushed
with
colors
faint
and
rich
and
dear
me
the
depth
of
the
sky
and
the
beauty
of
the
strange
new
cloud
forms
and
the
glory
of
the
sunshine
the
lavishness
the
wastefulness
of
it!
the
vigor
and
freshness
and
inspiration
of
the
air
and
the
sunwell
it
was
all
just
as
olive
schreiner
had
made
it
in
her
books
to
me
the
veldt
in
its
sober
winter
garb
was
surpassingly
beautiful
there
were
unlevel
stretches
where
it
was
rolling
and
swelling
and
rising
and
subsiding
and
sweeping
superbly
on
and
on
and
still
on
and
on
like
an
ocean
toward
the
faraway
horizon
its
pale
brown
deepening
by
delicately
graduated
shades
to
rich
orange
and
finally
to
purple
and
crimson
where
it
washed
against
the
wooded
hills
and
naked
red
crags
at
the
base
of
the
sky
everywhere
from
cape
town
to
kimberley
and
from
kimberley
to
port
elizabeth
and
east
london
the
towns
were
well
populated
with
tamed
blacks
tamed
and
christianized
too
i
suppose
for
they
wore
the
dowdy
clothes
of
our
christian
civilization
but
for
that
many
of
them
would
have
been
remarkably
handsome
these
fiendish
clothes
together
with
the
proper
lounging
gait
good
natured
face
happy
air
and
easy
laugh
made
them
precise
counterparts
of
our
american
blacks
often
where
all
the
other
aspects
were
strikingly
and
harmoniously
and
thrillingly
african
a
flock
of
these
natives
would
intrude
looking
wholly
out
of
place
and
spoil
it
all
making
the
thing
a
grating
discord
half
african
and
half
american
one
sunday
in
king
william's
town
a
score
of
colored
women
came
mincing
across
the
great
barren
square
dressed
oh
in
the
last
perfection
of
fashion
and
newness
and
expensiveness
and
showy
mixture
of
unrelated
colors
all
just
as
i
had
seen
it
so
often
at
home
and
in
their
faces
and
their
gait
was
that
languishing
aristocratic
divine
delight
in
their
finery
which
was
so
familiar
to
me
and
had
always
been
such
a
satisfaction
to
my
eye
and
my
heart
i
seemed
among
old
old
friends
friends
of
fifty
years
and
i
stopped
and
cordially
greeted
them
they
broke
into
a
good
fellowship
laugh
flashing
their
white
teeth
upon
me
and
all
answered
at
once
i
did
not
understand
a
word
they
said
i
was
astonished
i
was
not
dreaming
that
they
would
answer
in
anything
but
american
the
voices
too
of
the
african
women
were
familiar
to
me
sweet
and
musical
just
like
those
of
the
slave
women
of
my
early
days
i
followed
a
couple
of
them
all
over
the
orange
free
state
no
over
its
capital
bloemfontein
to
hear
their
liquid
voices
and
the
happy
ripple
of
their
laughter
their
language
was
a
large
improvement
upon
american
also
upon
the
zulu
it
had
no
zulu
clicks
in
it
and
it
seemed
to
have
no
angles
or
corners
no
roughness
no
vile
s's
or
other
hissing
sounds
but
was
very
very
mellow
and
rounded
and
flowing
in
moving
about
the
country
in
the
trains
i
had
opportunity
to
see
a
good
many
boers
of
the
veldt
one
day
at
a
village
station
a
hundred
of
them
got
out
of
the
third
class
cars
to
feed
their
clothes
were
very
interesting
for
ugliness
of
shapes
and
for
miracles
of
ugly
colors
inharmoniously
associated
they
were
a
record
the
effect
was
nearly
as
exciting
and
interesting
as
that
produced
by
the
brilliant
and
beautiful
clothes
and
perfect
taste
always
on
view
at
the
indian
railway
stations
one
man
had
corduroy
trousers
of
a
faded
chewing
gum
tint
and
they
were
new
showing
that
this
tint
did
not
come
by
calamity
but
was
intentional
the
very
ugliest
color
i
have
ever
seen
a
gaunt
shackly
country
lout
six
feet
high
in
battered
gray
slouched
hat
with
wide
brim
and
old
resin
colored
breeches
had
on
a
hideous
brand
new
woolen
coat
which
was
imitation
tiger
skin
wavy
broad
stripes
of
dazzling
yellow
and
deep
brown
i
thought
he
ought
to
be
hanged
and
asked
the
station
master
if
it
could
be
arranged
he
said
no
and
not
only
that
but
said
it
rudely
said
it
with
a
quite
unnecessary
show
of
feeling
then
he
muttered
something
about
my
being
a
jackass
and
walked
away
and
pointed
me
out
to
people
and
did
everything
he
could
to
turn
public
sentiment
against
me
it
is
what
one
gets
for
trying
to
do
good
in
the
train
that
day
a
passenger
told
me
some
more
about
boer
life
out
in
the
lonely
veldt
he
said
the
boer
gets
up
early
and
sets
his
niggers
at
their
tasks
pasturing
the
cattle
and
watching
them
eats
smokes
drowses
sleeps
toward
evening
superintends
the
milking
etc
eats
smokes
drowses
goes
to
bed
at
early
candlelight
in
the
fragrant
clothes
he
and
she
have
worn
all
day
and
every
week
day
for
years
i
remember
that
last
detail
in
olive
schreiner's
story
of
an
african
farm
and
the
passenger
told
me
that
the
boers
were
justly
noted
for
their
hospitality
he
told
me
a
story
about
it
he
said
that
his
grace
the
bishop
of
a
certain
see
was
once
making
a
business
progress
through
the
tavernless
veldt
and
one
night
he
stopped
with
a
boer
after
supper
was
shown
to
bed
he
undressed
weary
and
worn
out
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
in
the
night
he
woke
up
feeling
crowded
and
suffocated
and
found
the
old
boer
and
his
fat
wife
in
bed
with
him
one
on
each
side
with
all
their
clothes
on
and
snoring
he
had
to
stay
there
and
stand
it
awake
and
suffering
until
toward
dawn
when
sleep
again
fell
upon
him
for
an
hour
then
he
woke
again
the
boer
was
gone
but
the
wife
was
still
at
his
side
those
reformers
detested
that
boer
prison
they
were
not
used
to
cramped
quarters
and
tedious
hours
and
weary
idleness
and
early
to
bed
and
limited
movement
and
arbitrary
and
irritating
rules
and
the
absence
of
the
luxuries
which
wealth
comforts
the
day
and
the
night
with
the
confinement
told
upon
their
bodies
and
their
spirits
still
they
were
superior
men
and
they
made
the
best
that
was
to
be
made
of
the
circumstances
their
wives
smuggled
delicacies
to
them
which
helped
to
smooth
the
way
down
for
the
prison
fare
in
the
train
mr
b
told
me
that
the
boer
jail
guards
treated
the
black
prisoners
even
political
ones
mercilessly
an
african
chief
and
his
following
had
been
kept
there
nine
months
without
trial
and
during
all
that
time
they
had
been
without
shelter
from
rain
and
sun
he
said
that
one
day
the
guards
put
a
big
black
in
the
stocks
for
dashing
his
soup
on
the
ground
they
stretched
his
legs
painfully
wide
apart
and
set
him
with
his
back
down
hill
he
could
not
endure
it
and
put
back
his
hands
upon
the
slope
for
a
support
the
guard
ordered
him
to
withdraw
the
support
and
kicked
him
in
the
back
then
said
mr
b
'the
powerful
black
wrenched
the
stocks
asunder
and
went
for
the
guard
a
reform
prisoner
pulled
him
off
and
thrashed
the
guard
himself

to
me
the
most
interesting
convulsion
of
nature
in
south
africa
was
the
diamond
crater
the
rand
gold
fields
are
a
stupendous
marvel
and
they
make
all
other
gold
fields
small
but
i
was
not
a
stranger
to
gold
mining
the
veldt
was
a
noble
thing
to
see
but
it
was
only
another
and
lovelier
variety
of
our
great
plains
the
natives
were
very
far
from
being
uninteresting
but
they
were
not
new
and
as
for
the
towns
i
could
find
my
way
without
a
guide
through
the
most
of
them
because
i
had
learned
the
streets
under
other
names
in
towns
just
like
them
in
other
lands
but
the
diamond
mine
was
a
wholly
fresh
thing
a
splendid
and
absorbing
novelty
very
few
people
in
the
world
have
seen
the
diamond
in
its
home
it
has
but
three
or
four
homes
in
the
world
whereas
gold
has
a
million
it
is
worth
while
to
journey
around
the
globe
to
see
anything
which
can
truthfully
be
called
a
novelty
and
the
diamond
mine
is
the
greatest
and
most
select
and
restricted
novelty
which
the
globe
has
in
stock
the
kimberley
diamond
deposits
were
discovered
about
1869
i
think
when
everything
is
taken
into
consideration
the
wonder
is
that
they
were
not
discovered
five
thousand
years
ago
and
made
familiar
to
the
african
world
for
the
rest
of
time
for
this
reason
the
first
diamonds
were
found
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
were
smooth
and
limpid
and
in
the
sunlight
they
vomited
fire
they
were
the
very
things
which
an
african
savage
of
any
era
would
value
above
every
other
thing
in
the
world
excepting
a
glass
bead
for
two
or
three
centuries
we
have
been
buying
his
lands
his
cattle
his
neighbor
and
any
other
thing
he
had
for
sale
for
glass
beads
and
so
it
is
strange
that
he
was
indifferent
to
the
diamonds
for
he
must
have
pickets
them
up
many
and
many
a
time
it
would
not
occur
to
him
to
try
to
sell
them
to
whites
of
course
since
the
whites
already
had
plenty
of
glass
beads
and
more
fashionably
shaped
too
than
these
but
one
would
think
that
the
poorer
sort
of
black
who
could
not
afford
real
glass
would
have
been
humbly
content
to
decorate
himself
with
the
imitation
and
that
presently
the
white
trader
would
notice
the
things
and
dimly
suspect
and
carry
some
of
them
home
and
find
out
what
they
were
and
at
once
empty
a
multitude
of
fortune
hunters
into
africa
there
are
many
strange
things
in
human
history
one
of
the
strangest
is
that
the
sparkling
diamonds
laid
there
so
long
without
exciting
any
one's
interest
the
revelation
came
at
last
by
accident
in
a
boer's
hut
out
in
the
wide
solitude
of
the
plains
a
traveling
stranger
noticed
a
child
playing
with
a
bright
object
and
was
told
it
was
a
piece
of
glass
which
had
been
found
in
the
veldt
the
stranger
bought
it
for
a
trifle
and
carried
it
away
and
being
without
honor
made
another
stranger
believe
it
was
a
diamond
and
so
got
$125
out
of
him
for
it
and
was
as
pleased
with
himself
as
if
he
had
done
a
righteous
thing
in
paris
the
wronged
stranger
sold
it
to
a
pawnshop
for
$10
000
who
sold
it
to
a
countess
for
$90
000
who
sold
it
to
a
brewer
for
$800
000
who
traded
it
to
a
king
for
a
dukedom
and
a
pedigree
and
the
king
put
it
up
the
spout

i
know
these
particulars
to
be
correct
the
news
flew
around
and
the
south
african
diamond
boom
began
the
original
traveler
the
dishonest
one
now
remembered
that
he
had
once
seen
a
boer
teamster
chocking
his
wagon
wheel
on
a
steep
grade
with
a
diamond
as
large
as
a
football
and
he
laid
aside
his
occupations
and
started
out
to
hunt
for
it
but
not
with
the
intention
of
cheating
anybody
out
of
$125
with
it
for
he
had
reformed
we
now
come
to
matters
more
didactic
diamonds
are
not
imbedded
in
rock
ledges
fifty
miles
long
like
the
johannesburg
gold
but
are
distributed
through
the
rubbish
of
a
filled
up
well
so
to
speak
the
well
is
rich
its
walls
are
sharply
defined
outside
of
the
walls
are
no
diamonds
the
well
is
a
crater
and
a
large
one
before
it
had
been
meddled
with
its
surface
was
even
with
the
level
plain
and
there
was
no
sign
to
suggest
that
it
was
there
the
pasturage
covering
the
surface
of
the
kimberley
crater
was
sufficient
for
the
support
of
a
cow
and
the
pasturage
underneath
was
sufficient
for
the
support
of
a
kingdom
but
the
cow
did
not
know
it
and
lost
her
chance
the
kimberley
crater
is
roomy
enough
to
admit
the
roman
coliseum
the
bottom
of
the
crater
has
not
been
reached
and
no
one
can
tell
how
far
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
it
goes
originally
it
was
a
perpendicular
hole
packed
solidly
full
of
blue
rock
or
cement
and
scattered
through
that
blue
mass
like
raisins
in
a
pudding
were
the
diamonds
as
deep
down
in
the
earth
as
the
blue
stuff
extends
so
deep
will
the
diamonds
be
found
there
are
three
or
four
other
celebrated
craters
near
by
a
circle
three
miles
in
diameter
would
enclose
them
all
they
are
owned
by
the
de
beers
company
a
consolidation
of
diamond
properties
arranged
by
mr
rhodes
twelve
or
fourteen
years
ago
the
de
beers
owns
other
craters
they
are
under
the
grass
but
the
de
beers
knows
where
they
are
and
will
open
them
some
day
if
the
market
should
require
it
originally
the
diamond
deposits
were
the
property
of
the
orange
free
state
but
a
judicious
rectification
of
the
boundary
line
shifted
them
over
into
the
british
territory
of
cape
colony
a
high
official
of
the
free
state
told
me
that
the
sum
of
$4
00
000
was
handed
to
his
commonwealth
as
a
compromise
or
indemnity
or
something
of
the
sort
and
that
he
thought
his
commonwealth
did
wisely
to
take
the
money
and
keep
out
of
a
dispute
since
the
power
was
all
on
the
one
side
and
the
weakness
all
on
the
other
the
de
beers
company
dig
out
$400
000
worth
of
diamonds
per
week
now
the
cape
got
the
territory
but
no
profit
for
mr
rhodes
and
the
rothschilds
and
the
other
de
beers
people
own
the
mines
and
they
pay
no
taxes
in
our
day
the
mines
are
worked
upon
scientific
principles
under
the
guidance
of
the
ablest
mining
engineering
talent
procurable
in
america
there
are
elaborate
works
for
reducing
the
blue
rock
and
passing
it
through
one
process
after
another
until
every
diamond
it
contains
has
been
hunted
down
and
secured
i
watched
the
concentrators
at
work
big
tanks
containing
mud
and
water
and
invisible
diamonds
and
was
told
that
each
could
stir
and
churn
and
properly
treat
300
car
loads
of
mud
per
day
1
600
pounds
to
the
car
load
and
reduce
it
to
3
car
loads
of
slush
i
saw
the
3
carloads
of
slush
taken
to
the
pulsators
and
there
reduced
to
quarter
of
a
load
of
nice
clean
dark
colored
sand
then
i
followed
it
to
the
sorting
tables
and
saw
the
men
deftly
and
swiftly
spread
it
out
and
brush
it
about
and
seize
the
diamonds
as
they
showed
up
i
assisted
and
once
i
found
a
diamond
half
as
large
as
an
almond
it
is
an
exciting
kind
of
fishing
and
you
feel
a
fine
thrill
of
pleasure
every
time
you
detect
the
glow
of
one
of
those
limpid
pebbles
through
the
veil
of
dark
sand
i
would
like
to
spend
my
saturday
holidays
in
that
charming
sport
every
now
and
then
of
course
there
are
disappointments
sometimes
you
find
a
diamond
which
is
not
a
diamond
it
is
only
a
quartz
crystal
or
some
such
worthless
thing
the
expert
can
generally
distinguish
it
from
the
precious
stone
which
it
is
counterfeiting
but
if
he
is
in
doubt
he
lays
it
on
a
flatiron
and
hits
it
with
a
sledgehammer
if
it
is
a
diamond
it
holds
its
own
if
it
is
anything
else
it
is
reduced
to
powder
i
liked
that
experiment
very
much
and
did
not
tire
of
repetitions
of
it
it
was
full
of
enjoyable
apprehensions
unmarred
by
any
personal
sense
of
risk
the
de
beers
concern
treats
8
000
carloads
about
6
000
tons
of
blue
rock
per
day
and
the
result
is
three
pounds
of
diamonds
value
uncut
$50
000
to
$70
000
after
cutting
they
will
weigh
considerably
less
than
a
pound
but
will
be
worth
four
or
five
times
as
much
as
they
were
before
all
the
plain
around
that
region
is
spread
over
a
foot
deep
with
blue
rock
placed
there
by
the
company
and
looks
like
a
plowed
field
exposure
for
a
length
of
time
make
the
rock
easier
to
work
than
it
is
when
it
comes
out
of
the
mine
if
mining
should
cease
now
the
supply
of
rock
spread
over
those
fields
would
furnish
the
usual
8
000
car
loads
per
day
to
the
separating
works
during
three
years
the
fields
are
fenced
and
watched
and
at
night
they
are
under
the
constant
inspection
of
lofty
electric
searchlight
they
contain
fifty
or
sixty
million
dollars'
worth'
of
diamonds
and
there
is
an
abundance
of
enterprising
thieves
around
in
the
dirt
of
the
kimberley
streets
there
is
much
hidden
wealth
some
time
ago
the
people
were
granted
the
privilege
of
a
free
wash
up
there
was
a
general
rush
the
work
was
done
with
thoroughness
and
a
good
harvest
of
diamonds
was
gathered
the
deep
mining
is
done
by
natives
there
are
many
hundreds
of
them
they
live
in
quarters
built
around
the
inside
of
a
great
compound
they
are
a
jolly
and
good
natured
lot
and
accommodating
they
performed
a
war
dance
for
us
which
was
the
wildest
exhibition
i
have
ever
seen
they
are
not
allowed
outside
of
the
compound
during
their
term
of
service
three
months
i
think
it
is
as
a
rule
they
go
down
the
shaft
stand
their
watch
come
up
again
are
searched
and
go
to
bed
or
to
their
amusements
in
the
compound
and
this
routine
they
repeat
day
in
and
day
out
it
is
thought
that
they
do
not
now
steal
many
diamonds
successfully
they
used
to
swallow
them
and
find
other
ways
of
concealing
them
but
the
white
man
found
ways
of
beating
their
various
games
one
man
cut
his
leg
and
shoved
a
diamond
into
the
wound
but
even
that
project
did
not
succeed
when
they
find
a
fine
large
diamond
they
are
more
likely
to
report
it
than
to
steal
it
for
in
the
former
case
they
get
a
reward
and
in
the
latter
they
are
quite
apt
to
merely
get
into
trouble
some
years
ago
in
a
mine
not
owned
by
the
de
beers
a
black
found
what
has
been
claimed
to
be
the
largest
diamond
known
to
the
world's
history
and
as
a
reward
he
was
released
from
service
and
given
a
blanket
a
horse
and
five
hundred
dollars
it
made
him
a
vanderbilt
he
could
buy
four
wives
and
have
money
left
four
wives
are
an
ample
support
for
a
native
with
four
wives
he
is
wholly
independent
and
need
never
do
a
stroke
of
work
again
that
great
diamond
weighs
97l
carats
some
say
it
is
as
big
as
a
piece
of
alum
others
say
it
is
as
large
as
a
bite
of
rock
candy
but
the
best
authorities
agree
that
it
is
almost
exactly
the
size
of
a
chunk
of
ice
but
those
details
are
not
important
and
in
my
opinion
not
trustworthy
it
has
a
flaw
in
it
otherwise
it
would
be
of
incredible
value
as
it
is
it
is
held
to
be
worth
$2
000
000
after
cutting
it
ought
to
be
worth
from
$5
000
000
to
$8
000
000
therefore
persons
desiring
to
save
money
should
buy
it
now
it
is
owned
by
a
syndicate
and
apparently
there
is
no
satisfactory
market
for
it
it
is
earning
nothing
it
is
eating
its
head
off
up
to
this
time
it
has
made
nobody
rich
but
the
native
who
found
it
he
found
it
in
a
mine
which
was
being
worked
by
contract
that
is
to
say
a
company
had
bought
the
privilege
of
taking
from
the
mine
5
000
000
carloads
of
blue
rock
for
a
sum
down
and
a
royalty
their
speculation
had
not
paid
but
on
the
very
day
that
their
privilege
ran
out
that
native
found
the
$2
000
000
diamond
and
handed
it
over
to
them
even
the
diamond
culture
is
not
without
its
romantic
episodes
the
koh
i
noor
is
a
large
diamond
and
valuable
but
it
cannot
compete
in
these
matters
with
three
which
according
to
legend
are
among
the
crown
trinkets
of
portugal
and
russia
one
of
these
is
held
to
be
worth
$20
000
000
another
$25
000
000
and
the
third
something
over
$28
000
000
those
are
truly
wonderful
diamonds
whether
they
exist
or
not
and
yet
they
are
of
but
little
importance
by
comparison
with
the
one
wherewith
the
boer
wagoner
chocked
his
wheel
on
that
steep
grade
as
heretofore
referred
to
in
kimberley
i
had
some
conversation
with
the
man
who
saw
the
boer
do
that
an
incident
which
had
occurred
twenty
seven
or
twenty
eight
years
before
i
had
my
talk
with
him
he
assured
me
that
that
diamond's
value
could
have
been
over
a
billion
dollars
but
not
under
it
i
believed
him
because
he
had
devoted
twenty
seven
years
to
hunting
for
it
and
was
in
a
position
to
know
a
fitting
and
interesting
finish
to
an
examination
of
the
tedious
and
laborious
and
costly
processes
whereby
the
diamonds
are
gotten
out
of
the
deeps
of
the
earth
and
freed
from
the
base
stuffs
which
imprison
them
is
the
visit
to
the
de
beers
offices
in
the
town
of
kimberley
where
the
result
of
each
day's
mining
is
brought
every
day
and
weighed
assorted
valued
and
deposited
in
safes
against
shipping
day
an
unknown
and
unaccredited
person
cannot
get
into
that
place
and
it
seemed
apparent
from
the
generous
supply
of
warning
and
protective
and
prohibitory
signs
that
were
posted
all
about
that
not
even
the
known
and
accredited
can
steal
diamonds
there
without
inconvenience
we
saw
the
day's
output
shining
little
nests
of
diamonds
distributed
a
foot
apart
along
a
counter
each
nest
reposing
upon
a
sheet
of
white
paper
that
day's
catch
was
about
$70
000
worth
in
the
course
of
a
year
half
a
ton
of
diamonds
pass
under
the
scales
there
and
sleep
on
that
counter
the
resulting
money
is
$18
000
000
or
$20
000
000
profit
about
$12
000
000
young
girls
were
doing
the
sorting
a
nice
clean
dainty
and
probably
distressing
employment
every
day
ducal
incomes
sift
and
sparkle
through
the
fingers
of
those
young
girls
yet
they
go
to
bed
at
night
as
poor
as
they
were
when
they
got
up
in
the
morning
the
same
thing
next
day
and
all
the
days
they
are
beautiful
things
those
diamonds
in
their
native
state
they
are
of
various
shapes
they
have
flat
surfaces
rounded
borders
and
never
a
sharp
edge
they
are
of
all
colors
and
shades
of
color
from
dewdrop
white
to
actual
black
and
their
smooth
and
rounded
surfaces
and
contours
variety
of
color
and
transparent
limpidity
make
them
look
like
piles
of
assorted
candies
a
very
light
straw
color
is
their
commonest
tint
it
seemed
to
me
that
these
uncut
gems
must
be
more
beautiful
than
any
cut
ones
could
be
but
when
a
collection
of
cut
ones
was
brought
out
i
saw
my
mistake
nothing
is
so
beautiful
as
a
rose
diamond
with
the
light
playing
through
it
except
that
uncostly
thing
which
is
just
like
it
wavy
sea
water
with
the
sunlight
playing
through
it
and
striking
a
white
sand
bottom
before
the
middle
of
july
we
reached
cape
town
and
the
end
of
our
african
journeyings
and
well
satisfied
for
towering
above
us
was
table
mountain
a
reminder
that
we
had
now
seen
each
and
all
of
the
great
features
of
south
africa
except
mr
cecil
rhodes
i
realize
that
that
is
a
large
exception
i
know
quite
well
that
whether
mr
rhodes
is
the
lofty
and
worshipful
patriot
and
statesman
that
multitudes
believe
him
to
be
or
satan
come
again
as
the
rest
of
the
world
account
him
he
is
still
the
most
imposing
figure
in
the
british
empire
outside
of
england
when
he
stands
on
the
cape
of
good
hope
his
shadow
falls
to
the
zambesi
he
is
the
only
colonial
in
the
british
dominions
whose
goings
and
comings
are
chronicled
and
discussed
under
all
the
globe's
meridians
and
whose
speeches
unclipped
are
cabled
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
he
is
the
only
unroyal
outsider
whose
arrival
in
london
can
compete
for
attention
with
an
eclipse
that
he
is
an
extraordinary
man
and
not
an
accident
of
fortune
not
even
his
dearest
south
african
enemies
were
willing
to
deny
so
far
as
i
heard
them
testify
the
whole
south
african
world
seemed
to
stand
in
a
kind
of
shuddering
awe
of
him
friend
and
enemy
alike
it
was
as
if
he
were
deputy
god
on
the
one
side
deputy
satan
on
the
other
proprietor
of
the
people
able
to
make
them
or
ruin
them
by
his
breath
worshiped
by
many
hated
by
many
but
blasphemed
by
none
among
the
judicious
and
even
by
the
indiscreet
in
guarded
whispers
only
what
is
the
secret
of
his
formidable
supremacy
one
says
it
is
his
prodigious
wealth
a
wealth
whose
drippings
in
salaries
and
in
other
ways
support
multitudes
and
make
them
his
interested
and
loyal
vassals
another
says
it
is
his
personal
magnetism
and
his
persuasive
tongue
and
that
these
hypnotize
and
make
happy
slaves
of
all
that
drift
within
the
circle
of
their
influence
another
says
it
is
his
majestic
ideas
his
vast
schemes
for
the
territorial
aggrandizement
of
england
his
patriotic
and
unselfish
ambition
to
spread
her
beneficent
protection
and
her
just
rule
over
the
pagan
wastes
of
africa
and
make
luminous
the
african
darkness
with
the
glory
of
her
name
and
another
says
he
wants
the
earth
and
wants
it
for
his
own
and
that
the
belief
that
he
will
get
it
and
let
his
friends
in
on
the
ground
floor
is
the
secret
that
rivets
so
many
eyes
upon
him
and
keeps
him
in
the
zenith
where
the
view
is
unobstructed
one
may
take
his
choice
they
are
all
the
same
price
one
fact
is
sure
he
keeps
his
prominence
and
a
vast
following
no
matter
what
he
does
he
deceives
the
duke
of
fife
it
is
the
duke's
word
but
that
does
not
destroy
the
duke's
loyalty
to
him
he
tricks
the
reformers
into
immense
trouble
with
his
raid
but
the
most
of
them
believe
he
meant
well
he
weeps
over
the
harshly
taxed
johannesburgers
and
makes
them
his
friends
at
the
same
time
he
taxes
his
charter
settlers
50
per
cent
and
so
wins
their
affection
and
their
confidence
that
they
are
squelched
with
despair
at
every
rumor
that
the
charter
is
to
be
annulled
he
raids
and
robs
and
slays
and
enslaves
the
matabele
and
gets
worlds
of
charter
christian
applause
for
it
he
has
beguiled
england
into
buying
charter
waste
paper
for
bank
of
england
notes
ton
for
ton
and
the
ravished
still
burn
incense
to
him
as
the
eventual
god
of
plenty
he
has
done
everything
he
could
think
of
to
pull
himself
down
to
the
ground
he
has
done
more
than
enough
to
pull
sixteen
common
run
great
men
down
yet
there
he
stands
to
this
day
upon
his
dizzy
summit
under
the
dome
of
the
sky
an
apparent
permanency
the
marvel
of
the
time
the
mystery
of
the
age
an
archangel
with
wings
to
half
the
world
satan
with
a
tail
to
the
other
half
i
admire
him
i
frankly
confess
it
and
when
his
time
comes
i
shall
buy
a
piece
of
the
rope
for
a
keepsake
conclusion
i
have
traveled
more
than
anyone
else
and
i
have
noticed
that
even
the
angels
speak
english
with
an
accent
pudd'nhead
wilson's
new
calendar
i
saw
table
rock
anyway
a
majestic
pile
it
is
3
000
feet
high
it
is
also
17
000
feet
high
these
figures
may
be
relied
upon
i
got
them
in
cape
town
from
the
two
best
informed
citizens
men
who
had
made
table
rock
the
study
of
their
lives
and
i
saw
table
bay
so
named
for
its
levelness
i
saw
the
castle
built
by
the
dutch
east
india
company
three
hundred
years
ago
where
the
commanding
general
lives
i
saw
st
simon's
bay
where
the
admiral
lives
i
saw
the
government
also
the
parliament
where
they
quarreled
in
two
languages
when
i
was
there
and
agreed
in
none
i
saw
the
club
i
saw
and
explored
the
beautiful
sea
girt
drives
that
wind
about
the
mountains
and
through
the
paradise
where
the
villas
are
also
i
saw
some
of
the
fine
old
dutch
mansions
pleasant
homes
of
the
early
times
pleasant
homes
to
day
and
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
their
hospitalities
and
just
before
i
sailed
i
saw
in
one
of
them
a
quaint
old
picture
which
was
a
link
in
a
curious
romance
a
picture
of
a
pale
intellectual
young
man
in
a
pink
coat
with
a
high
black
collar
it
was
a
portrait
of
dr
james
barry
a
military
surgeon
who
came
out
to
the
cape
fifty
years
ago
with
his
regiment
he
was
a
wild
young
fellow
and
was
guilty
of
various
kinds
of
misbehavior
he
was
several
times
reported
to
headquarters
in
england
and
it
was
in
each
case
expected
that
orders
would
come
out
to
deal
with
him
promptly
and
severely
but
for
some
mysterious
reason
no
orders
of
any
kind
ever
came
back
nothing
came
but
just
an
impressive
silence
this
made
him
an
imposing
and
uncanny
wonder
to
the
town
next
he
was
promoted
away
up
he
was
made
medical
superintendent
general
and
transferred
to
india
presently
he
was
back
at
the
cape
again
and
at
his
escapades
once
more
there
were
plenty
of
pretty
girls
but
none
of
them
caught
him
none
of
them
could
get
hold
of
his
heart
evidently
he
was
not
a
marrying
man
and
that
was
another
marvel
another
puzzle
and
made
no
end
of
perplexed
talk
once
he
was
called
in
the
night
an
obstetric
service
to
do
what
he
could
for
a
woman
who
was
believed
to
be
dying
he
was
prompt
and
scientific
and
saved
both
mother
and
child
there
are
other
instances
of
record
which
testify
to
his
mastership
of
his
profession
and
many
which
testify
to
his
love
of
it
and
his
devotion
to
it
among
other
adventures
of
his
was
a
duel
of
a
desperate
sort
fought
with
swords
at
the
castle
he
killed
his
man
the
child
heretofore
mentioned
as
having
been
saved
by
dr
barry
so
long
ago
was
named
for
him
and
still
lives
in
cape
town
he
had
dr
barry's
portrait
painted
and
gave
it
to
the
gentleman
in
whose
old
dutch
house
i
saw
it
the
quaint
figure
in
pink
coat
and
high
black
collar
the
story
seems
to
be
arriving
nowhere
but
that
is
because
i
have
not
finished
dr
barry
died
in
cape
town
30
years
ago
it
was
then
discovered
that
he
was
a
woman
the
legend
goes
that
enquiries
soon
silenced
developed
the
fact
that
she
was
a
daughter
of
a
great
english
house
and
that
that
was
why
her
cape
wildnesses
brought
no
punishment
and
got
no
notice
when
reported
to
the
government
at
home
her
name
was
an
alias
she
had
disgraced
herself
with
her
people
so
she
chose
to
change
her
name
and
her
sex
and
take
a
new
start
in
the
world
we
sailed
on
the
15th
of
july
in
the
norman
a
beautiful
ship
perfectly
appointed
the
voyage
to
england
occupied
a
short
fortnight
without
a
stop
except
at
madeira
a
good
and
restful
voyage
for
tired
people
and
there
were
several
of
us
i
seemed
to
have
been
lecturing
a
thousand
years
though
it
was
only
a
twelvemonth
and
a
considerable
number
of
the
others
were
reformers
who
were
fagged
out
with
their
five
months
of
seclusion
in
the
pretoria
prison
our
trip
around
the
earth
ended
at
the
southampton
pier
where
we
embarked
thirteen
months
before
it
seemed
a
fine
and
large
thing
to
have
accomplished
the
circumnavigation
of
this
great
globe
in
that
little
time
and
i
was
privately
proud
of
it
for
a
moment
then
came
one
of
those
vanity
snubbing
astronomical
reports
from
the
observatory
people
whereby
it
appeared
that
another
great
body
of
light
had
lately
flamed
up
in
the
remotenesses
of
space
which
was
traveling
at
a
gait
which
would
enable
it
to
do
all
that
i
had
done
in
a
minute
and
a
half
human
pride
is
not
worth
while
there
is
always
something
lying
in
wait
to
take
