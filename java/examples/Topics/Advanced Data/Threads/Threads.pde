/**
 * Thread function example
 * by Daniel Shiffman.  
 * 
 * This example demonstrates how to use thread() to spawn
 * a process that happens outside of the main animation thread.
 *
 * When thread() is called, the draw() loop will continue while
 * the code inside the function passed to thread() will operate
 * in the background.
 *
 * For more about threads, see: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Threading
