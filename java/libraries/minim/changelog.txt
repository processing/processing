Changelog!

Version 2.0.2

Fixed Bugs:

+ filenames were being parsed incorrectly by createRecorder.

+ fixed audio processing routines for AudioPlayer and AudioSnippet so that 
  they don't spend cycles doing nothing while not in the "play" state.
  
+ fixed the zombie thread bug, which kept audio processing Threads from 
  exiting when close() was called.

+ fixed out-of-memory problems that could occur when large files were 
  played. this does come at the cost of slower seek times.
 
+ fixed the isEnabled(AudioEffect) function, which, uh, wasn't working.

+ fixed the pan() function, which was returning the BALANCE control.

New Features:

+ added functions to FFT for doing forward transforms with an offset:
  forward(float[] samples, offset) and forward(AudioBuffer samples, offset)
  
+ added a freqToIndex(float freq) method to FFT for finding out the index 
  of the spectrum band that contains the passed in frequency.
  
+ added a stop() method to AudioSample, so that playing samples can be 
  immediately silenced.

+ added setPanNoGlide(float pan) to Controller, which will snap the panning
  setting of a sound to the provided value.

+ added setInputMixer(Mixer) and setOutputMixer(Mixer), which allow you to
  specify which Java Mixer object should be used when obtaining inputs (AudioInput) 
  and outputs (AudioOuput, AudioPlayer, AudioSnippet, AudioSample).
