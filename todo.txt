X only allow one pmouseX update outside of loop
X   to avoid jumping lines (drawing -> continuous_lines)
X   email glen/amit/creas about the change
X can windows have multiple jre installed and use any of them?
o another odd NullPointerException -> or just a "couldn't delete" problem
o  http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1060341518
o java vm could be removed from cvs
o   in favor of requiring a specific jvm, and using registry to find
X see if mods to PdeCompiler work on windows
X remove "couldn't delete.." messages
X modify how size() works
X   allow size() to be called multiple times
X   only works once in applet
X   be able to set size() later in the program
X   but still maintain other features like background
X   make the BGraphics constructor less fragile
X     and also more open to being resized when not in applet mode

X if there's a bug in bagel, PdeRuntime.message() ignores it
X   just says "NullPointerException" but provides no info
X   now at least spews the exception 
X removed ugly white borders from ui on macosx java 1.3
X   is there anything better that can be done for osx java 1.3
X   setInsets() to zero or something?
X font.stringWidth -> font.width(char c) or width(String s) 
X removed extra push()/pop() in text(String s) that may save time
X bezier error, goes up at the end
X   also when using bezierMode, doesn't draw the first vertex
X   size(300,200);
X   bezier(0,100,width/3,100,2*width/3,100,3*width/3,100);

X add note to tga spec
X   http://organicbit.com/closecombat/formats/tga.html
X screenGrab() shouldn't allocate a new pixel buffer
X   just write things out directly
X   also fix for the new targa code
X added a note about needing forward slashes
X   In the config file, the sketchbook path works if you use forward
X   slashes, but not if you use unescaped backslashes.
X draw mode issues.. size and background must be int/float constants
X   might be a better 'mode' for bagel so bkg and size cmds work
X   rather than app being enclosed in beginFrame/endFrame loop
X modify background() to actually clear the screen
X   modify readme.txt regarding background() requiring constants
X remove notes from reference about size/background
X remove notes from readme about size/background
X change the naming of the two versions of calc_color
X The web page for ellipse (reference/ellipse_.html) talks about
X   rectangles in the parameter list instead of ellipses.
X resize() name is bad because it overrides component..
X   resize is maybe goofy, so just size() for all?
X color() with alpha now works properly
X removed SMOOTH_IMAGES
X removed shearX and shearY
X toxi image code (!) 
X   need background(BImage) and scaling, copy area, etc.
X vertex(x, y, u, v) and vertex(x, y, z, u, v)
X don't cast color()
X   since more important for color(v1, v2, v3) to work
X getPixel/setPixel -> get/set.. 
X   get(x, y, w, h) is nice but no set(x,y,w,h)
X   though set(x,y,w,h) could be nice
X   and copy() to copy a section of pixels
X BImage.save()
X   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1062076172
X resize should call background again to set color
X   if background was set before the resize
X   and the background is not an image (or should it just stretch?)
X     no need for image, since it has to be same size
X     and is only explicitly drawn when background() is called
X BGraphics subclasses BImage
X   inherits all image manipulation and image use methods
X background(BImage)
X   also creating background image inside setup()
X images drawn from center don't work for simage()
X   currently calling slower image routine
o make zbuffer available instead of g.zbuffer
o shape.. non-homogenous colors for beginShape()
o   currently disabled b/c homogenousColors not set false for vertices
X should image(img, x, y, alpha) work instead of using fill?
X   write tint() command
X   or maybe another word for fill/stroke.. apply? colorize?

HIGH (to be completed for 0060)
_ QTJAVA path and CLASSPATH are weird if java not first installed
_   or just get set improperly, reinstalling quicktime doesn't help
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1063012751;start=0


MEDIUM
_ light(x, y, z, c1, c2, c3, TYPE)
_   also BLight with same constructor, and on() and off() fxn
_ mousePressed, keyPressed, others.. queue them all
_   queue multiple times
_ net problems
_   when you stop the client, it freezes 
_     until you quit the processing running the server
_   The server starts and stops fine.
o modify antlr stuff to conditionally recompile in make.sh
_   compile antlr inside the initial setup of the work dir
X     done for macosx
_     fix this for windows and linux
o   only recompile if asked or if changes
_ modify build instructions for the many changes
_   i.e. buzz.pl requires jdk13+ set for JDK13 flag, used by p5
_   usually need to remove the 'work' dir
_ better 1.3/1.4 support.. properly detect vm
_   use when deciding which classes to import
_ if size() not found in export/compile, ask the user
_   need to use oro matcher when trying to grab the applet size (export?)
_   size(myWidth, myHeight) -> set static var in BGraphics
_     for the last size that was used, use as default for fill-in field
_ better support for running locally
_   code to read from properties file from param()
_     for application mode or while inside the environment
_     these properties will be written to html on export
_   fix link, loadStrings, saveBytes code once that's fixed
_   saveBytes not in proper dir is annoying

dh b _ ability to export 'applications' (not just applets)
dh b _   lock feature for present mode (part of export to application?)
dh b _   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
dh b _   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
dh b _   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
dh b _   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works
dh b _   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
dh b _   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
dh b _     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
dh b _   also make sure pack() is happening
dh b _   add manifest.mf to exported applets so that applications will work
dh b _     http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1045983103;start=0
bf b _   BApplet.main(new String[] { "flashcards3" });
bf b _     or even BApplet.main(new String[] { getClass().getName() });
bf b _     META-INF/MANIFEST.MF contains just "Main-Class: ClassName"
bf b _     main sticking point will be serial/qtjava in exports


LOWER (post beta tweaks, non-structural)
_ clean up PdeTokenMarker, probably just alphabetize
_ remove .DS_Store boogers, especially from win/linux distributions
_ NullPointerException when alt is pressed
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1061802316;start=0
_ check what other functions require BGraphics to exist but shouldn't
_ color has to be called inside or after setup
_ loadImage must be used inside or after setup

_ include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_   or rename the old applet folder to something else?
_ don't allow apostrophe (i.e. casey's_cells) when naming sketch!
_ screenGrab() at the end of a draw mode program is problematic
_   app might exit before the file has finished writing to disk
_   need to block other activity inside screenGrab until finished
_ non-ascii filenames seem to be causing trouble
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1062794781;start=0
_ need to change all the copyrights over to mit "except where noted"
X when exporting applet, line numbers will be off.. 
_   when not exporting with new preproc code, imports all on same line
_   make preproc keep track of how many lines were added
_ fix the problem causing all the "couldn't delete" messages
_ help->reference and find in reference don't work on some machines
_   complaints from osx and windows..
X when exporting applet, line numbers will be off.. 
_   when not exporting with new preproc code, imports all on same line
_   make preproc keep track of how many lines were added
_ class naming from dan
_   If you name a class the same name as the sketch project, 
_   you get an error about contained classes with duplicate names 
_   when you try to export for web.
_ catch security exceptions around applet i/o calls
_   not just for saving files, but provide better error msgs when
_     attempting to download from another server
_ change .vlw.gz fonts to just .vlw but still gzip compress
_   reader code should just catch the exception if they're not gzipped
_   and try to re-download them
_ if (loop == false) and (draw == false) then provide an error
_   so user knows that one or the other is needed
_ building releases from scratch 
_   this is a useful developer task before release
_     build all releases from a clean cvs
_   tries to make work/ without bagel serial existing and blows up
_     b/c bagel checkout happens later
_   all code needs to be buildable from scratch
_ make PdeEditorStatus modal
_   problem on quit (using JOptionPane as a band-aid)
_   also a problem because user can use the ui while prompt is visible
_   needs proper blocking, the way Dialog.show() does
_   so that that status window can be used while quitting
_   (currently cannot because it quits before getting response)
_   tried to pop up a modal Dialog in exactly the same location
_     but couldn't remove the decoration from the window (jvm bug?)
_     because it just quit without finishing


VOLUNTEER TASKS
_ need bezierTangent() code


INTERNAL
_ add constants for building NET, move stuff around in bagel dir
_ internal naming of _fill, image_mode, textureOrientation
_   these all need to jive better with one another
_   ie. perhaps just 'fill', so that it can be used for a get
_ look at ken perlin renderer code


NEW GRAPHICS
_ stroke not set on flat_rect
_ when drawing fonts w/ sami's code, left edge has problem
_   8-bit (alpha) textures not blending 
_ near-plane clipping currently disabled for triangles, enabled for lines
_   (but culling offscreen triangles works.. but may have been
_   commented out by carlos)
_ sphere code needs only front face polygon 
_   all triangles must be counter-clockwise (front-facing)

_ video.pixels don't seem to have high bytes set
_   so fill(video.pixels[blah]) doesn't work
_   test against 'pixels' example
_ make BVideo subclass BImage

bf b _ set decent fonts (probably same as editor above), looks bad on mac
bf b o   remove the border around the edge
bf b o   what's with the 2 blank lines on startup?


macosx
_ random lockups seem common in 1.4
_ test more to see if runtime exceptions are coming through
_ track down error in PdeCompiler for message parsing
_   was missing the error about a package being gone
_   comment out /System/Library/ code to track that down
b _ set nice background for disk image on macosx
b _ Contents/Resources/Java can take jnilib files


linux
_ can't find jikes, so users have to put it in their PATH
_   dmose may have fixed this
_ doesn't seem interested in quitting properly (?)
_ switch to swing menus, because motif widgets are nasty


thesis / acg
bf _ make bagel more usable as standalone
bf _   breakout BGraphics (have its own BImage)
bf _   breakout BApplet into BComponent ? (fix out-of-bounds mouse)
bf _   possible use of BUtils ?
bf _   write documentation on general use
bf _     along with how to download from sourceforge (anonpass is blank)
bf _   needs to be used as a component, without applet 
bf _   but retain functionality, ie. image i/o
bf _   exports pixels or a BImage or does MemoryImageSource itself
bf _   move math functions into utility library associated
bf _     with bagel, because those will be useful on other bagel platforms
bf _     pApplet will call BagelMath.whatever, so still looks like cos()
bf _   #ifdef to remove client and server code as well
bf _   p5 classes into packages (bagel especially)
bf _     http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1052908285;start=0
bf _ break out BSerial as separate object like BVideo
bf _   include rxtx and the rest of that setup in subfolder
bf _   BSerial.flush and BSerial.available in object
bf _ need to resolve issues between rendering screen/file
bf _   illustrator-based rendering needs to work for ars projects
bf _   screen may be 400x400 pixels, but file be 36x36"
bf _ opengl export / rendering mode
bf _   currently implemented, but somewhat broken
bf _   finish this once all the line code is done
bf _ make possible to use buzz.pl to create versions w/ stuff removed
bf _ build gl4java for java 1.4
bf _ read table/csv formatted data into a matrix
bf _   pseudo-database format version of this that stores indexes to file
bf _     rather than loading the whole thing at once
bf _ more advanced splitting of files into rows/cols uses another class
bf _   other class also has concept for random access of lines
bf _   by storing the line positions, can access without loading all
bf _   into memory because some files will be too large
bf _ illustrator export / rendering mode
bf _   also postscript or pdf export?
bf _   version of Illustrator.java that uses bagel api
bf _   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
bf _   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
bf _     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
bf _   version of BApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.

..................................................................


things attempted for beta but found to be too time consuming, and of
low enough importance that they'll be fixed after beta.

1 _ don't force install of qtjava
1 _   this requires a separate version of bagel that doesn't use video
1 _   or a version that loads video dynamically. that kinda sucks.
1 _   maybe could even compile it in with jikes? (blech)


things for post-beta, to be sorted through later

1 _ history causing trouble
1 _   super slow with a huge sketch
1 _ winamp/audio getting starved or crackly while applets running
1 _   thread priority too high? or something weird
1 _ don't cache stuff from loadStrings and others
1 _   mac java vm won't give up old version of file
1 _   or use setUseCaches(false)
1 _ multi-line errors a mess in jikes
1 _   maybe a dropdown list thing, with the first just shown?


..................................................................



_ ide: type-ahead/teaching functions -> how useful for learning?
_ multiple error messages from jikes, little turner to scroll thru


ed
_ quality of compiler errors + multiple errors
_ additional class files.. .java or .pde
_ find/replace

juha
_ documenting how the environment works / is set up

amit
_ find/replace
_ println speed improvements
_ 'debug' that shows a variable (rather than many many println)
_ tabs for multiple files

zach
_ setting breakpoints / stepping through
_ useful as understanding for how program works
_ tracing like director

schoenerwissen
_ tracing variables
_ bspace object
_ 7 day search on discourse board


..................................................................


api work

_ merge BImage/BGraphics into BLayer/Pixels ?
_ update() mode should be finished before beta

_ for int i for 0 to b.length
_ for i from 0 upto b.length

ugly but no ideas yet
_ serialWrite -> sprint ? 
_ noSmooth
_ noFill()
_ rectMode means rectPlacement
_   becomes a problem when strokeMode and strokeWidth are mixed
_ beginRect() beginLineLoop() et al. ?

_ begin/end.. beginSerial/endSerial -> 
_   openSerial/closeSerial ?
_   startSerial/stopSerial
_ need some model for i/o that makes more sense
_   getting whole words from serial, network, and files
_   or buffers of specific length with a sync byte
_ split to take strings (ie. for ", ")
_ quicksort should probably just be made into 'sort' class
_   it's the only one ever used
_   can this be done using an inner class?

_ should BSpace be included?
_ go through examples to see if there's other annoying syntax


additions that i want
_ image(BImage, x, y, float scale) (found in illustrator stuff)
_ textrect(String text, x, y, width, height)  // based on rectMode
_   textMode() for align left, center, right (no justify.. har!)
_ file i/o: file listing util that leaves out . and ..
_ rotateRight(), rotateLeft(), flipHorizontal().. etc
_   for an actual 'transformations' object
_ write tiff (or other) header for image stream


..................................................................


// notes on an implementation of a 'shape' class..
// as long as using an additional pde file...

..to still maintain rect() instead of g.rect()
..and the rest of the p5 features

// shape or "processing" means to add all kinds of methods like:
// public void point(float x, float y) {  g.point(x, y);  }
// and that the class 'implements' ShapeInterface..
//
shape class Something {

  void setup() {
    // not used, or called on first draw

    // but maybe required (even if behind the scenes) 
    // so that this can use "implements ShapeInterface"
  }

  void draw() {  // uses internal g. that's been set by parent
  }
}


in the .pde parent:

void loop() {
  shape(somethingInstance);
}

where the shape() method in BApplet looks like:

shape(ShapeInterface o) {
  o.graphics(this.g);  // has to be a method, since intf
  o.draw();
}

GRAPHICS LIBRARY

A hybrid of OpenGL (3D Graphics) and some aspects of Postscript (Fill, Stroke)
The graphics library is called Bagel, which is an internal name.


BAGEL / Rendering

   b _ picking
   b _   what is the API for picking?
   b _   ability to write data other than image into the buffer
   b _   user can introduce new kinds of buffers at will (!)
   b _   lists of names of objects, or the 'line number' buffer
   b _   but how to determine *where* on object the hit occurs

ca b _ lines
ca b X   rewrite line and stroke code, it's a buggy mess
ca b X     lines become 2 pixels thick after a 3D transform 
ca b X     better handling of single-pixel special case
ca b _       flat_line_retribution is a hack, can go away
ca b _   setting stroke width on circle makes odd patterns
ca b X     line endcaps and line joins. strokeMode()
ca b _       lower priority, but at least leave room
ca b ?   make sure line() commands don't try to have a fill
ca b _   box is not opaque
ca b X     problem is that lines are drawn second
ca b X     one pixel lines have no z value.. argh
ca b X     bug re: 3d depth sorting on lines
ca b _     http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1043894019;start=0
ca b _

ca b _     translate(58, 48, 0); 
ca b _     rotateY(0.5);
ca b _     box(40);

ca b X concave/complex polygon
ca b _   eventually POLYGON auto-detects convex/concave polygon
ca b _   also add POLYGON_CONVEX and POLYGON_CONCAVE
ca b X clipping objects (clipping planes?)
ca b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1058491568;start=0
ca b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1052313604;start=0
ca b X   things are flying into the camera and halting apps
ca b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1042699742
ca b X   NullPointerException apparently when things way offscreen
ca b _     i.e. glyphrot with scale set to 4
ca b _     or at least that things get ridiculously slow
ca b _     clipping issues here.. but also something in scan converter
ca b X     not clipping areas from offscreen
ca b _       huge geometry slows things way down

bf b _ font support is overkill and sucks
bf b _   need fast 2D text that's not affected by the transforms
bf b _   also needs to look good, not squished from texture weirdness
bf b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1051806272

   1 _ toxi ellipses don't adapt for larger sizes


BAGEL / Serial

   b _ basic usb support?
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1053684925


BAGEL / Details

   1 _ what is the stroked version of a sphere? a circle?
   1 _ non-homogenous coloring for curve vertices
   1 _   properly interpolate
   1 _ too many push() will silently stop the applet inside a loop
   1 _ test winding polygons in different directions
   1 _ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
   1 _ better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
   1 _ is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
   1 _   may be correct, it worked for nik
   1 _ inside draw() mode, delay() does nothing
   1 _   delay might be a good way to signal drawing to the screen/updating


BAGEL / Future

   2 _ cartesian/polar conversion
   2 _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1053354853
   2 _   thread includes code for the 2D case
   2 _ alter strokeWidth in LINE_STRIP
   2 _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1053795842;start=0
   2 _ keypressed is not persistent
   2 _   key repeat in os vs. how java handles it
   2 _   search java faq for info about getting around it
   2 _ drawMode() for MULTIPLY and ADD
   2 _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1051208333
   2 _ nicer/simpler api for moving the camera around
   2 _ better api for fonts
   2 _ fixed fonts are screwed, should only work at screen resolution
   2 _   getStream for the filename doesn't work for directories
   2 _     getfont("fonts/blah.fbf") refers to blah.raw, but that
   2 _     also needs to be searched for in the fonts/ dir..
   2 _ try with 1.4 frame buffer stuff to see if it's faster
   2 _ write shearing function
   2 _ optimize rotation functions
   2 _ update/noUpdate() could also be done to force explicit updates only
   2 _   for ui-type applications that don't need to continually redraw
   2 _   instead use void update() as a function like loop and draw
   2 _   third mode for interactive apps that have to be queried
   2 _   shouldn't do so much work (redrawing in loop) if waiting for input
   2 _     mode for when no full animation taking place
   2 _     otherwise machine is continually maxed out while app is running
   2 _ way to screen grab at higher resolution
   2 _   method for rendering at higher res and then scaling down
   2 _   (even if this causes signficant performance hit)
   2 _ look at GLUT for other needed shapes
   2 _ export to static flash-based graphics
   2 _ build in second matrix type: 2d affine
   2 _ write code for reading uncompressed b/w tiff images
   2 _   incorporate for fixed width fonts
   2 _ fast(er?) version of bagel that just uses java graphics
   2 _   but leaves out many features
   2 _ setting a fill color when drawing an image should affect the image
   2 _   or maybe image.setColor or setTone to mix a specific color in

PDE - Processing Development Environment



PDE / Pre-preprocessor 
Currently using Oro for search and replace preprocessor,
but Dan Mosedale is moving us to ANTLR

dm b _ additional data conversions to avoid this syntax:
dm b _   Integer.toString(), Integer.parseInt()
dm b _   works like class casting: int(23.4) same as ((int) 23.4) 
dm b _   String(1234) -> translates to String.valueOf(1234);
dm b _     works for all data types that support valueOf
dm b _     i.e. valueOf(Object) returns null or Object.toString() 
dm b _   int("1234") -> Integer.parseInt("1234")
dm b _   float("1234.35") -> (new Float("1234.35").floatValue())
dm b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1060940705

dm b _ foreach implementation, ala java 1.5 spec
dm b _   http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/tiger/enhanced-for.html
dm b _   for (String s : c) { ... }
dm b _   or example for sum of int array:
dm b _   int sum = 0; for (int e : a) { sum += e; }

   b _ for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) -> for (int i < 10) (?)
   b _    what's a better method for this?

   b _ allow import blahblah.blah.blah to get passed through
   b _   and included with the imports list.

   b _ check through all the examples to look for other themes

dm b _ subst Image -> BImage, Font -> BFont
dm b _   this should be optional until we get the naming down
dm b _ contextual syntax highlighting based on grammar
dm b _   everything that's in java.lang plus more is too much for keywords
dm b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1045665326


Current Preprocessor Subsitutions:

"compiler.substitute_floats" (currently "substitute_f")
- treat doubles as floats, i.e. 12.3 becomes 12.3f so that people
  don't have to add f after their numbers all the time. this is
  confusing for beginners.

"compiler.enhanced_casting"
- byte(), char(), int(), float() works for casting. this is basic in
  the current implementation, but should be expanded as described
  above. color() works similarly to int(), however there is also a
  *function* called color(r, g, b) in p5. will this cause trouble?

"compiler.color_datattype"
- 'color' is aliased to 'int' as a datatype to represent ARGB packed
  into a single int, commonly used in p5 for pixels[] and other color
  operations. this is just a search/replace type thing, and it can be
  used interchangeably with int.

"compiler.web_colors" (currently "inline_web_colors")
- color c = #cc0080; should unpack to 0xffcc0080 (the ff at the top is
  so that the color is opaque), which is just an int. 

Other preprocessor functionality

- detects what 'mode' the program is in: static (no function brackets
  at all, just assumes everything is in draw), active (setup plus draw
  or loop), and java mode (full java support). 
  http://proce55ing.net/reference/environment/index.html

- size and background are pulled from draw mode programs and placed
  into setup(). this has a problem if size() is based on a variable,
  which we try to avoid people doing, but would like to be able to
  support it (perhaps by requiring the size() to be final?)

- currently does a godawful scrambling of the comments so that the
  substitution doesn't try to run on them. this also causes lots of
  bizarro bugs.

Possible?

- would be nice to just type code wherever, mixing a 'static' style
  app with a few functions. would be simpler for starting out. but it
  seems that the declarations would have to be pulled out, but that
  all seems problematic. or maybe it could all be inside a static { } 
  block. but that wouldn't seem to work either.


PDE / Runtime (includes classloading)

dh b _ environment locks up when error stream isn't for the class
dh b _   this happens when it's another thread (i.e. image fetcher)

dh b _   but makes no error.. peditorconsole probably swallowing it
dh b _ ability to include other code from sketchbook directory
dh b _   compile entire sketchbook on startup, check for new files on compile?


PDE / Editor
if you dream it, you can do it.

dh b _ find/replace
dh b _   ctrl-f for find, g for find next, h for next occurrence of selected
dh b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1055003940
