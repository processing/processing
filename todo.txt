The com.apple.eio.FileManager now has two new desktop interaction methods, revealInFinder(File) and moveToTrash(File). You can use revealInFinder() to open a Finder window in the parent directory of of a file and select it. You can use moveToTrash() to move a file to the most appropriate Trash directory for the volume that contains that file.

o        <key>LSUIPresentationMode</key>
o        <integer>4</integer> 
o errors with serial and libraries
Exception in thread "Thread-2" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
processing/core/PApplet
    at processing.serial.Serial.<init>(Serial.java:156) 
generally, that error means that something is missing from the
CLASSPATH. the NoClassDefError gives erroneous feedback about *what*
class is actually missing, as of java 1.3+ (yay!)
so perhaps conflicting versions of a library in the sketchbook (solve
this by setting to an empty sketchbook temporarily) or files might be
installed in the CLASSPATH variable or something conflicting in
/System/Library/Extensions.

X the word from Apple on Info.plist setup
X   DO NOT USE "JVMArchs". It is deprecated, and manually overrides the natural architecture launching and ordering that LaunchServices does, including accommodating the 32-bit checkbox in the Get Info window.

_ figure out why modes are not loading classes properly

_ First doubleclick immediately closes example folder
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1150

with casey
_ does editor.bgcolor live in the theme.txt file for the mode? 
_   or should it be a user preference thing
_   for that matter, need to decide on how much modes can customize themselves
_ find in reference for copy() (on image) tries to open PVector.copy()
_   might need disambiguation pages?
_   if a reference page is missing, throws a bunch of exceptions
_   i.e. PVector.copy() not in the reference
_ specifically add "eclipse" to integration description
_ link books and sample chapters from the "getting started" portion of the faq
_ keep examples.zip in a zip file? (5000 files @ 30 MB instead of 15 MB zip)
_   mark examples as untitled (rather than read-only)
_   maybe even pull these directly from the zip file?
_ load examples from zip files
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=143
_ disallow add file to sketch, export, export application
_   pretty much anything inside the sketch?
_   but don't do this with untitled, cuz it kinda stinks
_   this is too weird--just put examples into individual zip files
_   mark example files as untitled
_   though will that require the sketch to be saved before export?


2.0 / command line
_ kill external editor (for all its quirks) in favor of command line? 
_   use external editor needs to enable/disable across all windows
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=515
C   Casey says yes kill ext editor and finish command line
_ use as a way to remove the non-GUI-specifc code from PApplet
_   so that the builds can run headless
_ processing.app.Commander headless still requiring X11
_   problem is static calls to PApplet
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=220
X could move to java6 and better internal javac support (drop ecj)
_   decided to use Java 6, so check on Javac usefulness
_ change command line to just be part of regular (separate) distros
_   there's so much platform code in there, it's not worth the extra work
_   also include update check for logging
_ command line support is currently broken
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=142
_   some fixes can be found in the bug report
_   need to deal with setting path to sketchbook/examples
_   also deal with the script not being in the right folder


more open/save/etc
_ blank sketch opened even if another opened by double-click
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=179
_ also can have case of opening two of same sketch at once
_   if sketch was open, then restart by dragging the .pde to p5.app
_ osx not opening a sketch at all on double-click? (though opening the app)
_ active editor not being set null
_   in Base.nextEditorLocation(), changed to "editors.size() == 0" 
_   instead of (activeEditor == null), but that's papering over a problem
_   where the active editor is not being set null
_ don't let people into the /tmp folder for sketches
o   don't use tmp folder for sketches? 
_   restrict more things like "show sketch folder"
_   don't allow adding files w/o saving
_   others?

_ work on making GSOC stuff work better with unpatched editor
_   currently using createTextArea() hack inside Editor

_ force indentation - implement an option for beginners especially
_ indents and loops
_   or make the area light up gray as it's being worked on
_ common error messages
_   with a proper list, we can add links when throwing an error in the PDE

_ write up code guidelines for project (in advance of GSoC)
_ write up guidelines for modes
_   i.e. don't mess with Sketch menu, put it in the mode menu

export/launcher
_ use launch4j for export and p5 app itself
_   perhaps even calling it through an ant task
_ switch the exported launcher to use launch4j as well? 
_ better exe export.. maybe using jexegen or launch4j
_ use launch4j when exporting applications for windows
_ windows exported exe problems (pcho)
_   unexplainable problems with apps not starting up
_ lib folder goes missing from export, give an error
_   also any .jar files that are missing, give an error
_   showing more debug messages (command line?)

_ build is currently broken for fresh checkout due to changes to file layout
_   something that gets fixed by 'make clean'
_   also test on windows and linux

_ errors that cannot be placed (i.e. missing brace) 
_   this makes things to jump to the last tab
_   also happens with stray characters sometimes...
_   casey: accidentally typing a letter at the top of the tab
_     throws you onto the end of the last tab... exactly the worst location
_ jer: omitting a semicolon shows the error on the line after it...
_ find across all tabs (jer request)

_   fonts by default not working that well?
_ jer: opengl2 tutorial

regressions
_ strange window flicker when first opened
_ test libraries on android
_ test .java files on desktop version

_ when creating a sketch within non-java mode, should write the settings file
_   so that it re-loads in the proper environment
_ examples window sketches should load in proper environment

ugliness
_ inside AndroidPreprocessor
_   processing.mode.java.JavaBuild.scrubComments(sketch.getCode(0).getProgram())
_   PApplet.match(scrubbed, processing.mode.java.JavaBuild.SIZE_REGEX);
_ remove PdeKeyListener, roll it into the Java InputHandler for JEditTextArea
_ move Java-specific InputHandler to its own subclass
_ remove any reference to 'Editor' from Sketch.java
_   or is that excessive, since Document is in there, etc
_   Build does the heavy lifting anyway...
_ TextAreaDefaults
_   is editable in use?
_   what's electricScroll?
_   caretBlinks always true.. just remove the pref?
_   blockCaret always false.. remove it?
_ EditorToolbar, two TODO items for open menu handling

blob of mess
_ modes have their own methods for digging through sketch & libraries folders
_   therefore it need only check the sketch.txt file to see if it's ok
_   (between android and java) 
_   but more importantly, if it's something totally different (.py) then
_   that'll be ok, and work fine
_   need another extension for the p5 py stuff
_ android mode will make no attempt to figure out which of your sketches are relevant... however you can add the sketch.txt file (sketch.properties?) to the directory if you want to be specific about it.
_ idea of examples, libraries, reference built into the base system
_ look through web/java_generate to see how the doc stuff works
_ work through andres' pshape changes to smooth things out
_ post videos online of the android work
_ don't make examples read-only
_   just do them from psk files

_   antlr.jar in the classpath will cause trouble.. 
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1138652326
_   jogl jar files, or jogl install will cause trouble
_     /System/Library/Java/Extensions or /Library/Java/Extensions
_     the /System one contains qtjava
_     the /Library one is empty (by default), maybe skip it?
_ classpath conflicts also problem with PDE itself
_   catch antlr conflicts, and put up an error message
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1225 (no Google issue)
_ when a conflicting library is found, need to report it
_   altho prolly only when it's actually different (md5hash it?)
_   this seems to be causing a lot of trouble with recent releases
_   (opengl changes and whatnot)
_ jar files like the bad aiexport plugin will cause serious problems
_   need to ignore processing.core classes showing up in other jar files
_   tougher than it looks, because it all depends on what java wants to use
_     i.e. even if not specified, the stuff will be in the classpath
_   need to make classpath code be less promiscuous
_   the order of adding libraries to classpath should be opposite
_     the important local libraries should be first in cp, user contrib later
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=56
_ changing the sketchbook folder will make libraries show up
_   but it won't reload the library mapping table
_ make sure there aren't library jar files named the same thing 
_   i.e. if one library has db.jar, then that's gonna kill another db.jar

_ when are prefs saved? could instead save whenever changes are made
_   and then if the file gets modified, it'll put up an error message
_   also, this may be part of why other sketches aren't reloading properly
_ add a 150 ms or more lag before opening the untitled window (on os x)
_ Editor.applyFrame() may not have a valid 'editor' object to work with
_   if windows closed, and prefs altered, NPE thrown
_ clear up prefs so that multiple editors don't trash each other's prefs
_ make sure editor isn't trying to apply prefs when no editor is open

_ explanation of how we see libraries in the PDE
_   We're making an assumption that the idea of a "library" refers to a block of Java-based code. The reasoning is that from within the PDE, we anticipate that it will be Java-compatible versions of other languages (such as Jython, JRuby, or Scala) as opposed to more generic languages. In the future we could open this up, but we'd rather not complicate things for the moment.

DOC / Text

_ how to use textMode(SHAPE) with opengl
_   things will be extremely slow (fix later)
_   things will also be very ugly on-screen
_ text being nicer in java2d
_   use createFont() to load the font or use a font from your machine
_   note that createFont() is no good for applets/export to web
_ textMode(SCREEN) for P2D and P3D for nice fast text in screen space
_   currently slow in JAVA2D and OPENGL, but this will improve
_ what is the vlw font file format?
_ shapes from 3D type
_   the way to do it (will improve later) is to use some undocumented features  
_   1) you have to use the OPENGL renderer 
_   2) use textMode(SHAPE); 
_   3) use createFont() (which you already are) 
_   this will convert all the shape data from the fonts for writing. 
_   it will be *extremely* slow, which is part of why it's not documented yet. 
_   but it will work with beginRaw().


DOC / Discourse Board

_ auto-close threads when not posted to for 30(?) days
_ add basic guidelines for posting to the board
_   0. be polite. going on about how much something "sucks" or is "stupid" will make you look like an eight-year-old.
_   1. don't double (or triple) post
_   2. if you're having trouble, first see the troubleshooting page
_   3. if you have a bug, first search the bugs database
_   4. first check the FAQ
_   5. use the search bar at the top of every page
_   6. read revisions.txt
_ someone wrote up an initial version of this
_ how to put [code] around blocks of code
_   also mention contributed plugin for formatting
_   also the reference page on the bb commands
_ i don't answer to instant messages
_ i don't answer email
_ use the bugs db instead of the bugs board
_ use the search box (not the forum search)

PDE / Dialogs

_ proper dialog support
_   http://javagraphics.blogspot.com/2008/06/joptionpane-making-alternative.html
_ two-tiered dialogs for everything - use big font/little font style throughout
_   http://javagraphics.blogspot.com/2008/06/joptionpane-making-alternative.html
_ option to suppress warning dialogs
_   starting with the one about modifying the sketch name for spaces
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=7
_ the first time someone hides a tab, put up a msg explaining what it does
_   "don't warn me about this anymore"
_ add "don't warn me about this" for sketch renaming
_   make sure renamed version doesn't exist already
_ prompt user before nuking applet or application folders
_   along with a "don't ask me later"
_ use macosx dialogs for all of the editor stuff
_   see about doing the same on windows, linux?
_   the others seem to respond ok to the lucida grande since they use defaults
_   vista style dialogs
_     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb328626.aspx
_   confirmation dialogs (save and don't save.. who'd a thunk it)

PDE / Compiler & Preprocessor

need examples
_ Improve detection and handling of missing semicolons
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=136

medium (bugs/features)
_ mismatched square brackets generate bizarre and/or misleading error messages
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=355
_ with additional .pde files, don't allow static mode in front tab
_   e.g. no setup()/draw() block
_ don't allow "for (blah; blah; blah) ;"
_   or if (blah blah blah) ;
_   it's never useful. students can use { } if they want an empty block
_ missing brackets, unmatched brackets
_   examples added to the bug report
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=6

low (features)
_ copy running code from /tmp/buildXXxxx on crash of p5
_   should probably make a way to save/recover code
_   make the buildXxxx folders relate to time/date?

low (common errors around reserved names/class naming)
_ Saving sketch with the same name as a class or primitive breaks sketch
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=157
_ don't allow people to override methods like paint() 
_   make them final? just improve the error messages?
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1020
_ Processing chokes if a sketch defines a class with same name as the sketch
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=157

_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=5
_ using a keyword as a variable name gives unhelpful error message
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=54

low (better error messages)
_ need better error messages in general
_   some means to link out to further documentation (e.g. AIOOBE, NPE)
_ if 'void' left out before loop or setup, cryptic message about
_   'constructor loop must be named Temporary_23498_2343'
_   add a better handler for this specific thing?
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=8


PDE / Editor

_ cmd-shift-n not creating new tab
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=149
_ improve update check message "a new release (1.0.1) is available"
_   be more descriptive, use a second line in latest.txt
_   maybe just include the full text of the update message there?
_ go through other sketch-opening menus to check for disappearing sketches
_ deal with isManagingFocus() warning in the editor src
_ [LaunchRunner Error] processing.app.Base.main(String[]) threw an exception
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=821
_ strange NullPointerException problem prevents launch
_   some kind of NPE in handleOpenInternal and friends
_   appears to be a synchronization problem with the loading
_ when opening from double-click on the mac, doesn't replace untitled
_   or in general, issues between opening new window and another launching
_   probably need to synchronize the file open methods inside Base
_   (could in fact cause nastiness with editors[] access)
_ editors opening up at the same time on load?
_   either synchronize the open (at a minimum)
_   or wait for mac handlers to register an open event
_   can also cause problems with opening multiple copies of same sketch
_ after fixing name of sketch, ensure sketch of that name does not exist
_ add auto-save to the editor
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=739
_ dragging title bar while sketch running causes strange selection behavior
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=504
_ add mnemonics for menus (alt-f to open 'file')
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=12
_ option to just print all code in project
_   option to export all the code as colored html
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=28
_ "page setup" sucks in java
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=435
_ dim edit menus as appropriate during selection/no selection/etc
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=33
_ fonts smaller than 10 cause problems in the editor
_   generally causes trouble on osx
_   on windows and linux, changing the size throws things off
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=51
_ code coloring is imperfect because it's not based on a parser
_   i.e. mousePressed() is red but mouseMoved() is brown
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=113
_ implement emacs keybindings (list is at the bug report)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=401
_ implement better method of showing curly brace closure
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=295
_ sketches should only write to the console of their editor window
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=921
_ problems with file/print
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1230


PDE / Editor Buttons

_ run button not properly unhighlighting
_   does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
_   also when using draw() instead of loop()
_     applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38
_   check 'finished' via objectreference?
_ make the run button highlight immediately
_   or maybe show an animation for starting up
_   rather than post-compile
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=776
_ if export fails (compile error) need to un-highlight the export button
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=39


PDE / Editor Header

_ key command for prev/next tab works, but not menu
_   menu options are actually disabled because of inconsistency
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=140


PDE / Editor Status

_ make standard editor input prompt available to other tools/modes
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=746
_ error messages run off the edge and go invisible
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=57
_ move all prompts to modal dialog showError/Message/Warning/Prompt
_   nicely design dialog boxes to go with visual of p5
_   maybe something that shows stack trace?
_   with an 'email this' button? (include source code too?)
_   also need a "prompt" dialog for asking filenames, etc
_   implement and remove PdeEditorStatus stuff
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=59


PDE / Export

_ when exporting to application (or applet) don't copy .java files from folder
_   (they'll be copied as source files later)
_   make .java files and friends go to correct locations on export (app)
_ warn on export when people call their sketches things like Server
_ warn if someone extends PApplet but mis-names the sketch
_   or don't allow it to be exported
_   add bug reference to the faq once added to the db
X   or at least add a note about this to the faq
_ show error when no main() is included but class extends PApplet
_   error can happen or be checked 
_ errors during export don't show up properly (no red status bar)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=194
_ exporting application copies .java files 
_   .java files are copied to the root folder as well as the source folder


PDE / Find & Replace

_ allowing to find & replace over multiple tabs 
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=25


PDE / Preferences

_ separate prefs and sketch state info?
_   this would mean prefs being rewritten far less
_ prefs window doesn't swap ok/cancel properly for mac vs. windows/linux
_   don't bother having a "cancel" for the prefs window
_ rewrite preferences window to use proper layout?
_   is there already a bug for this?
_ make prefs dialog modal?
_ prefs window not visible on windows taskbar
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=438
_ split Preferences and PreferencesFrame?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74
_ preferences window has been hit with the ugly stick
_   redo panel to use proper Box layout etc
_   also needs to look good across all platforms
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=73
_ make available the background colors for present mode, stop button color
_   isolate color chooser into a simpler/smaller class outside tools
_   then can also use from inside processing applications as well
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=75
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1130781367;start=2#2
_ add ability to set the display where present mode makes things start
_   code is already in, need to add window and test with multi-monitor setup
_   some code already written in PresentMode.java
_ option in preferences to set the jvm used to run? (osx only?)
_   this would take care of nasty macosx 1.4 vs 1.5 issues
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.3.1/Commands/java
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.2/Commands/java
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Commands/java
_   canonical path for 
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK
_   will return 1.5.0 (or maybe 1.6 for others?)


PDE / Runner 

_ draw mode apps do not shut off the run button when finished
_   need to talk to VM and read when 'finished' var is set
_ does closing the window call stop()?
_   need to make sure hitting stop button and closing window explicitly call
_   set finished to true, then join() the animation thread
_ need to set dock icon title on osx


PDE / Present 

_ need to decide how to handle "stop" button in present mode
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=63
_   when running externally, people need to write their own stop function
_   just get export to application working so this can be supported
_   for now, they're stuck w/ running in the env and getting the ugliness
_ quitting from present mode doesn't kill run button
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ ArticulatePrint-070103a.pde from ArticulatePrint-070103a loads ok
_   but when opening the sketch, it leaves out the file
_   because there's a dash in the name
_   and instead only loads StemCell.pde
_ show progress dialog during export and save
_ slow save/new because of large sketchbook
_   this is a total cluster, the rebuild is being called incessantly
_   startup is very slow on g4
_   show progress bar while rebuilding sketch menu?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1162801212
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1141126582
_   even more of a problem becase set modified set true all the time
_   in 0125, only rebuilding on rename or save as, but still a problem
_   don't re-scan all jar files whenever rebuilding sketch menu (cache)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=579
_ in rebuild sketch menu - disable subfolders working as libraries
_   if a sketch, don't allow subfolders
o   or maybe just that libraries must be in the root? 
o   nah, cuz that would mean can't make subfolder called "libraries"
_ is the 'hide' option for code dumb? i've never used it
_   should it just hide the code, not actually remove it?
_ do we finish the tabs thing for 1.0? yes
_   could probably be done in a reasonable simple way.. ala eclipse
_   show additional tabs in the dropdown list? show all?
_ robert's tunnel example, why does tunnel not show up as leftmost tab?
_ hitting ESC on "create this, move file, continue" opened anyway
_ may need a progress bar for "save as"
_   or just the file copy function in general
_   since it may take a long time (i.e. 1000s of screen grabs)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=82
_ "save as" shouldn't always show save as dialog
_   unless that's the current mode that's being used
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=83
_ handle renaming with case changes (currently ignores case change)
_   see notes/bitching in Sketch.nameCode()
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=85
_ setting sketchbook to a folder on a network mounted drive
_   does this work? test on both on mac and pc.. 
_   or if not, should recommend people against it 
_   (i.e. folders disappearing if net has trouble)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=87
_ some type of sketch archive format for posting examples (.psk?)
_   would be nice to open a sketch directly from a zip file
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=88
_   maybe just open from a zip file, since psk doesn't help anything
_   also have a means of importing sketches

TOOLS / General

_ need a proper means to handle command keys for tools (?)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=140
_ need method for showing prefs for the tools (?)
_   i.e. add pref to handle date vs. increment on archive sketch
_   tools that need prefs will show their own GUI anyway
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=883
_ handle native code for tools menu (?)

TOOLS / Movie Maker

_ move Movie Maker out to its own separate tool package (with separate build)
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=837


TOOLS / Ideas 

_ eclipse import/export
_   simple mechanism to export to eclipse
_     don't worry about subversion stuff, just export with libraries
_   something clever to import back from eclipse
_   could keep the .svn files in with the libs and all
_   then when exporting for eclipse, people can update as necessary
_   -> dan et al say better to do fixed versions and have it work simply
_ import sketch from url (takes a zip from archive sketch)
_ archive sketch direct to bug report
_ shared code
_   Integrator / FloatThing / CameraStuff -- Update
_   to pull code from a local folder
_   update will update classes from shared in the current folder



TOOLS / Color Selector

_ pasting into color picker doesn't update the color values
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503


TOOLS / Auto Format

_ fix autoformat to indent like the p5 book/examples
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=325
_ extra indent found
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1003
_ Switch block cases not indented
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1004
_ do a better job of maintaining cursor 
_ only auto-format a particular section of code
_   set the 'tabs' var based on how many spaces on previous line

DIST

How the environment gets packed up, downloaded, and installed.


DIST / General 

_ drag and drop
_   including the number of items added to sketch would be especially nice
_ implement automatic update
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=374
_ need .pde document icons
_ need .psk file icon
_ need exported application icons
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known bugs'
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known suggestions'
_ write notes about running p5 on another platforms 
_   this was some feedback from running on bsd:

_   need to use the 1.3 vm, and get a fake platform name
_   otherwise, goes looking for lib/pde_.properties or something
_ about box 
_   bring up information about gpl, lgpl, and ibmpl
_   jedit syntax is under mit license
_     http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
_ different name for 'lib' folder because of libraries folder?
_   avoid some confusion for when describing the libraries folder to users

_ retina support
Have you added an NSPrincipalClass to your Info.plist, and are using a JavaApplicationStub with 64-bit?
<key>NSPrincipalClass</key>
<string>NSApplication</string>
Check out the desktop property. Unfortunately, it won't tell you *which* display is running in HiDPI, but it will stay up-to-date with live display changes (like a Retina-display being plugged and unplugged). If you query the property after each GraphicsEnvironment display change event, you should be able to live switch in and out of HiDPI.
java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getDesktopProperty("apple.awt.contentScaleFactor");
_ cut/copy/paste while saving a sketch on goes to the editor, not save dialog

_   problem with focus traversal and native windows on OS X
_   using JFileChooser fixes the problem (but is ugly)
_ setup() and draw() are not bold on osx (10.4)
_   likely osx refuses to do monaco bold
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1047
_ if someone has monaco disabled in font book, the app won't start
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=562
_ we're breaking some mac human interface guidelines
_   should be using a menu factory to create menubar for all sub-windows
_   http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2042.html
_   and the general warning dialogs are just ass ugly
_   (i.e. we really need those replacements for JOptionPane)
o track down error in PdeCompiler for message parsing
o   was missing the error about a package being gone
o   can comment out /System/Library/ as a test
X   way too old to know this one
_ put stdout/stderr into ~/Library/Logs
_   and have a .log extension so it can be browsed properly
_   need to make sure that it's ok to write to logs dir..
_      probably being removed from future OS X versions
_ try LSMinimumSystemVersion in Info.plist
_ Horizontal two finger scroll doesn't work in OS X
_   also applies to horizontal scrolling on the mouse
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1046
_ Exiting a sketch with Command-Q or File > Quit doesn't call stop() on OS X
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1069
_ add a check to make sure that people aren't running from the dmg
_   doesn't actually cause any problems, so don't bother?
_ code to hide menubar.. just include JNA and call from there?
NSMenu.setMenubarVisible(false);
Then we used Cocoa via JNI:
if([NSMenu menuBarVisible]){
	[NSMenu setMenuBarVisible:NO];
}
You can't do that from the AWT event thread. You need to do a -performSelectorOnMainThread to do that on the AppKit event thread.
Please see <http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2005/tn2147.html> for more information, particularly the section about "Calling AppKit from AWT/Swing".


DIST / Linux

_ finish up debian package support (see the processing.mess folder)
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=75
_   these bits need to be checked to ensure that they work on other distros
_ Editor stops receiving keyboard input after running a program (8.10)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1161
_ not being able to make a link to the processing app
_   argh.. more path and shell issues..
_ splash screen


3.0 and later

_ Replace current editor with more advanced version
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1032
_ better text editor / live debugging (integrate Eclipse JDT)
_   line numbers
_   it's too difficult for students to debug their code
_     can the jdt be hooked in somewhat easily?
_ get rid of static mode? only setup/draw mode? or create project that way?
_   pro: simplify internal code, fixes some of the worst errors
_   con: people love it, most of the books use it heavily
_ add === for String.equals()
_   might be problematic since it might be opposite the javascript meaning
_   jer: it's a decent time to start talking abt references/vars
_ window menu
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=545
_ restoring sketches
_   save window positions on quit, and restore them (w/ a preference?)
_     new windows use same mode and dimensions as topmost window
_   saved window position problematic with multiple monitors
_     http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=27
_   Closing the last window doesn't cause PDE to save it's position/contents/etc
_     http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=103
_   not remembering window size/placement preferences
_     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=837
_   Blank sketch opened even if opening an existing sketch by double-clicking
_     http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=179
_   changing number of screens between run causes things to show up off-screen
_     so when running, check to make sure that things are out of the area
_   saved window positions.. if displays has changed, becomes a problem
_     record the display that it was on?
_       GraphicsDevice gd = frame.getGraphicsConfiguration().getDevice();
_     make sure the application is within the bounds of the current display?
_     (from 0, 0 to width, height)
_     messy since some displays have negative coords
_     http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=27
_ rename location is awkward, do it on the tab?
_ Resurrect the Eclipse plug-in project
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=1031
