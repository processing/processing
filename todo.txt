_ not slice() but subset()... get word from casey on how to resolve
_ update faq on site? what's difference between versions?


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


_ move the useful serial buffering fxns into net library

_ tab to just indent lines properly, 
_   rather than having it convert to spaces

_ check for updates should happen only daily or weekly

_ setup bugzilla and enter all the bugs

_ placement of 100x100 items is odd
_   happens with P3D and maybe also P2D?

_ if in full java mode
_   if extends PApplet.. or rather, put PApplet cast into a 
_   try/catch block.. if it doesn't work, try applet. if that
_   doesn't work, try using the class' main() to run it

_ println() can hose the app for the first 20-30 frames
_   need to figure out threading etc

_ not confirmed to be a bug
Is it possible that saving with the 'save' button doesn't pay
attention to where you point at the project folder from prefs?  Jeez,
i phrased that horribly.  I opened preferences for Processing and made
the default sketchbook location processing-0079/projects.  I then put
all my older projects in that project folder.  When i opened up an old
file and made changes, i then hit 'save' and quit.  I relaunched v79
and opened the aforementioned file, and none of the changes were
there.  but they were in v77 project folder. 

_ stop() not working very well
_   doesn't seem to actually be stopping things
_ closing window w/o first hitting stop() causes freak out
_   opengl gives an OutOfMemoryError
_   java2d just goes into a lock
_   could also be code that's in an infinite loop (i.e. text error) 
_     which then causes a full lock
_ something really bad happened with println() in this release
_   perhaps only without a code folder and/or running in java2d mode?
_   this may also be what's hosing 

Not sure what triggers it, possibly scrolling with mousewheel?, but
sometimes Processing output window gets stuck thinking it should
scroll to the top, so if you have an output larger than the allowable
space, it will show you the last line, but then pops the scrollbar
back to the top.  I think the only way to stop it is to quit out of
processing and relaunch. 

_ saveFrame() directly to quicktime via port of DbnRecorder
_   do this after beta, not likely to work with java 1.4 on macosx

_ saved window positions.. if displays has changed, becomes a problem
_   record the display that it was on?
_     GraphicsDevice gd = frame.getGraphicsConfiguration().getDevice();
_   make sure that the applet is within the bounds of the current display?
_   (from 0, 0 to width, height)

_ make note that changing screen config requires restart of processing
_   static { checkScreens(); }
_   static void PApplet.checkScreens() { } 
_   to run explicitly later
_   this seems too complicated.. just make people restart

_ more javadoc for the stuff inside processing.app

_ ability to select monitor via preferences panel
_   this applies to any applet that's run externally currently (verify)
_   make it also work with anything that's run inside of p5 itself
_ check current present code with multiple monitors

_ first pass on full screen
_   exceptions in full screen mode will quit the app completely
_   (can't keep window open because things are hosed)
_   default is that full screen app doesn't cover multiple displays
_     this is fine since opengl can't usually go across both
_     but include an example for how to use full in gl 
_     (use toolkit.getscreensize)

_ runtime exceptions have stopped coming through (on pc only?)

_ npe is a runtimeex, so any npe in setup comes up weird
_   maybe the renderer exception is something different? newrendex?

_ why is gl being added on export, no matter what? or is it?
_   sketch folder not really being emptied on export
_   so old libs will just perpetuate themselves

_ external apps don't stop at all when 'stop' is hit
_   worker thread is halting the app ala code folder bug
_   could this be dealt with by using nio? 
_     host environment will be running 1.4 so...

_ moving an external window around a lot will halt the parent
_   does move even need to be called? could just wait till stop?
_   PdeMessageSiphon has problems with message()
_ external apps also seem to not do newlines properly on exceptions
_ appendText launches a new thread for every blip of text
_   this is totally wrong and really horks things

_ split Preferences and PreferencesFrame ?

_ lock the minimum size for the main processing editor frame
_   if it's made too small, stuff from the bottom disappears

_ properly handle ENTER, Ctrl-W and ESC on all dialogs
_   there must be a proper "swing" way of doing this that doesn't
_   involve adding key listeners to every friggin component
_   ESC should fake a cancel button press
_   ENTER should do the default option
_   (might be a matter of setting the default action for the window?)

_ when running as external applet, hide the editor text area
_ drag & drop implementation to add files to sketch

_ remove jvm from cvs
_   use wget to grab it if it doesn't exist
_   and include an md5hash to see if the file is correct

_ straighten out int() -> toInt() conversion in the preproc

_ move build scripts to something better like ant
_   too much to maintain the multiple versions, no dependencies, too much code

_ some type of sketch archive format for posting examples (.psk?)
_   would be nice to open a sketch directly from a zip file

camera
_ pause and framerate aren't working
_ when passing in 'null' as the camera, dialog pops up fine
_   but the applet craps out after a few seconds (pinwheel spin)
_ couldn't get req'd component also happens when the camera isn't ready
_   may also mean that no camera is plugged in
_   also, don't mention winvdig on the mac
_ if user cancels prompt, throws a '-128,userCanceledErr'
_   in which case, need to return null (or ""?) for the prompt
_   which will also just give you the last camera
_   should it be new Camera(PROMPT);
_ error messages from quicktime not coming through very well

check these errors to see if they still exist
_ odd error in System.err stream coming from running external
_   dies after a while or goes weird
_   make sure exceptions with .class work
_ openStream returning 'null' really horked up the letters applet
_   no System.out was coming through
_   System.err was getting cut off before finishing

_ add prompt() method to Serial (simple dialog box that pops up)

_ subfolders in the 'data' directory don't work

_ don't allow goofy case versions of reserved words
_   keypressed should maybe throw an error

_ mouse wheel broken in the text editor? (windows jdk 1.5?) 


......................................................................


PROBLEMS FOR NEW USERS
_ making it easier to draw shapes
_ missing semicolons - better error message
_ missing brackets, unmatched brackets
_ "unexpected token void" -> "You're mixing dynamic and static mode"
_ forgetting the quotes around strings
_ separate reference for /dev version
_ loadImage() mixed case problems
_ loadImage() using spaces in the name
_   if loadImage() when online(), throw an error
_ files not in the data folder (works in env, not in sketch)
_ angleMode(DEGREES) -> mistyped keywords, caps being wrong
_ NullPointerException on unterminated comment at end of code
_   (and OutOfMemoryError and weird lockup)
_ not enough args for triangle (or args in general) 
_   throws out bizarre message 
_ document for new users:
_   what's a NullPointerException
_   use of strings
_   println() for debugging


TALK TO CASEY ABOUT...
o no transformations before background() is called
o   implementation specific, may cause trouble
o must call depth() for 3D applications
_ lights cannot be enabled/disabled throughout 
_   lighting will be based on what's left at endFrame()
X images should be a power of 2, or call modified()
X document the use of "die" 
X   can override the method to do your own handling
X sketches no longer require a "data" folder
X example that uses loop/noLoop, or redraw?
_ talk to creas about making html files for bugs, readme, revisions.
_   or how they should relate to the 'faq'.. readme -> faq? 
_ make a sketch that shows loading from the web
_ make another sketch that shows loading from a file
_ make notes about preproc
_   move the readme stuff for each file into the files themselves
_   also put a general rundown of the preproc into Preprocessor.java
_   subclasses need to use "public void keyPressed" not "void keyPressed"
_ write a threading example
X   or handle this some more intelligent way, super.stop() is needed.
X   registerDispose() does the trick

_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1067383998
_ write an example that uses Hashtable
_ and another that uses Vector
_ beginShape() defaults to beginShape(POLYGON)
_   needs to be noted for the reference
_ make a note that u/v coordinates clamp at 0 and 1
_ get an xml library and example in there
_   nanoxml problems with manifest
_   appears to use 1.6.8 version since it's just two classes

_ different name for 'lib' folder because of libraries folder?
_   avoid some confusion for when describing the libraries folder to users

_ implement new version of history
_   make history folder, and a zip (not gz) file for each entry
_   history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_     could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_     along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_     no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_     checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_     history converter option?
_   only first 20 entries visible?
_   zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)

_   shortcut to walk through history, ala photoshop (ctrl-alt-z)


editor tools menu
_ make dynamically loaded plugins and "tools" menu
_   break out beautify as its own plugin
_ make beautify plugin "Auto Format"
_   //for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
_   } catch (IOException e) { }
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1086555381

_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1067309918;start=0
_   ignores colons for case statements
_   need to tie this to the parser instead
_   do a better job of maintaining cursor during beautify 
_   only beautify a particular section of code
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217
_ color picker or other things written by folks
_   add all .jar files in lib/plugins on startup
_ make some kind of internal color picker
_   could be a separate window that's always around if needed
_ external editor -> add a command to launch
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1043734580;start=0
_ add tool to hit 'next' to go through examples
_   just make it "next file in folder" since examples are all over
_   also need to copy examples locally
_ add tool for running in jview
_   only available after export (or when an applet dir exists)
_   warn user that applet html will be over-written
_ add tool to "Add custom html to sketch"
_   that copies applet.html, 
_   opens sketch folder, 
_   and gives info about what to do next (how to edit)


export stuff
_ write export-to-application
_   lock feature for present mode (part of export to application?)
_   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
_   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
_   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
_   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works
_   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
_   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
_     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
_   also make sure pack() is happening
_   add manifest.mf to exported applets so that applications will work
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1045983103;start=0
_   BApplet.main(new String[] { "flashcards3" });
_     this will need to detect whether the user has their own main()
_     or even BApplet.main(new String[] { getClass().getName() });
_     META-INF/MANIFEST.MF contains just "Main-Class: ClassName"
_     main sticking point will be serial/qtjava in exports
_ include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_   or rename the old applet folder to something else? (nah, too messy)
_ make multiple jar files thing work as an option
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1067360903;start=0
_   applet default is one file, application default is multiple
_   user in advanced mode can switch to the other
_   buttons on side of sketch do default (last) behavior
_ need to decide how to handle "stop" button in present mode
_   when running externally, people need to write their own stop function
_   just get export to application working so this can be supported
_   for now, they're stuck w/ running in the env and getting the ugliness

PDE / Find & Replace

   1 _ only enable "find next" in menu after a find has happened


PDE / Editor Header

   1 _ make some fancy extendo things because the tabs get too big
   1 _   either condense or popdown menu thingy
   1 _ save caret position when switching tabs
   1 _ ctrl-tab to switch between tabs
   1 _ maintain tab scroll and caret positions


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

   1 _ transparently convert spaces to underscores (?)
   1 _   underscoring everything is kinda nasty
   1 _ if a .pde isn't contained in a properly named folder
   1 _   offer to rename the parent folder, rather than placing in a new folder
   1 _ may need a progress bar for "save as"
   1 _   or just the file copy function in general
   1 _   since it may take a long time (i.e. 1000s of screen grabs)
   1 _ "save as" shouldn't show save as dialog for sketches 
   1 _   unless that's the current mode that's being used

   1 _   not sure why this would be the case


PDE / Compiler

BUGS / Preprocessor

   1 _ casting problems in the parser
   1 _   float u = float(x)/width; works.
   1 _   float u = (float(x)/width); doesn't work: "unexpected token: float".
   1 _   float u = (x/float(width)); works! 
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1084011098;start=0
   1 _ if last line of code is a comment with no CR after it,
   1 _   an OutOfMemoryError wants to happen, 
   1 _   but right now there's a hack to add a CR in PdePreprocessor
   1 _ return (int(5.5)) causes an error
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083624993;start=0
   1 _ random, single slash in the code doesn't throw an error
   1 _   (just gets removed by the preprocessor)
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1099371066;start=0
   1 _ allow doubles in preproc
   1 _   (for casting, etc) particularly for Math.cos() et al


PDE / Create Font

   1 _ close/hide window on 'ESC'
   1 _ loading is very slow on the first time (getting all font names)
   1 _   show a progress/status bar while it's happening?
   1 _   (would be useful to at least tell user that system not locked up)
   1 _ font builder chopping off parts of letters
   1 _   this may be fixed?
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1076358432;start=0
   1 _ font encoding issues 
   1 _   java seems to force straight windows encoding.. (problem for pi fonts)
   1 _   opentype/cff fonts don't work with live loading from the app
   1 _   many (all?) opentype fonts won't show up or aren't supported
   1 _     this may be only cff fonts that have trouble
   1 _   when encoding with something besides the standard encoding, problematic
   1 _     so sonata otf and sonata don't seem to have any chars at all
   1 _ available font issues
   1 _   is getFontList returning a different set of fonts from device2d?
   1 _     try it out on java 1.3 versus 1.4
   1 _   getAllFonts() not quite working for many fonts
   1 _   i.e. Orator Std on windows.. macosx seems to be ok
   1 _   is getFamilyNames() any different/better?
   1 _   when did this break? 1.4.1? 1.4.x vs 1.3?
   1 _   may be that cff fonts won't work?
   1 _   or is it only those with ps names?
   1 _ create font with user-specified charsets


PDE / Editor Status

   1 _ error messages run off the edge and go invisible
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1074894329
   1 _ multi-line errors a mess in jikes
   1 _   maybe a dropdown list thing, with the first just shown?
   1 _ move to modal dialog showError/Message/Warning/Prompt design 
   1 _   nicely design dialog boxes to go with visual of p5
   1 _   maybe something that shows stack trace?
   1 _   with an 'email this' button? (include source code too?)
   1 _   also need a "prompt" dialog for asking filenames, etc
   1 _   implement and remove PdeEditorStatus stuff

DISTRIBUTION / Mac OS X

   1 _ fix find/replace focus issue on osx
   1 _   give that field focus explicitly, rather than just for typing

   1 _   setBackground(Color) didn't seem to help inside PdeBase.<init>
   1 _ use disk:// notation as panther alternative
