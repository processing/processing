libraries
_ add control for dependencies (i.e. svg needs xml), needed for export
_ add "pretty menu name" to the export.txt file
_ more export.txt to xml? (nah, it's only flat information)
_ need better platform designation setup for libs
_ library installation should use the sketchbook folder, not the p5 folder

_ PApplet.this doesn't work (does it work in javac?)
_   sketchname.this also doesn't work, because Temporary_NNNN used for name
_   but since it's another tab/class, will run externally
_   so should make the external version use the actual sketch name not temp

_ make more fixes to the key bindings
_   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnacc/html/atg_keyboardshortcuts.asp
_   http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGUserInput/chapter_11_section_3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000361-TPXREF61

_ temporarily added log4j and jalopy (for the autoformatter)
_   need to decide where these go, or if they're included at all

_ after sketch -> add file, no confirmation message is shown
_ applet sizing issues with external vm
_   could this possibly be related to the linux bug?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=430

Must have for 1.0:
> a,c) P2D to return, P2D to simply return in its previous form
> f) Java 1.5 support (jikes won't let you use Java 1.5 constructs)
> h) fix auto-format

For 2.0
> b) P2D to be accurate like JAVA2D
> e) Java 1.1 support (we're now limited to 1.3)
> g) support for running with user accounts that have umlauts/accents/etc
> d) strokeWeight() for 3D objects, even if it's ugly 


LIBRARIES / svg
_ when using get(), reset the bounds for the objects
_   otherwise it's always relative to the original document
_ save/restore more of the p5 graphics drawing state
_   not setting colorMode(), strokeCap, etc.
_ support for text (shouldn't be too bad, use createFont)
_   implement text spans for svg output
_ get entity tags working in xml library
_ try enabling blending modes
_ add better support for attributes buried in styles (support ai9/10/11)
_ test what happens when transparency is used with gradient fill
_ look into transformation issues... guessing this is probably wrong
_   this may be what's throwing off the radial radius transform
_ implement A and a (arcs)
_ check for any other pieces of missing path api
_   multiple sets of coordinates after a command not supported
_   i.e. M with several coords means moveto followed by many linetos
_   also curveto with multiple sets of points is ignored
_ document somehow.. svg viewer will be discontinued
_   http://www.adobe.com/svg/eol.html


LIBRARIES / xml
_ need to handle how save() works inside xml lib
_ need to handle <!ENTITY tags for svg documents
_ vectors shouldn't be exposed, need to expose attr lists as arrays
_   or also add a method for getting the vectors?

_ when running externally, set window frame title to the sketch name
_   is this only a problem on macosx? 

_ when drawing large video, the two triangles for the rect are out of sync
_   only shows up in P3D


_ slow save/new because of large sketchbook
_   this is a total cluster, the rebuild is being called incessantly
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1162801212
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1141126582

processing wish list 
_ opening multiple versions of p5 at a time
_   shouldn't actually be a big deal 
_   would also help the opening multiple files thing
_ TRIANGLE_STRIP not highlighted for "find in reference"
_   nor is it listed on the reference page
_   so students can't find the ref for it
_   needs to link TRIANGLE_STRIP to the beginShape() reference
_ stop button not stopping anything
_ copy running from from /tmp/buildXXxxx on crash of p5
_   should probably make a way to save/recover code
_ code as columns (screen is wide, code is not)

_ lots of runtime exceptions still being lost on osx
_   particularly with multi-threaded applications
_ macosx dropping exceptions all the time.. grr
_   solution is to export, and then see how it runs
_   this is particularly bad with threaded applications

Exception in thread "Thread-2" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
processing/core/PApplet
    at processing.serial.Serial.<init>(Serial.java:156) 
generally, that error means that something is missing from the
CLASSPATH. the NoClassDefError gives erroneous feedback about *what*
class is actually missing, as of java 1.3+ (yay!)
so perhaps conflicting versions of a library in the sketchbook (solve
this by setting to an empty sketchbook temporarily) or files might be
installed in the CLASSPATH variable or something conflicting in
/System/Library/Extensions. 

_ add server/client notification thing for the nyu guys

DOC / Text

_ how to use textMode(SHAPE) with opengl
_   things will be extremely slow (fix later)
_   things will also be very ugly on-screen
_ text being nicer in java2d
_   use createFont() to load the font or use a font from your machine
_   note that createFont() is no good for applets/export to web
_ textMode(SCREEN) for P2D and P3D for nice fast text in screen space
_   currently slow in JAVA2D and OPENGL, but this will improve
_ what is the vlw font file format?
_ createFont() needs to run 1.3+, and not in applets
_   where is the bug reference for this.. and can it be fixed?
_ shapes from 3D type
_   the way to do it (will improve later) is to use some undocumented features  
_   1) you have to use the OPENGL renderer 
_   2) use textMode(SHAPE); 
_   3) use createFont() (which you already are) 
_   this will convert all the shape data from the fonts for writing. 
_   it will be *extremely* slow, which is part of why it's not documented yet. 
_   but it will work with beginRaw().


DOC / Integration

_ move stuff about getting gl object and java2d stuff here
_ how do i add gui to a sketch?
_   don't use awt components

DOC / Discourse Board

_ someone wrote up an initial version of this
_ how to put [code] around blocks of code
_   also mention contributed plugin for formatting
_   also the reference page on the bb commands
_ i don't answer to instant messages
_ i don't answer email

_ non-processing posts will be deleted (not a java discussion board)
_ no duplicate posts - find an area and post to
_ explanation of what the areas are
_ be sure to look at the reference, especially the extended reference
_   questions like 'how do i do x' are often solved by looking at the api

PDE - Processing Development Environment


PDE / Base

_ properly handle non-ascii chars in p5 folder name
_   use javac? 
_     the eclipse jdt compiler may be even better
X   ask japanese students about whether jikes is working ok
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49
_   or at least warn the user to install somehwere else
_   perhaps the get around this by building into sketch folder
_     when non-ascii chars in use, just launch everything externally
_   also fails with export-to-application
_     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=252

_ make export put a timestamp in the html code (hidden or visible)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=66
_ exporting application copies .java files 
_   .java files are copied to the root folder as well as the source folder


PDE / Find & Replace

_ find/replace - replace should do auto find next(?)
_   or have a replace & find button
_ all around very ugly, fix it up
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=67
_ several tweaks
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=68
_   only enable "find next" in menu after a find has happened
_   placing "replace" next to "find" ... (hitting "replace all" by accident) 
_   have a button "replace & find next"
_ allowing to find & replace over multiple tabs 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=69


PDE / History

_ implement new version of history
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71
_   make history folder, and a zip (not gz) file for each entry
_   history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_     could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_     along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_     no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_     checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_     history converter option?
_   only first 20 entries visible?
_   shortcut to walk through history, ala photoshop (ctrl-alt-z)
_   zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)
_   make hooks to history api so others can write tools around it


PDE / Preferences

_ prefs window not visible on windows taskbar
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=438
_ saved window positions.. if displays has changed, becomes a problem
_   record the display that it was on?
_     GraphicsDevice gd = frame.getGraphicsConfiguration().getDevice();
_   make sure that the application is within the bounds of the current display?
_   (from 0, 0 to width, height)
_   messy since some displays have negative coords
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=72
_ split Preferences and PreferencesFrame?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74
_ preferences window has been hit with the ugly stick
_   redo panel to use proper Box layout etc
_   also needs to look good across all platforms
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=73
_ make available the background colors for present mode, stop button color
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=75
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1130781367;start=2#2
_ add ability to set the display where present mode makes things start


PDE / Runner 

_ need to deal with classpath conflicts
_   avoid garbage that people have installed on their machines
_   antlr.jar in the classpath will cause trouble.. 
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1138652326
_   jogl jar files, or jogl install will cause trouble
_     /System/Library/Extensions or /Library/Extensions
_ when a conflicting library is found, need to report it
_   altho prolly only when it's actually different (md5hash it?)
_   this seems to be causing a lot of trouble with recent releases
_   (opengl changes and whatnot)
_ jar files like the bad aiexport plugin will cause serious problems
_   need to ignore processing.core classes showing up in other jar files
_   tougher than it looks, because it all depends on what java wants to use
_     i.e. even if not specified, the stuff will be in the classpath
_   need to make classpath code be less promiscuous
_   the order of adding libraries to classpath should be opposite
_     the important local libraries should be first in cp, user contrib later
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=321
_ make the p5 icon show up for the window (and in the dock) 
_   when launching a new sketch
_ does closing the window call stop()?
_   need to make sure hitting stop button and closing window explicitly call
_ stop() not working very well 
_   as a result, dispose() methods aren't being called on libraries
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77
_ NullPointerException inside setup() comes up weird
_   because NullPointerException is a RuntimeException
_   maybe the renderer exception is something different? newrendex?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=78
_ exception in setup() on external app doesn't kill run button 
_   also doesn't kill external vm
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=79
_ quitting from present mode doesn't kill run button
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80
_ exceptions in draw() apps aren't caught
_   the program resize(200, 200); just does nothing (doesn't complain)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=81
_ weird exception in the run button watcher
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=42


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ show progress dialog during export and save
_ only rebuild sketchbook on "save as" or "rename" of sketch
_   currently it's rebuilding whenever "save" called too
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=357
_   even more of a problem becase set modified set true all the time
_ don't reload sketch on "save as"
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433
_ in rebuild sketch menu - disable subfolders working as libraries
_   if a sketch, don't allow subfolders
o   or maybe just that libraries must be in the root? 
o   nah, cuz that would mean can't make subfolder called "libraries"
_ write prefs when opening/saving/etc a file
_   when p5 crashes, want to re-open file easily
_ is the 'hide' option for code dumb? i've never used it
_   should it just hide the code, not actually remove it?
_ do we finish the tabs thing for 1.0? yes
_   could probably be done in a reasonable simple way.. ala eclipse
_   show additional tabs in the dropdown list? show all?
_ robert's tunnel example, why does tunnel not show up as leftmost tab?
_ hitting ESC on "create this, move file, continue" opened anyway
_ may need a progress bar for "save as"
_   or just the file copy function in general
_   since it may take a long time (i.e. 1000s of screen grabs)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=82
_ "save as" shouldn't always show save as dialog
_   unless that's the current mode that's being used
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=83
_ handle renaming with case changes (currently ignores case change)
_   see notes/bitching in Sketch.nameCode()
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=85
_ setting sketchbook to a folder on a network mounted drive
_   does this work? test on both on mac and pc.. 
_   or if not, should recommend people against it 
_   (i.e. folders disappearing if net has trouble)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=87
_ some type of sketch archive format for posting examples (.psk?)
_   would be nice to open a sketch directly from a zip file
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=88
_   maybe just open from a zip file, since psk doesn't help anything

TOOLS / General

_ make the export to the board just copy to clipboard
_   also make it insert &nbsp; for extra spaces
_ need to write converter that will handle syntax changes
_   basically find & replace with regexps
_   framerate() -> frameRate()
_ convert from alpha to 1.0 syntax
_   acts just like find/replace.. go through and do by hand
_   3 column input file
_   regexp to find, to replace, human readable description
_   (void\s+)loop(\s+{) -> $1draw$2 (maintain all whitespace stuff)
_   "The loop() method is now called draw() as of beta"
_   "angleMode no longer exists, use radians() around your angles" 
_   (comment out the line)
_ tools -> shared code
_   Integrator / FloatThing / CameraStuff -- Update
_   to pull code from a local folder
_   update will update classes from shared in the current folder
_ tools api
_   need to support the basic set of functions that are expected 
_   to be used, otherwise it's gonna be total hell when we make a real api
_   getEditor()
_   get/setSelStart/End
_   get/setSelText
_   get/setText
_   setCurrentTab(int index or String filename)
_   getTabs() ? maybe these are interface to the code class
_ need method for showing prefs for the tools
_   add pref to handle date vs. increment on archive sketch
_ make dynamically loaded plugins and "tools" menu
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=124
_   break out beautify as its own plugin
_   tools api:
_     init() -> run when p5 is first launched
_     isAvailable() -> true/false whether the option should be dimmed
_       skip this for now, not sending events to tools all the time
_     show() -> open the window or run the tool
_       is there a better name than show() since not all will be visible?
_       maybe it's just a run() method launched via invokeLater()?
_     hide() -> hide the tool's frame
_     getDefaultShortcut() -> returns the default shortcut this tools wants
_       store this in the data file instead
_     needs to be able to get current sketch code
_     look at the pretty-formatting code to see what else needs to be in api
o     getMenu() -> return non-null the tool is a submenu
o       no, bad idea.. don't want a zillion submenus on things
_ need a proper means to handle command keys for tools
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=140
_ external editor -> add a command to launch
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=141
_ add tool for running in jview
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=142
_   calls export, or only available after export (or when an applet dir exists)
_   warn user that applet html will be over-written
_ add tool to "Add custom html to sketch"
_   that copies applet.html, 
_   opens sketch folder, 
_   and gives info about what to do next (how to edit)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=143
_ tool to run in appletviewer? sun.applet.Main is appletviewer
_ small gray gap shows up in color picker
_   getMaximumSize() not being respected on Windows (Linux?)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=310
_ import sketch from url (takes a zip from archive sketch)
_ ftp upload sketch
_ archive sketch direct to bug report


TOOLS / Courseware

_ export sketch as applet when uploading
_ save sketch zip files, have a means to load them from "teacher" version of p5
_ figure out how to use the 


TOOLS / libraries

_ could have library developers update compatability note
_   so they would need to test library and say "compatible with 0110"
_   before it would automatically update or show as an update
_ tools -> get library
_   library url: [ http://blahblah.org/something ]
_   this would grab something.version, and something.zip
_   maybe something.xml that would include a bunch of background
_ tools -> update libraries
_   this would check the something.version to see if it's newer
_ document how to add libraries: put in sketchbook (not libraries folder)
_ library/download.url and library/home.url
_ if there's a reference subfolder, add that to the help menu
_   and enable it for "find in reference"


TOOLS / Auto Format

_ do a better job of maintaining cursor during beautify 
_ only auto format a particular section of code
_   set the 'tabs' var based on how many spaces on previous line
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217
_ removes code with extra parens or braces
_   (an extra } brace deleting everything after it)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=109
_ progressively eats code w/ certain brace settings
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=235
_ Auto Format hangs when a non-terminated ' is included
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=236
_ hex colors don't get formatted
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=303
_ another code example that crashes
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=363
_ japanese characters in comments cause trouble with auto-format
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1153505384


TOOLS / Create Font

_ loading is very slow on the first time (getting all font names)
_   create the tool object on startup, then use thread to getAllFonts()
_   show a progress/status bar while it's happening?
_   (would be useful to at least tell user that system not locked up)
_ create font with user-specified charsets
_   may help solve: http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=98
_ when resizing window, only resize the text display area
_   just a matter of moving around the panels and BorderLayout
_ remember previous font selection when returning to the window

LIBRARIES / General

_ need to unpack InvocationTargetException in xxxxxxEvent calls
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=VideoCamera;action=display;num=1116850328#3
_ unregisterXxxx() calls to remove methods from libs
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=312


LIBRARIES / Video

_ documented in faq, add something to the lib "camera not installed"
_   quicktime.std.stdQTException(QTjava:6.1.3gl),-9405=couldntgetrequiredcomponent,qtversion:7108000 at quicktime.std.stdQTExceptionchekcerror
_ need to add resize method to capture object
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1150227643
_ figure out what's up with the qt error handler
_   is this what's preventing the errors from being caught properly?
_   shutting these off for 0116 so hopefully the messages improve
_ need to prevent multiple QTSession open or close
_   static method shared across the lib, or some such
_ reading movie is really really slow (2-3 fps)
_   possible improvement from qtjava list added
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=40
_ Movie needs the crop() functions ala Capture
_ tearing and incomplete updates on capture?
_   putting read() inside draw() seems to eliminate this?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=114
_ pause and framerate aren't working
_   framerate does set the frequency which movieEvent will be called, 
_   but it is not setting the "available" field corrrectly. 
_   sketch .zip file in casey's email message
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=370
_ wrong device name for video capture will cause a crash
_ when passing in 'null' as the capture, dialog pops up fine
_   but the applet craps out after a few seconds (pinwheel spin)
_ couldn't get req'd component also happens when the capture isn't ready
_   may also mean that no camera is plugged in
_   also, don't mention winvdig on the mac
_ if user cancels prompt, throws a '-128,userCanceledErr'
_   in which case, need to return null (or ""?) for the prompt
_   which will also just give you the last camera
_   should it be new Camera(PROMPT);
_ audio stops working after two seconds
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=277
_ include a separate video class to handle just playback
_   video playback can be much faster if not messing with pixels
_   could instead use texsubimage in opengl, etc
_   only supports tint() (to set alpha or color) and drawing? just drawing?


LIBRARIES / Net

_ add an event to Server that notifies when a Client disconnects
_ move the useful serial buffering fxns into net library
_ make the Client list public
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1116056805


LIBRARIES / Serial

_ port buffering not working properly
_   may just be a problem with thread starvation
_   bufferUntil() fires an event but continues to fill up the buffer
_   bug report includes patch from mellis
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=96
_ add prompt() method to Serial (simple dialog box that pops up)
