GRAPHICS LIBRARY

A hybrid of OpenGL (3D Graphics) and some aspects of Postscript (Fill, Stroke)
The graphics library is called Bagel, which is an internal name.


BAGEL / Graphics API Additions

ap b _ hiding the cursor. noCursor(), cursor()/cursor(ARROW), cursor(HAND), cursor(CROSS), cursor(image_file)

ks b _ images and pixel copying (api for this?)
ks b _   copyPixel(x, y, to_x, to_y)
ks b _   copyArea(x, y, w, h, to_x, to_y)
ks b _   copyImage(x, y, w, h,  to_x, to_y)
ks b _   resize of bimage, make a copy of image?
ks b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1050328581
ks b _ getPixel() and other fxns for BImage

bf b _ light(x, y, z, c1, c2, c3, TYPE)
bf b _   also BLight with same constructor, and on() and off() fxn

   b _ should image(img, x, y, alpha) work instead of using fill?
   b _   or maybe another word for fill/stroke.. apply? colorize?
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1050323800


BAGEL / Rendering

   b _ shape.. non-homogenous colors for beginShape()
   b _   currently disabled b/c homogenousColors not set false for vertices
   b _   and code not written for curve vertices

   b _ picking
   b _   what is the API for picking?
   b _   ability to write data other than image into the buffer
   b _   user can introduce new kinds of buffers at will (!)
   b _   lists of names of objects, or the 'line number' buffer
   b _   but how to determine *where* on object the hit occurs

ca b _ lines
ca b X   rewrite line and stroke code, it's a buggy mess
ca b X     lines become 2 pixels thick after a 3D transform 
ca b X     better handling of single-pixel special case
ca b _       flat_line_retribution is a hack, can go away
ca b _   setting stroke width on circle makes odd patterns
ca b X     line endcaps and line joins. strokeMode()
ca b _       lower priority, but at least leave room
ca b ?   make sure line() commands don't try to have a fill
ca b _   box is not opaque
ca b X     problem is that lines are drawn second
ca b X     one pixel lines have no z value.. argh
ca b X     bug re: 3d depth sorting on lines
ca b _     http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1043894019;start=0
ca b _     http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1042004618
ca b _     translate(58, 48, 0); 
ca b _     rotateY(0.5);
ca b _     box(40);

ca b X concave/complex polygon
ca b _   eventually POLYGON auto-detects convex/concave polygon
ca b _   also add POLYGON_CONVEX and POLYGON_CONCAVE
ca b X clipping objects (clipping planes?)
ca b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1058491568;start=0
ca b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1052313604;start=0
ca b X   things are flying into the camera and halting apps
ca b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1042699742
ca b X   NullPointerException apparently when things way offscreen
ca b _     i.e. glyphrot with scale set to 4
ca b _     or at least that things get ridiculously slow
ca b _     clipping issues here.. but also something in scan converter
ca b X     not clipping areas from offscreen
ca b _       huge geometry slows things way down

ca b _ get font things sewn up 
ca b X  create a simple generator for grayscale bdf fonts
ca b _     document the change and make several of them
ca b _   font smoothing (unless hint SMOOTH_IMAGES enabled) is broken

   b _ font support is overkill and sucks
   b _   need fast 2D text that's not affected by the transforms
   b _   also needs to look good, not squished from texture weirdness
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1051806272

ks b _ circles and spheres
ks b _   bresenham (flat) oval function
ks b _   finish fill mode of flat circle function
ks b _   stroked version of sphere is just a circle (?)
ks b _   setting accuracy of circles/sphere

bf b _ illustrator export / rendering mode
bf b _   also postscript or pdf export?
bf b _   version of Illustrator.java that uses bagel api
bf b _   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
bf b _   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
bf b _     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
bf b _   version of ProcessingApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.


BAGEL / Data API

bf b _ split to take strings (ie. for ", ")
bf b _ quicksort should probably just be made into 'sort' class
bf b _   it's the only one ever used
bf b _   can this be done using an inner class?
bf b _ read table/csv formatted data into a matrix
bf b _   pseudo-database format version of this that stores indexes to file
bf b _     rather than loading the whole thing at once
bf b _ more advanced splitting of files into rows/cols uses another class
bf b _   other class also has concept for random access of lines
bf b _   by storing the line positions, can access without loading all
bf b _   into memory because some files will be too large
bf b _ need some model for i/o that makes more sense
bf b _   getting whole words from serial, network, and files
bf b _   or buffers of specific length with a sync byte


BAGEL / Serial

   b _ basic usb support?
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1053684925


BAGEL / Details

bf b _ make zbuffer available instead of g.zbuffer
   b _ getting mouse movement outside the window
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1051916278;start=0
   b _ gaps in lines for pmouseX, mouseX
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1044438078;start=0
   b _ too many push() will silently stop the applet inside a loop
   b _   test winding polygons in different directions
   b _   test lighting to see how it compares with gl
   b _   better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
   b _   is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
   b _     may be correct, it worked for nik
   b _ draw mode issues.. size and background must be int/float constants
   b _   might be a better 'mode' for bagel so bkg and size cmds work
   b _   rather than app being enclosed in beginFrame/endFrame loop
   b _ images drawn from center don't work for simage()
   b _   currently calling slower image routine
bf b _ p5 classes into packages (bagel especially)
bf b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1052908285;start=0
   b _ inside draw() mode, delay() does nothing
   b _   delay might be a good way to signal drawing to the screen/updating


BAGEL / Future

   2 _ alter strokeWidth in LINE_STRIP
   2 _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1053795842;start=0
   2 _ keypressed is not persistent
   2 _   key repeat in os vs. how java handles it
   2 _   search java faq for info about getting around it
   2 _ drawMode() for MULTIPLY and ADD
   2 _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1051208333
   2 _ nicer/simpler api for moving the camera around
   2 _ better api for fonts
   2 _ fixed fonts are screwed, should only work at screen resolution
   2 _   getStream for the filename doesn't work for directories
   2 _     getfont("fonts/blah.fbf") refers to blah.raw, but that
   2 _     also needs to be searched for in the fonts/ dir..
   2 _ try with 1.4 frame buffer stuff to see if it's faster
   2 _ write shearing function
   2 _ optimize rotation functions
   2 _ update/noUpdate() could also be done to force explicit updates only
   2 _   for ui-type applications that don't need to continually redraw
   2 _   instead use void update() as a function like loop and draw
   2 _   third mode for interactive apps that have to be queried
   2 _   shouldn't do so much work (redrawing in loop) if waiting for input
   2 _     mode for when no full animation taking place
   2 _     otherwise machine is continually maxed out while app is running
   2 _ way to screen grab at higher resolution
   2 _   method for rendering at higher res and then scaling down
   2 _   (even if this causes signficant performance hit)
   2 _ look at GLUT for other needed shapes
   2 _ export to static flash-based graphics
   2 _ build in second matrix type: 2d affine
   2 _ write code for reading uncompressed b/w tiff images
   2 _   incorporate for fixed width fonts
   2 _ fast(er?) version of bagel that just uses java graphics
   2 _   but leaves out many features
   2 _ setting a fill color when drawing an image should affect the image
   2 _   or maybe image.setColor or setTone to mix a specific color in

PDE - Processing Development Environment



PDE / General 

   b _ be able to draw something inside setup (?)
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1044689650;start=0


PDE / Pre-preprocessor 
Currently using Oro for search and replace preprocessor.
Future plans to use Javacup for preprocessor and Jikes for compiler.

bf b _ separate compiler from other kjc-specific code
bf b _   change writeJava/start functions to be combined in kjc
bf b _   but the rest inside PdeEditor that takes care of launching/placing


   b _ bug in comments 
sometimes (never when creating a new sketch, only when an old one has been loaded), if I try to add a comment to identify the end of a method class, ie like 

void Sample () 
{ 
  <basic code here> 
} // end of Sample handler 
 
P5 return me an unexpected 'handler' token error! 
And when I change this comment to  
} /* end of Sample handler */ 
everything comes back to normal?! 
 
This don't happen everytimes.. but once it started, the error stay there!

PDE / Runtime (includes classloading)

dh b _ environment locks up when error stream isn't for the class
dh b _   this happens when it's another thread (i.e. image fetcher)

dh b _   only allow under win/osx/linux
dh b _   not clear how to kill the process.. does that work w/ 1.3?
dh b _ support 'classes' folder, through the use of a classloader
dh b _   could also be done by launching external java app
dh b _   all .jar files etc are added from this folder automatically
dh b _   'public class' thing to make things available to all sketches

dh b _   but makes no error.. peditorconsole probably swallowing it
dh b _ ability to include other code from sketchbook directory
dh b _   compile entire sketchbook on startup, check for new files on compile?
dh b _ present mode, click background window and front window hides
dh b _   wasn't present in jdk 1.3, focus manager changed in 1.4

dh b _   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
dh b _   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
dh b _   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
dh b _   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works

dh b _   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
dh b _     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
dh b _   also make sure pack() is happening
