_ jar files like the bad aiexport plugin will cause serious problems
_   need to ignore processing.core classes showing up in other jar files
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=321

_ stop button won't kill a video sketch (bug 150 example does this) 

_ add "hide stop button" arg for PApplet

_ set "no smileys" as the default for posting code
_ make the export to the board just copy to clipboard
_   also make it insert &nbsp; for extra spaces

_ linux problems with things not showing up
_   probably threading issue, 98 doesn't have any trouble
_   signs point to Runner or PApplet changes between 98 and 99
_   commenting out applet.setupFrameResizeListener() 
_     in line 307 from Runner.java solved the problem
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=282

_ svg loader is on the list for 1.0
_   maybe include as part of PApplet (casey thinks so)
_ svg output, make simple version of PGraphicsSVG based on PGraphicsPDF

_ sketch marked as modified too aggressively

_ antlr.jar in the classpath will cause trouble.. 
_ jogl jar files, or jogl install will cause trouble
_   /System/Library/Extensions or /Library/Extensions
_ when a conflicting library is found, need to report it
_   altho prolly only when it's actually different (md5hash it?)
_   this seems to be causing a lot of trouble with recent releases
_   (opengl changes and whatnot)

_ issue of people calling their sketches things like Server
_ warn if someone extends PApplet but mis-names the sketch
_   or don't allow it to be exported
_   or at least add a note about this to the faq
_ show an error message when on export to app
_   when no main() is included but class extends PApplet

_ keep checking whether google has started to honor robots.txt
_   http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=angleMode+site%3Aprocessing.org&btnG=Search

_ add "recent files" list to open menu?

_ unchecking 'use external editor' sketch should not set modified
_   dangerous if a version that hasn't been re-loaded has possibility
_   to overwrite. i.e. make a change and save in external editor,
_   don't actually 

_ we're breaking some mac human interface guidelines
_   should be using a menu factory to create menubar for all sub-windows
_   http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2042.html
_   and the general warning dialogs are just ass ugly
_   (i.e. we really need those replacements for JOptionPane)

_ properly handle non-ascii chars in p5 folder name
_   use javac?
X   ask japanese students about whether jikes is working ok
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49
_   or at least warn the user to install somehwere else
_   perhaps the get around this by building into sketch folder
_     when non-ascii chars in use, just launch everything externally
_   also fails with export-to-application
_     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=252
_ finish putting all the bugs into bugzilla
_   add a notation to the bugs site re: reading the faq and searching first
X   move p5 site bug reporting to bugzilla
_   do the same for suggestions
_     and detail the suggestions policy on the dev site: diy
_   post a page explaining the bug reporting system

last minute regression from 0097
_ exported movies seem to have trouble (windows only?)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=231

bugzilla 
_ need to change what people can edit in the bug report
_   do something about the bug summary field to not make it editable

_   also mention contributed plugin for formatting
_   also the reference page on the bb commands
_ i don't answer to instant messages
_ i don't answer email
_ use the bugs db instead of the bugs board
_ read the faq, read the faq
_ read the reference.. right-click on a word and choose "find in ref"
_ non-processing posts will be deleted (not a java discussion board)
_ no duplicate posts - find an area and post to
_ explanation of what the areas are
_ be sure to look at the reference, especially the extended reference
_   questions like 'how do i do x' are often solved by looking at the api
_   for instance, to get the framerate, use framerate()

_ under the hood - complex 
_   how to get started with coding
_   everything subclasses PApplet
_   if you need a particular name, add it with "extends PApplet"
_   all code from tabs is joined to one sketch
_   if you want it separate, then you have to make .java files
_     in doing so, you'll lose access to 'g'
_   add main() to your app to make it run on its own
_   preproc stuff.. have to make setup() into public void setup()

PDE - Processing Development Environment


PDE / Base

_ command line support
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=219
_   would still require awt, but would take a sketch on cmd line
_   build it and then exit
_   also an option to launch p5, load a sketch and run it
_ settings.path.fallback not being used
_   need to check the mkdirs() to make sure it's not going too deep
_   really important for intl versions that are having trouble
_   or ask for the sketch folder name.. why isn't it?
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1
_ option to suppress warning dialogs
_   starting with the one about modifying the sketch name for spaces
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3


PDE / Compiler & Preprocessor

_ using a processing keyword as a variable name gives unhelpful error message
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=213
_ web colors < 6 chars produce bizarre error:
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=196
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=228
_ synchronized (something) { } is horking up the preproc
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=136
_ casting problems in the parser
_   straighten out int() -> toInt() conversions
_   float u = float(x)/width; works.
_   float u = (float(x)/width); doesn't work: "unexpected token: float".
_   float u = (x/float(width)); works! 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=4
_   return (int(5.5)) causes an error
_ random, single slash in the code doesn't throw an error
_   (just gets removed by the preprocessor)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=6
_ allow doubles in preproc
_   (for casting, etc) particularly for Math.cos() et al
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=7
_ jikes bugs mean some code just won't compile:
_   include javac? would this be a good solution for linux?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8
_ don't allow goofy case versions of reserved words
_   keypressed should maybe throw an error
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=9
_ an empty .java tab will throw an error
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=10
_ warn about writing non-1.1 code. 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=11
_ missing semicolons - better error message
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=12
_ missing brackets, unmatched brackets
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=13
_ "unexpected token void" -> "You're mixing dynamic and static mode"
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=14
_ expecting RPAREN messages are ugly
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=15
_ not enough args for triangle (or args in general) 
_   throws out bizarre message 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17
_ if 'void' left out before loop or setup, cryptic message about
_   'constructor loop must be named Temporary_23498_2343'
_   add a better handler for this specific thing?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18
_ using a keyword as a variable name gives unhelpful error message
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=212

hacked for fix, needs real fix
_ NullPointerException on unterminated comment at end of code
_   and OutOfMemoryError and weird lockup
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16
_ preprocessor error if last line of code is a comment with no CR after it,
_   an OutOfMemoryError wants to happen, 
_   but right now there's a hack to add a CR in PdePreprocessor
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5


PDE / Editor

_ when running with external editor, hide the editor text area
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20
_ horizontal scroller gets weird sometimes
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23
_ mouse wheel broken in the text editor? (windows jdk 1.5?) 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24
_ lock the minimum size for the main processing editor frame
_   if it's made too small, stuff from the bottom disappears
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25
_ add mnemonics for menus (alt-f to open 'file')
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26
_ implement page setup and print
_   pretty printing of code in project
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=27
_ option to just print all code in project
_   option to export all the code as colored html
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=28
_ p5 becomes a memory hog (benelek and glen murphy)
_   not confirmed for a long time
_   even without sketches open, perhaps not gc'ing properly
_   objects probably not getting finalized
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=29
_ menu weirdness (benelek)
_   when you've got a menu open, move a cursor over the text area
_   and back over the menu, the text-area cursor type remains. 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=30
_ rename/saveas doesn't properly have its focus set
_   under windows, immediately typing after rename doesn't select
_   the whole thing is selected, but not directly editable
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=31
_ figure out how to cancel 'save changes' on macosx and windows
_   macosx handleQuit seems to force termination (at least on 1.3)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=32
_ dim edit menus as appropriate during selection/no selection/etc
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=33
_ Ctrl-Z will undo, but not scroll to where the undo happens. 
_   so user thinks nothing is happening and overundo. 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35
_ undo has become sluggish
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36
_ undo after "import library" makes a blank screen
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=41
_ fonts smaller than 10 cause problems in the editor on osx
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=51
_ code coloring is imperfect because it's not based on a parser
_   i.e. mousePressed() is red but mouseMoved() is brown
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=113


PDE / Editor Buttons

_ when holding down shift, show the alternate behavior for EditorHeader
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37
_ run button not properly unhighlighting
_   does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
_   also when using draw() instead of loop()
_     applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38
_ if export fails (compile error) need to un-highlight the export button
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=39


PDE / Editor Header

_ make some fancy extendo things because the tabs get too big
_   either condense or popdown menu thingy
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=54
_ ctrl-tab to switch between tabs
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=55
_ not always updating on rename (maybe a mac problem?)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=56


PDE / Editor Status

_ error messages run off the edge and go invisible
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=57
_ multiple errors a mess in jikes
_   actual error may be 4th of 5
_   maybe a dropdown list thing, with the first just shown?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=58
_ move all prompts to modal dialog showError/Message/Warning/Prompt
_   nicely design dialog boxes to go with visual of p5
_   maybe something that shows stack trace?
_   with an 'email this' button? (include source code too?)
_   also need a "prompt" dialog for asking filenames, etc
_   implement and remove PdeEditorStatus stuff
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=59


PDE / Export

_ errors during export don't show up properly (no red status bar)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=194
_ include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_   or rename the old applet folder to something else? (too messy)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=61
_ need to decide how to handle "stop" button in present mode
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=63
_   when running externally, people need to write their own stop function
_   just get export to application working so this can be supported
_   for now, they're stuck w/ running in the env and getting the ugliness
_ if size() not found in export/compile, ask the user
_   have size(myWidth, myHeight) set a static var in PGraphics
_   for the last size that was used, use as default for fill-in field
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=64
_ make export put a timestamp in the html code (hidden or visible)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=66


PDE / Find & Replace

_ all around very ugly, fix it up
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=67
_ several tweaks
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=68
_   only enable "find next" in menu after a find has happened
_   placing "replace" next to "find" ... (hitting "replace all" by accident) 
_   have a button "replace & find next"
_ allowing to find & replace over multiple tabs 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=69
_ better fix for find/replace focus issue on osx
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=244
_   give that field focus explicitly, rather than just for typing


PDE / History

_ implement new version of history
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71
_   make history folder, and a zip (not gz) file for each entry
_   history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_     could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_     along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_     no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_     checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_     history converter option?
_   only first 20 entries visible?
_   shortcut to walk through history, ala photoshop (ctrl-alt-z)
_   zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)
_   make hooks to history api so others can write tools around it


PDE / Preferences

_ saved window positions.. if displays has changed, becomes a problem
_   record the display that it was on?
_     GraphicsDevice gd = frame.getGraphicsConfiguration().getDevice();
_   make sure that the application is within the bounds of the current display?
_   (from 0, 0 to width, height)
_   messy since some displays have negative coords
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=72
_ split Preferences and PreferencesFrame?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74
_ preferences window has been hit with the ugly stick
_   redo panel to use proper Box layout etc
_   also needs to look good across all platforms
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=73
_ make available the background colors for present mode, stop button color
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=75
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1130781367;start=2#2
_ add ability to set the display where present mode makes things start
_ add pref item for setting the memory properly
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=233
o   external apps should inherit memory settings from p5 itself
_   too confusing to set the memory in two places
_   or perhaps, have a setting in the ide for it
_   and allow a checkbox for "always run externally" 
_   that way people don't have to adjust the memory settings for p5 itself
_   perhaps the memory setting should be enabled/disabled
_     that way if it's enabled, will always run externally


PDE / Runner 

_ stop() not working very well 
_   as a result, dispose() methods aren't being called on libraries
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77
_ NullPointerException inside setup() comes up weird
_   because NullPointerException is a RuntimeException
_   maybe the renderer exception is something different? newrendex?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=78
_ exception in setup() on external app doesn't kill run button 
_   also doesn't kill external vm
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=79
_ quitting from present mode doesn't kill run button
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80
_ exceptions in draw() apps aren't caught
_   the program resize(200, 200); just does nothing (doesn't complain)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=81
_ weird exception in the run button watcher
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=42


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ may need a progress bar for "save as"
_   or just the file copy function in general
_   since it may take a long time (i.e. 1000s of screen grabs)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=82
_ "save as" shouldn't show always show save as dialog
_   unless that's the current mode that's being used
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=83
_ handle renaming with case changes (currently ignores case change)
_   see notes/bitching in Sketch.nameCode()
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=85
_ "save as" loses cursor/scroll positions (because reloading)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=86
_ setting sketchbook to a folder on a network mounted drive
_   does this work? test on both on mac and pc.. 
_   or if not, should recommend people against it 
_   (i.e. folders disappearing if net has trouble)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=87
_ some type of sketch archive format for posting examples (.psk?)
_   would be nice to open a sketch directly from a zip file
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=88



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



TOOLS / General

_ need method for showing prefs for the tools
_   add pref to handle date vs. increment on archive sketch
_ make dynamically loaded plugins and "tools" menu
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=124
_   break out beautify as its own plugin
_   tools api:
_     init() -> run when p5 is first launched
_     isAvailable() -> true/false whether the option should be dimmed
_       skip this for now, not sending events to tools all the time
_     show() -> open the window or run the tool
_       is there a better name than show() since not all will be visible?
_       maybe it's just a run() method launched via invokeLater()?
_     hide() -> hide the tool's frame
_     getDefaultShortcut() -> returns the default shortcut this tools wants
_       store this in the data file instead
_     needs to be able to get current sketch code
_     look at the pretty-formatting code to see what else needs to be in api
o     getMenu() -> return non-null the tool is a submenu
o       no, bad idea.. don't want a zillion submenus on things
_ need a proper means to handle command keys for tools
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=140
_ external editor -> add a command to launch
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=141
_ add tool for running in jview
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=142
_   calls export, or only available after export (or when an applet dir exists)
_   warn user that applet html will be over-written
_ add tool to "Add custom html to sketch"
_   that copies applet.html, 
_   opens sketch folder, 
_   and gives info about what to do next (how to edit)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=143
_ tool to run in appletviewer? sun.applet.Main is appletviewer
_ small gray gap shows up in color picker
_   getMaximumSize() not being respected on Windows (Linux?)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=310


TOOLS / Auto Format

_ do a better job of maintaining cursor during beautify 
_ only auto format a particular section of code
_   set the 'tabs' var based on how many spaces on previous line
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217
_ removes code with extra parens or braces
_   (an extra } brace deleting everything after it)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=109
_ progressively eats code w/ certain brace settings
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=235
_ Auto Format hangs when a non-terminated ' is included
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=236
_ hex colors don't get formatted
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=303


TOOLS / Create Font

_ loading is very slow on the first time (getting all font names)
_   create the tool object on startup, then use thread to getAllFonts()
_   show a progress/status bar while it's happening?
_   (would be useful to at least tell user that system not locked up)
_ create font with user-specified charsets
_   may help solve: http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=98
_ when resizing window, only resize the text display area
_   just a matter of moving around the panels and BorderLayout
_ remember previous font selection when returning to the window

LIBRARIES / General

_ need to unpack InvocationTargetException in xxxxxxEvent calls
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=VideoCamera;action=display;num=1116850328#3
_ unregisterXxxx() calls to remove methods from libs
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=312


LIBRARIES / Video

_ reading movie is really really slow (2-3 fps)
_   possible improvement from qtjava list added
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=40
_ Movie needs the crop() functions ala Capture
_ tearing and incomplete updates on capture?
_   putting read() inside draw() seems to eliminate this?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=114
_ video doesn't work in applets
_   on export, need to first import applet's packages before qt et al
_   video working in applets? (no, never did in alpha so untested)
_     Movie should perhaps work?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=44
_ pause and framerate aren't working
_   framerate does set the frequency which movieEvent will be called, 
_   but it is not setting the "available" field corrrectly. 
_   sketch .zip file in casey's email message
_ video wrong device name crashes things
_ when passing in 'null' as the capture, dialog pops up fine
_   but the applet craps out after a few seconds (pinwheel spin)
_ couldn't get req'd component also happens when the capture isn't ready
_   may also mean that no camera is plugged in
_   also, don't mention winvdig on the mac
_ if user cancels prompt, throws a '-128,userCanceledErr'
_   in which case, need to return null (or ""?) for the prompt
_   which will also just give you the last camera
_   should it be new Camera(PROMPT);
_ saveFrame() directly to quicktime via port of DbnRecorder
_   do this after beta, not likely to work with java 1.4 on macosx
_ audio stops working after two seconds
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=277


LIBRARIES / Net

_ move the useful serial buffering fxns into net library
_ make the Client list public
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1116056805


LIBRARIES / Serial

_ port buffering not working properly
_   may just be a problem with thread starvation
_   bufferUntil() fires an event but continues to fill up the buffer
_   bug report includes patch from mellis
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=96
_ add prompt() method to Serial (simple dialog box that pops up)

DIST

How the environment gets packed up, downloaded, and installed.


DIST / General 

_ move build scripts to something better like ant
_   too much to maintain the multiple versions, too much code
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=151
_   also update build/howto.txt (of course) because it says no ant
_ update things for java 1.5 since it's inevitable
_ need .pde document icons
_ need .psk file icon
_ need exported application icons
_ also out of cvs
_   check for necessary tools to be installed
_   zip, unzip, jikes, etc
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known bugs'
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known suggestions'
_ javadoc "advanced" reference by beta
_   and then finalizing it towards 1.0
_   document hint() commands for advanced reference
_ write notes about running p5 on another platforms 
_   this was some feedback from running on bsd:
_     /usr/local/jdk1.3.1/bin/java -cp lib:lib/build:lib/pde.jar:lib/kjc.jar:lib/oro.jar:java/lib/ext/comm.jar PdeBase 
_   need to use the 1.3 vm, and get a fake platform name
_   otherwise, goes looking for lib/pde_.properties or something
o modify antlr stuff to conditionally recompile in make.sh
_   compile antlr inside the initial setup of the work dir
X     done for macosx
_     fix this for windows and linux
_ about box 
_   bring up information about gpl, lgpl, and ibmpl
_   jedit syntax is under mit license
_     http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
_ different name for 'lib' folder because of libraries folder?
_   avoid some confusion for when describing the libraries folder to users
_ remove jvm from cvs
_   use wget to grab it if it doesn't exist
_   and include an md5hash to see if the file is correct


DIST / Windows

_ make .pde files double-clickable from windows
X   on drag, are these already passed to argv[]?

_   figure out proper registry key for windows
_     can be handled when the app first run (jni?)
_   write handler for main() to take document names
_ track down the cause of the processing.exe not starting bugs

_ winamp/audio getting starved or crackly while applets running
_   thread priority too high? or something weird
_ need splash screen, startup takes a long time
_ processing.exe: problem if expert version is run, and no java installed
_   call the person a genius and tell them to install java
_ NullPointerException when alt is pressed
_   (not our bug, but log it in the bug db anyways)
_   might be something to do with the applet frame being an awt not swing
_   event first goes to the applet listener, needs to consume the event

DIST / Mac OS X

_ set nice background for disk image on macosx
_ test more to see if runtime exceptions are coming through
_ track down error in PdeCompiler for message parsing
_   was missing the error about a package being gone
_   can comment out /System/Library/ as a test
_ Contents/Resources/Java can take jnilib files
_ set file type/creator for .pde files of examples
_ would be nice to have macosx packaged up as a single .app file
_ is there a way to set the color of the Frame growbox?
_   currently it's white instead of dark gray like the ui
_   setBackground(Color) didn't seem to help inside PdeBase.<init>
_ use disk:// notation as panther alternative
_   so that it doesn't download the disk, just mounts it
_   although.. this only works on panther.. how many are using it?
_ mac standard key combinations for moving around in the editor

_ some reports of it not quitting properly, but not confirmed
_ splash screen
