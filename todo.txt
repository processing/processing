X run java mode when large 'data' folder is in use
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081542378
X fixed one bug in PdeRuntime error message stuff 
X   was this the big one? a big one?

040715 late
X threading issues resolved
X fixed bug with errors not coming through
X fixed bug with errors not being recognized amonst exceptions
X fixed bug with draw mode apps, they now run inside setup
X   width/height wasn't getting set during setup(), so window bad
X moving p5 prefs on mac into documents? or inside sketchbook?
X   Documents -> Processing -> preferences.txt
X   do the same for windows, with sketchbook as a subfolder

040716 evening
o don't exit p5 if platform is unknown
o "save as" needs to update the editorheader
X   couldn't replicate this
X MAJOR: make .pde files embed themselves into the main class
o readUntil() should do the proper thing if the data is not available
o   i.e. either return null, or block until it's available? -> ret null
X "paste" isn't setting the "modified" bit for PdeEditor
X   i.e. cut -> new file -> paste doesn't mark any as changed

_ processing.net -> PClient, PServer

_ change font api to not use leading() as a way to reset the leading
_ don't change the size of a font when in screen space mode

_ "add library" menu item and submenu
_   iterate through the 'library' folders
_ dll and jnilib files have to be in the p5 folder (confirmed by amit)
_   there should be other places that they work.. 
_   could even copy the dll to the p5 folder from the code folder
_ libraries: static and non-static init for libs
_   final stop() for static shutdown of lib
_   but also potential stop() for individual items
_   simong: request a preloop and postloop call for libraries
_     this would avoid having to patch BApplet
_ where do libraries for distribution go?
_   libraries subfolder of p5? or inside examples?
_ String in apache classes and java.lang
_   maybe ignore classes not inside the p5 libs dir?
_   need to be able to select between which to include
_   auto-resolve by saying java.* wins, others ask

_ get export working again
_   make multiple jar files thing work.. blech
_   include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_     or rename the old applet folder to something else? (nah, too many)
_   don't force everything into a single .jar on export
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1067360903;start=0

_ support for editor plugins
_   make beautify plugin ("autoformat"?)
_   make dynamically loaded plugins and "tools" menu
_     break out beautify as its own plugin

   1 _ beautify

   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1067309918;start=0
   1 _   ignores colons for case statements
   1 _   need to tie this to the parser instead
   1 _ do a better job of maintaining cursor during beautify 
   1 _ only beautify a particular section of code
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217

_ make "get quicktime libs" function
_   can java get the root directory for system/win32 etc?

_ processing.app -> PdeBase, PdeEditor..

_ api for file-based renderers
_   need to work this out since it will affect other api changes
_   size(0, 0) and then ai.size(10000, 20000)
_   saveFrame(PRenderer) or saveFrame("name", PRenderer)

_ text(String text, x, y, width, height)  // based on rectMode
_   textMode() for align left, center, right (no justify.. har!)

_ implement new version of history
_   make history folder, and a zip (not gz) file for each entry
_   history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_     could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_     along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_     no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_     checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_     history converter option?
_   only first 20 entries visible?
_   zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)

_ quicktime full uninstall/reinstall
_   installing winvdig
_ code folder problems - antivirus or firewall
_ update readme with notes from bboard about "built with processing"


......................................................................


really nasty bugs (fix in 0070 if possible)
_ threading issues on casey's laptop
_ odd error in System.err stream coming from running external
_   dies after a while or goes weird
_   make sure exceptions with .class work
_ openStream returning 'null' really horked up the letters applet
_   no System.out was coming through
_   System.err was getting cut off before finishing


0071 or later
_ write export-to-application
_   lock feature for present mode (part of export to application?)
_   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
_   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
_   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
_   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works
_   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
_   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
_     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
_   also make sure pack() is happening
_   add manifest.mf to exported applets so that applications will work
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1045983103;start=0
_   BApplet.main(new String[] { "flashcards3" });
_     this will need to detect whether the user has their own main()
_     or even BApplet.main(new String[] { getClass().getName() });
_     META-INF/MANIFEST.MF contains just "Main-Class: ClassName"
_     main sticking point will be serial/qtjava in exports
_ write export-to-library
_   need to be able to produce the serial, video, etc libs
_   see if sonia project can compile
_ implement horizontal version of PdeEditorButtons

_ menu option for Renderer > to "Core" or "OpenGL"
_   on export, uses this setting to determine if jogl is added to project
_ netscape.javascript not properly working in 1.4
_   include 'netscape.javascript' as a library to be added
_     but don't export it.. ugh..
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1088034754;start=0
_ add a "make archive" option
_   doesn't rename sketch, just names zip file sketch + time stamp
_ need showError/Message/Warning/Prompt design from casey
_   maybe something that shows stack trace?
_   with an 'email this' button? (include source code too?)
_   also need a "prompt" dialog for asking filenames, etc
_   implement and remove PdeEditorStatus stuff
_ check into open-source paperwork for p5

PDE - Processing Development Environment


PDE / Details

   b _ running present mode with a bug in the program hoses things
   b _   make sure the program compiles before starting present mode
   1 _ processing.exe: problem if expert version is run, and no java installed
   1 _   call the person a genius and tell them to install java
   1 _ make some fancy extendo things because the tabs get too big

   1 _ properly open .pde files opened from explorer/finder

   1 _ implement page setup and print
   1 _   pretty printing of code in project
   1 _   option to just print all code in project
   1 _   option to export all the code as colored html

   1 _ p5 becomes a memory hog (benelek and glen murphy)
   1 _   even without sketches open, perhaps not gc'ing properly
   1 _   objects probably not getting finalized
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1050134854;start=0

   1 _ need to check if volume is read-only, notify and quit if it is
   1 _   people are trying to run off the disk image
   1 _   need to pay attention to when running from read-only drive
   1 _     reported by brandenberg
   1 _    "p5 will launch from the disk image, but will 
   1 _     not draw the sketch name bar doesn't appear"

   1 _ size() has memory limitations (pitaru)
   1 _   catch OutOfMemoryError inside size() and let the user know
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1038847001
   1 _ verify editor buttons working properly
   1 _   they're not.. mostly unresponsive, and often get stuck
   1 _   is play button properly unhighlighting? 
   1 _     does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
   1 _     also when using draw() instead of loop()
   1 _       applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
   1 _   if export fails (compile error) need deselect
   1 _ exceptions in draw() apps aren't caught
   1 _   the program resize(200, 200); just does nothing (doesn't complain)
   1 _ if 'void' left out before loop or setup, cryptic message about
   1 _   'constructor loop must be named Temporary_23498_2343'
   1 _   add a better handler for this specific thing?
   1 _ menu weirdness (benelek)
   1 _   when u've got a menu open, move a cursor over the text area
   1 _   and back over the menu, the text-area cursor type remains. 
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1043667859
   1 _ scroll bar has some painting weirdness with jedit textarea
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1042351684
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083787569
   1 _ rename/saveas doesn't properly have its focus set
   1 _   under windows, immediately typing after rename doesn't select
   1 _   the whole thing is selected, but not directly editable
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1075149929
   1 _ Ctrl-Z will undo, but not scroll to where the undo happens. 
   1 _   so user thinks nothing is happening and overundo. 
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064220242;start=0
   1 _ figure out how to cancel 'save changes' on macosx and windows
   1 _   macosx handleQuit seems to force termination (at least on 1.3)
   1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064732330;start=0
   1 _ don't cache stuff from loadStrings and others

   1 _ find/replace
   1 _   add support for hitting 'ESC'
   1 _   option to ignore or match case
   1 _   when hitting 'find', select the text in the field
   1 _     give that field focus explicitly, rather than just for typing
   1 _     right now, typing works, but no caret, no blue highlight
   1 _     and on second find run, should instead select all the find string
   1 _       so that typing will replace it directly
   1 _   only enable "find next" in menu after a find has happened

   1 _ drag & drop implementation to add files to sketch

FRY

My grab of examples/libraries that I'd like to make. Most of these are
things I've already written in some form or another, but need to take
the time to package up and release.

_ example showing quicksort code
_   and how to implement/use as an inner class
_ arcball
_ joystick
_ particles (from multip?)
_ phyics & collisions
_   look at the 'havoc' physics library
_ java3d classes for vec3f and matrix
_ quicktime exporter or image sequence export
_   fairly quick--just use experimental code from dbn
_ more advanced splitting of files into rows/cols uses another class
_   other class also has concept for random access of lines
_   by storing the line positions, can access without loading all
_   into memory because some files will be too large
_   read table/csv formatted data into a matrix
_     pseudo-database format version of this that stores indexes to file
_       rather than loading the whole thing at once
_ history.. add my diffs sketch (as a plug-in)
_   could just include a compiled version of the diff app, ala jikes
_ something about using regexps in p5
_   wrap up oro for simple matching
_   (as alternative to the sun classes.. link to those in the docs)
_ method for file handling, recursive walk-through a directory
_   file i/o: file listing util that leaves out . and ..

more random thoughts
_ stroke picker
_   just lineweight, so don't bother.. use constants palette instead
_ font picker
_   same thing, just quickly generates fonts on the fly and applies them
_ need to look at matlab's visualization tools
_ arcs, better 'color' object
_ take everything in perl cookbook, and make easy to do with p5
_ database access and reading large files are always hangups
_ support capabilities of matlab's visualization tools
_ charting/labeling primitives.. excel never quite does it
_ botting engine
_ difficulty of initial grab/analysis of data, that may take some time
_   then needs to be stored and run on multiple times
_ methods for picking colors.. how to color code, limit to 5? gradients..
_ simple way to do tufte-style small multiples on an app
_ function for reporting percent finished (or swing dialog)
_ also for reporting the amount of time remaining
_ loading/selecting a file (or folder), or from command line
_ load large file as lattice (option of whether to keep in memory)
_   how many rows/columns for headings
_ walking through an entire directory, with a handler
_   that throws out the . and .. items
_   that knows about aliases (jdk13)
_ overall contrast/color control (genomevalence for hulk)
