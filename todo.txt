_ runtime exceptions have stopped coming through (on pc only?)
_   test with florian example for the exception stuff
_   that they don't show up in the error bar
_   make sure this is no longer the case

_ error messages from external not coming through very well
_   especially on macosx.. is it writing to stdout.txt tho?
_   figure out why it's killing things early? the process maybe?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1114520230;start=5

_ make simple tool for casey to rebuild all the examples at once
_   just make it easier to go to the next sketch
_   need to rebuild with this release because of 1.3/1.4 issues

bugzilla
_ get these two todo lists into their bugzilla categories
_ setup bugzilla and enter all the bugs

discuss with casey
_ auto-run the javadoc in dist.sh
_   doctor a copy of the css file to use p5 defaults
_   and re-copy the css in after generating the doc each time
_ documentation on tabs: .java files, inner classes, etc
_   additional tabs are added to the main code
_   as a result, static variables can't be used
_     though they can go above the class itself or be placed in the parent
_   if you want it separate, use a .java file instead (not parsed)
_   classes in tabs are inner classes, or use .java files

_ built in functions.. may not always be fastest, we're going for correct
_   most things have other ways of making things much faster
_   we've attempted for less confusion over speed in some cases
_   get(), set() and red() et al are one such example
_ is there a way to do xxx?
_   advanced users who are outgrowing the basic reference: 
_   be sure to check the "complete" reference
_ web colors with alpha: 0xffcc0080 or unhex("ffcc0080")

PDE - Processing Development Environment


PDE / Base

_ settings.path.fallback not being used
_   really important for intl versions that are having trouble
_   or ask for the sketch folder name.. why isn't it?
_ can't seem to find build dir on operating systems w/ non-ascii chars
_   or rather, when user accounts have non-ascii chars in the name
_   try setting up an account where this is the case
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1114207259
_ option to suppress warning dialogs
_   starting with the one about modifying the sketch name for spaces


PDE / Compiler (and preprocessor?)

_ don't allow goofy case versions of reserved words
_   keypressed should maybe throw an error
_ an empty .java tab will throw an error
_ if NullPointerEx on a line that includes a "pixels[" 
_   give an error message saying "you may need to call loadPixels"
_ warn about writing non-1.1 code. 
X   will jikes do it if the -source is set to 1.1? nope.. 
X     notes inside PdeCompiler
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1079867179;start=0
_ don't all mousepressed(), throw a compile error
_ colorMode(RGB) -> caps being off
_ making it easier to draw shapes
_ missing semicolons - better error message
_ missing brackets, unmatched brackets
_ "unexpected token void" -> "You're mixing dynamic and static mode"
_ forgetting the quotes around strings
_ separate reference for /dev version
_ loadImage() using spaces in the name
_   if loadImage() with spaces when online(), throw an error
_ files not in the data folder (works in env, not in sketch)
_ NullPointerException on unterminated comment at end of code
_   (and OutOfMemoryError and weird lockup)
_ not enough args for triangle (or args in general) 
_   throws out bizarre message 


PDE / Console

_ println() can hose the app for the first 20-30 frames
_   need to figure out threading etc
_   problem with it launching a new thread for every single update!
_ printing 32k chars to console w/o a line break will cause massive error
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1115470426;start=0


PDE / Details

_ lock the minimum size for the main processing editor frame
_   if it's made too small, stuff from the bottom disappears

_ tab to just indent lines properly, 
_   rather than having it convert to spaces

_ setting sketchbook to a folder on the network
_   does this work? test on both on mac and pc.. 
_   or if not, should recommend people against it 
_   (i.e. folders disappearing if net has trouble)

_ exception in setup() on external app doesn't kill run button 
_   also doesn't kill external vm
_ quitting from present mode doesn't kill run button
_ package processing.app for PdeBase, PdeEditor..

_ add mnemonics for menus (alt-f to open 'file')

_ implement page setup and print
_   pretty printing of code in project
_   option to just print all code in project
_   option to export all the code as colored html

_ p5 becomes a memory hog (benelek and glen murphy)
_   even without sketches open, perhaps not gc'ing properly
_   objects probably not getting finalized
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1050134854;start=0

_ size() has memory limitations (pitaru)
_   catch OutOfMemoryError inside size() and let the user know
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1038847001
_ exceptions in draw() apps aren't caught
_   the program resize(200, 200); just does nothing (doesn't complain)
_ if 'void' left out before loop or setup, cryptic message about
_   'constructor loop must be named Temporary_23498_2343'
_   add a better handler for this specific thing?
_ menu weirdness (benelek)
_   when u've got a menu open, move a cursor over the text area
_   and back over the menu, the text-area cursor type remains. 
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1043667859
_ scroll bar has some painting weirdness with jedit textarea
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1042351684
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083787569
_ rename/saveas doesn't properly have its focus set
_   under windows, immediately typing after rename doesn't select
_   the whole thing is selected, but not directly editable
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1075149929
_ save changes doesn't properly set focus
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Suggestions;action=display;num=1115487608;start=0
_ figure out how to cancel 'save changes' on macosx and windows
_   macosx handleQuit seems to force termination (at least on 1.3)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064732330;start=0
_ dim edit menus as appropriate during selection/no selection/etc
_ make export put a timestamp in the html code (hidden or visible)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1075659029

_ properly handle ENTER, Ctrl-W and ESC on all dialogs
_   there must be a proper "swing" way of doing this that doesn't
_   involve adding key listeners to every friggin component
_   ESC should fake a cancel button press
_   ENTER should do the default option
_   (might be a matter of setting the default action for the window?)

_ some type of sketch archive format for posting examples (.psk?)
_   would be nice to open a sketch directly from a zip file

_ subfolders in the 'data' directory don't work


PDE / Editor

_ when running with external editor, hide the editor text area
_ drag & drop implementation to add files to sketch
_ tabs and spaces, command keys don't work w/ shift
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1114661169;start=0
_ switch to newer revision of jedit?
_   is enormous horizontal scroller issue fixed properly
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083787569
_ mouse wheel broken in the text editor? (windows jdk 1.5?) 

undo problems
_ Ctrl-Z will undo, but not scroll to where the undo happens. 
_   so user thinks nothing is happening and overundo. 
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064220242;start=0
_ undo has become sluggish, gets cleared on save?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Suggestions;action=display;num=1114103943;start=0


PDE / Find & Replace

_ only enable "find next" in menu after a find has happened


PDE / Editor Buttons

_ when holding down shift, show the alt behavior for EditorHeader
_ verify editor buttons working properly
_   they're not.. mostly unresponsive, and often get stuck
_   is play button properly unhighlighting? 
_     does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
_     also when using draw() instead of loop()
_       applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_   if export fails (compile error) need deselect


PDE / Editor Header

_ make some fancy extendo things because the tabs get too big
_   either condense or popdown menu thingy
_ ctrl-tab to switch between tabs


PDE / Editor Status

_ error messages run off the edge and go invisible
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1074894329
_ multi-line errors a mess in jikes
_   maybe a dropdown list thing, with the first just shown?
_ move to modal dialog showError/Message/Warning/Prompt design 
_   nicely design dialog boxes to go with visual of p5
_   maybe something that shows stack trace?
_   with an 'email this' button? (include source code too?)
_   also need a "prompt" dialog for asking filenames, etc
_   implement and remove PdeEditorStatus stuff


PDE / History

_ implement new version of history
_   make history folder, and a zip (not gz) file for each entry
_   history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_     could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_     along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_     no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_     checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_     history converter option?
_   only first 20 entries visible?
_   zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1080346981;start=0
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1088333655;start=0
_   shortcut to walk through history, ala photoshop (ctrl-alt-z)


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ transparently convert spaces to underscores (?)
_   underscoring everything is kinda nasty
_ if a .pde isn't contained in a properly named folder
_   offer to rename the parent folder, rather than placing in a new folder
_ may need a progress bar for "save as"
_   or just the file copy function in general
_   since it may take a long time (i.e. 1000s of screen grabs)
_ "save as" shouldn't show save as dialog for sketches 
_   unless that's the current mode that's being used
_ scanning sketchbook folder may be extremely slow 
_   not sure why this would be the case
_ handle renaming with case changes (currently ignores case change)
_   see notes/bitching in Sketch.nameCode()
_ "save as" loses cursor/scroll positions (because reloading)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Suggestions;action=display;num=1115486342;start=0


PDE / Runner 

_ stop() not working very well
_   doesn't seem to actually be stopping things
_ closing window w/o first hitting stop() causes freak out
_   opengl gives an OutOfMemoryError
_   java2d just goes into a lock
_   could also be code that's in an infinite loop (i.e. text error) 
_     which then causes a full lock
_ something really bad happened with println() in this release
_   perhaps only without a code folder and/or running in java2d mode?
_   this may also be what's hosing 
_ external apps don't stop at all when 'stop' is hit
_   worker thread is halting the app ala code folder bug
_   could this be dealt with by using nio? 
_     host environment will be running 1.4 so...
_ npe is a runtimeex, so any npe in setup comes up weird
_   maybe the renderer exception is something different? newrendex?
_ if in full java mode
_   if extends PApplet.. or rather, put PApplet cast into a 
_   try/catch block.. if it doesn't work, try applet. if that
_   doesn't work, try using the class' main() to run it


PDE / Export

_ write export-to-application
_   problem with packages.. currently mainClassName is preproc name
_     and "name" is the sketch name, w/o package
_     but if a package were in use, then would be trouble
_   lock feature for present mode (part of export to application?)
_   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
_   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
_   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
_   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works
_   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
_   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
_     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
_   also make sure pack() is happening
_   add manifest.mf to exported applets so that applications will work
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1045983103;start=0
_   BApplet.main(new String[] { "flashcards3" });
_     this will need to detect whether the user has their own main()
_     or even BApplet.main(new String[] { getClass().getName() });
_     META-INF/MANIFEST.MF contains just "Main-Class: ClassName"
_     main sticking point will be serial/qtjava in exports
_ include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_   or rename the old applet folder to something else? (nah, too messy)
_ make multiple jar files thing work as an option
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1067360903;start=0
_   applet default is one file, application default is multiple
_   user in advanced mode can switch to the other
_   buttons on side of sketch do default (last) behavior
_ need to decide how to handle "stop" button in present mode
_   when running externally, people need to write their own stop function
_   just get export to application working so this can be supported
_   for now, they're stuck w/ running in the env and getting the ugliness


PDE / Preferences

_ saved window positions.. if displays has changed, becomes a problem
_   record the display that it was on?
_     GraphicsDevice gd = frame.getGraphicsConfiguration().getDevice();
_   make sure that the applet is within the bounds of the current display?
_   (from 0, 0 to width, height)
_ make note that changing screen config requires restart of processing
_   static { checkScreens(); }
_   static void PApplet.checkScreens() { } 
_   to run explicitly later
_   this seems too complicated.. just make people restart
_ split Preferences and PreferencesFrame ?
_ preferences window has been hit with the ugly stick
_   redo panel to use proper swing layout etc
_   also needs to look good across all platforms


PDE / Preprocessor

_ straighten out int() -> toInt() conversion in the preproc
_ casting problems in the parser
_   float u = float(x)/width; works.
_   float u = (float(x)/width); doesn't work: "unexpected token: float".
_   float u = (x/float(width)); works! 
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1084011098;start=0
_ if last line of code is a comment with no CR after it,
_   an OutOfMemoryError wants to happen, 
_   but right now there's a hack to add a CR in PdePreprocessor
_ return (int(5.5)) causes an error
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083624993;start=0
_ random, single slash in the code doesn't throw an error
_   (just gets removed by the preprocessor)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1099371066;start=0
_ allow doubles in preproc
_   (for casting, etc) particularly for Math.cos() et al

TOOLS / General
_ how to handle command keys
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Suggestions;action=display;num=1114885272;start=0
_ make dynamically loaded plugins and "tools" menu
_   break out beautify as its own plugin
_ color picker or other things written by folks
_   add all .jar files in lib/plugins on startup
_ make some kind of internal color picker
_   could be a separate window that's always around if needed
_ external editor -> add a command to launch
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1043734580;start=0
_ add tool to hit 'next' to go through examples
_   just make it "next file in folder" since examples are all over
_   also need to copy examples locally
_ add tool for running in jview
_   only available after export (or when an applet dir exists)
_   warn user that applet html will be over-written
_ add tool to "Add custom html to sketch"
_   that copies applet.html, 
_   opens sketch folder, 
_   and gives info about what to do next (how to edit)
_ run in appletviewer? sun.applet.Main is appletviewer


TOOLS / Auto Format

_ do a better job of maintaining cursor during beautify 
_ only auto format a particular section of code
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217


TOOLS / Create Font

_ create the tool object on startup, then use thread to getAllFonts()
_ close/hide window on 'ESC'
_ loading is very slow on the first time (getting all font names)
_   show a progress/status bar while it's happening?
_   (would be useful to at least tell user that system not locked up)
_ font builder chopping off parts of letters
_   this may be fixed?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1076358432;start=0
_ font encoding issues 
_   java seems to force straight windows encoding.. (problem for pi fonts)
_   opentype/cff fonts don't work with live loading from the app
_   many (all?) opentype fonts won't show up or aren't supported
_     this may be only cff fonts that have trouble
_   when encoding is not the standard encoding, problematic
_     so sonata otf and sonata don't seem to have any chars at all
_ available font issues
_   is getFontList returning a different set of fonts from device2d?
_     try it out on java 1.3 versus 1.4
_   getAllFonts() not quite working for many fonts
_   i.e. Orator Std on windows.. macosx seems to be ok
_   is getFamilyNames() any different/better?
_   when did this break? 1.4.1? 1.4.x vs 1.3?
_   may be that cff fonts won't work?
_   or is it only those with ps names?
_ create font with user-specified charsets

LIBRARIES / Video

_ tearing and incomplete updates on capture?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=VideoCamera;action=display;num=1114628335;start=0
_ pause and framerate aren't working
_   framerate does set the frequency which movieEvent will be called, 
_   but it is not setting the "available" field corrrectly. 
_   sketch .zip file in casey's email message
_ video wrong device name crashes things
_ when passing in 'null' as the capture, dialog pops up fine
_   but the applet craps out after a few seconds (pinwheel spin)
_ couldn't get req'd component also happens when the capture isn't ready
_   may also mean that no camera is plugged in
_   also, don't mention winvdig on the mac
_ if user cancels prompt, throws a '-128,userCanceledErr'
_   in which case, need to return null (or ""?) for the prompt
_   which will also just give you the last camera
_   should it be new Camera(PROMPT);
_ saveFrame() directly to quicktime via port of DbnRecorder
_   do this after beta, not likely to work with java 1.4 on macosx


LIBRARIES / Net

_ move the useful serial buffering fxns into net library


LIBRARIES / Serial

_ port buffering not working properly
_   may just be a problem with thread starvation
_   bufferUntil() fires an event but continues to fill up the buffer
_ add prompt() method to Serial (simple dialog box that pops up)

_ processing.exe: problem if expert version is run, and no java installed
_   call the person a genius and tell them to install java
_ p5's exe has trouble when PATH has quotes (or spaces?)

_   CLASSPATH figured out what to do with quotes, but not PATH
_ NullPointerException when alt is pressed
_   (not our bug, but log it in the bug db anyways)
_   might be something to do with the applet frame being an awt not swing
_   event first goes to the applet listener, needs to consume the event

PLATFORMS / Mac OS X

_ fix find/replace focus issue on osx
_   give that field focus explicitly, rather than just for typing
_   right now, typing works, but no caret, no blue highlight
_   and on second find run, should instead select all the find string
_     so that typing will replace it directly
_ set nice background for disk image on macosx
_ test more to see if runtime exceptions are coming through
_ track down error in PdeCompiler for message parsing
_   was missing the error about a package being gone
_   can comment out /System/Library/ as a test
_ Contents/Resources/Java can take jnilib files
_ set file type/creator for .pde files of examples
_ would be nice to have macosx packaged up as a single .app file
_ is there a way to set the color of the Frame growbox?
_   currently it's white instead of dark gray like the ui
_   setBackground(Color) didn't seem to help inside PdeBase.<init>
_ use disk:// notation as panther alternative
_   so that it doesn't download the disk, just mounts it
_   although.. this only works on panther.. how many are using it?
_ mac standard key combinations for moving around in the editor
