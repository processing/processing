0080 pde
X include /** */ comments into the html page
X examples have been updated

fixed in rev 79
X can't scroll the PdeEditorConsole downwards at all on osx

purged
o refresh sketchbook menu upon returning to the app from elsewhere?
o   this would need to track whether coming just from an ext runtime
o make "get quicktime libs" function
o   can java get the root directory for system/win32 etc?


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


MUST BE COMPLETE FOR BETA

_ if NullPointerEx on a line that includes a "pixels[" 
_   give an error message saying "you may need to call loadPixels"


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 


NOT NECESSARY BEFORE BETA

_ .psk file support for bundling sketches


_ move everything to packages, and start auto-javadoc
_   also move the lib folders to a new location

camera
_ list() should return full list with all sub-components
_   find the example code from the board
_ add prompt() method to Camera ("" means default, null is prompt)
_ couldn't get req'd component also happens when the camera isn't ready
_   may also mean that no camera is plugged in
_   also, don't mention winvdig on the mac
_ if user cancels prompt, throws a '-128,userCanceledErr'
_   in which case, need to return null (or ""?) for the prompt
_   which will also just give you the last camera
_   should it be new Camera(PROMPT);
_ error messages from quicktime not coming through very well
_ setting the camera should be an index from list()
_ grabbing sub-devices from camera in the lib (via list() or whatever)
_   actually, need to use numbered indices (multiple w/ same name)
_     list should be: "0 - Logitech QuickCam (Blah)"
_     and then use the indices (or the str i guess) to choose

_ put processing.exe into cvs so that make et al aren't required
_   add 'make' to list of things that should be installed

_ stop() not working very well
_   doesn't seem to actually be stopping things
_ closing window w/o first hitting stop() causes freak out
_   opengl gives an OutOfMemoryError
_   java2d just goes into a lock
_   could also be code that's in an infinite loop (i.e. text error) 
_     which then causes a full lock

_ PdeRuntime/PApplet cleanup
_   run as external whenever using present mode
_   significantly limit range of cases.. if presenting ext is ok
_   uses internal pretty much only when single class, etc

_ the runtime environment requires java 1.4
_   make sure this is known and tested for properly

_ some type of sketch archive format for posting examples
_   would be nice to open a sketch directly from a zip file


Minor issue, but caused me a couple seconds of confusion.  If you rename your sketch then try to close the application without saving first, it asks you if you want to save but mentions the pre-rename name.  But I hit yes, quit, came back in, and all seemed right in the world.

Is it possible that saving with the 'save' button doesn't pay attention to where you point at the project folder from prefs?  Jeez, i phrased that horribly.  I opened preferences for Processing and made the default sketchbook location processing-0079/projects.  I then put all my older projects in that project folder.  When i opened up an old file and made changes, i then hit 'save' and quit.  I relaunched v79 and opened the aforementioned file, and none of the changes were there.  but they were in v77 project folder. 

create a new sketch
create a new tab named "a"
create a new tab named "a_2"
hide tab named "a_2"
hide "a"
unhide "a_2"
unhide "a"
where did "a_2" go ?

(v74) if a project folder is made (with save as), and then deleted while processing is still open, there is an error (of course).  but the error ('file/folder not found') is not displayed to the user, and the drop-downs don't go away / the IDE doesn't refresh.

(74) "save as" not actually saving properly
File>New
edit file...
File>Save As
File>Open some other file
File>Open original file
file is empty.
the only way to make File>Save As actually save new files, as far as i
can tell, is to Save As once, make at least one change, then Save. 

what happens if folder already exists on save as?

_ examples need to be updated

//

check these errors to see if they still exist
_ odd error in System.err stream coming from running external
_   dies after a while or goes weird
_   make sure exceptions with .class work
_ openStream returning 'null' really horked up the letters applet
_   no System.out was coming through
_   System.err was getting cut off before finishing

libraries
_ libraries need to remove the PLibrary interface
_ particles lib requires depth() (but shouldn't)
_   fix for 78 since not sure when simon's new version is happening
X should we queue lib events until the end of loop?
_   nope, libraries can handle that themselves, 
_     and queue events by registering for draw or whatever they'd like
_   lib could call queueEvent with the args
_   then call them inside post()
_ add prompt() method to Serial (simple dialog box that pops up)
_ get an xml library in there
_   nanoxml problems with manifest
_   appears to use 1.6.8 version since it's just two classes

_ straighten out int() -> toInt() conversion in the preproc
_   add use of doubles on casting -- particularly for Math.cos() et al

_ use screen manager to run present mode properly
_   set both versions to require java 1.4
_   change the Info.plist inside macosx
_   and add something to PdeBase to make sure that it's in 1.4

_ subfolders in the 'data' directory don't work

_ don't allow goofy case versions of reserved words
_   keypressed should maybe throw an error

_ "new midlet" option.. keeping things open for midlet projects

_ track loadImage() with filenames that are inconsistent
_   i.e. mixed case filename in sketch is different in windows
_   but when uploaded to a unix server causes a serious problem
_   use canonicalPath to flag possible problems
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1096508877;start=5

_ mouse wheel broken in the text editor? (windows jdk 1.5?) 


......................................................................


PROBLEMS FOR NEW USERS
_ making it easier to draw shapes
_ missing semicolons - better error message
_ missing brackets, unmatched brackets
_ "unexpected token void" -> "You're mixing dynamic and static mode"
_ forgetting the quotes around strings
_ separate reference for /dev version
_ loadImage() mixed case problems
_ loadImage() using spaces in the name
_   if loadImage() when online(), throw an error
_ files not in the data folder (works in env, not in sketch)
_ angleMode(DEGREES) -> mistyped keywords, caps being wrong
_ NullPointerException on unterminated comment at end of code
_   (and OutOfMemoryError and weird lockup)
_ not enough args for triangle (or args in general) 
_   throws out bizarre message 
_ document for new users:
_   what's a NullPointerException
_   use of strings
_   println() for debugging

TALK TO CASEY ABOUT...
_ must call depth() for 3D applications
_ lights cannot be enabled/disabled throughout 
_   lighting will be based on what's left at endFrame()
_ images should be a power of 2, or call modified()
_ document the use of "die" 
_   can override the method to do your own handling
_ sketches no longer require a "data" folder
_ "draw" is not highlighted as a keyword.. other keywords?
_   draw(), PGraphics(), NO_DEPTH_TEST, PMovie(), PMovie.repeat()
_   PClient(), PClient.available(), PClient.read(), 
_   PServer(), PServer.dispose(), PServer.write(), attach(), length
_   round() is not colored
_ example that uses loop/noLoop, or redraw?
_ talk to creas about making html files for bugs, readme, revisions.
_   or how they should relate to the 'faq'.. readme -> faq? 
_ make a sketch that shows loading from the web
_ make another sketch that shows loading from a file
_ make notes about preproc
_   subclasses need to use "public void keyPressed" not "void keyPressed"
_ write a threading example
_   or handle this some more intelligent way, super.stop() is needed.

_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1067383998
_ write an example that uses Hashtable
_ and another that uses Vector
_ need showError/Message/Warning/Prompt design from casey
_   maybe something that shows stack trace?
_   with an 'email this' button? (include source code too?)
_   also need a "prompt" dialog for asking filenames, etc
_   implement and remove PdeEditorStatus stuff
_ beginShape() defaults to beginShape(POLYGON)
_   needs to be noted for the reference
_ make a note that u/v coordinates clamp at 0 and 1
_ no transformations before background() is called
_   implementation specific, may cause trouble

_ different name for 'lib' folder because of libraries folder?
_   avoid some confusion for when describing the libraries folder to users

_ implement new version of history
_   make history folder, and a zip (not gz) file for each entry
_   history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_     could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_     along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_     no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_     checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_     history converter option?
_   only first 20 entries visible?
_   zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)

_   shortcut to walk through history, ala photoshop (ctrl-alt-z)


editor tools menu
_ make dynamically loaded plugins and "tools" menu
_   break out beautify as its own plugin
_ make beautify plugin "Auto Format"
_   //for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
_   } catch (IOException e) { }

_ do a better job of maintaining cursor during beautify 
_ only beautify a particular section of code
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217
_ color picker or other things written by folks
_   add all .jar files in lib/plugins on startup
_ make some kind of internal color picker
_   could be a separate window that's always around if needed
_ external editor -> add a command to launch
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1043734580;start=0
_ add tool to hit 'next' to go through examples
_   just make it "next file in folder" since examples are all over
_   also need to copy examples locally
_ add tool for running in jview
_   only available after export (or when an applet dir exists)
_   warn user that applet html will be over-written
_ add tool to "Add custom html to sketch"
_   that copies applet.html, 
_   opens sketch folder, 
_   and gives info about what to do next (how to edit)


export stuff
_ write export-to-application
_   lock feature for present mode (part of export to application?)
_   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
_   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
_   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
_   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works
_   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
_   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
_     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
_   also make sure pack() is happening
_   add manifest.mf to exported applets so that applications will work
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1045983103;start=0
_   BApplet.main(new String[] { "flashcards3" });
_     this will need to detect whether the user has their own main()
_     or even BApplet.main(new String[] { getClass().getName() });
_     META-INF/MANIFEST.MF contains just "Main-Class: ClassName"
_     main sticking point will be serial/qtjava in exports
_ include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_   or rename the old applet folder to something else? (nah, too messy)
_ make multiple jar files thing work as an option
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1067360903;start=0
_   applet default is one file, application default is multiple
_   user in advanced mode can switch to the other
_   buttons on side of sketch do default (last) behavior

PDE / Save, Save As, Sketchbook

   1 _ transparently convert spaces to underscores (?)
   1 _   underscoring everything is kinda nasty
   1 _ if a .pde isn't contained in a properly named folder
   1 _   offer to rename the parent folder, rather than placing in a new folder
   1 _ may need a progress bar for "save as"
   1 _   or just the file copy function in general
   1 _   since it may take a long time (i.e. 1000s of screen grabs)
   1 _ "save as" shouldn't show save as dialog for sketches 
   1 _   unless that's the current mode that's being used

b _ need to change all the copyrights over to mit "except where noted"
b _ need more comprehensive list of 'known bugs'
b _ need more comprehensive list of 'known suggestions'
b _ javadoc "advanced" reference by beta
b _   and then finalizing it towards 1.0
b _   document hint() commands for advanced reference
b _ beta release will include source code
b _ write notes about running p5 on another platforms 
b _   this was some feedback from running on bsd:
b _     /usr/local/jdk1.3.1/bin/java -cp lib:lib/build:lib/pde.jar:lib/kjc.jar:lib/oro.jar:java/lib/ext/comm.jar PdeBase 
b _   need to use the 1.3 vm, and get a fake platform name
b _   otherwise, goes looking for lib/pde_.properties or something
1 _ if size() not found in export/compile, ask the user
1 _   size(myWidth, myHeight) -> set static var in BGraphics
1 _     for the last size that was used, use as default for fill-in field
1 o modify antlr stuff to conditionally recompile in make.sh
1 _   compile antlr inside the initial setup of the work dir
1 X     done for macosx
1 _     fix this for windows and linux
1 _ about box 
1 _   bring up information about gpl, lgpl, and ibmpl
1 _   jedit syntax is under mit license

DISTRIBUTION / Mac OS X
1 _ fix find/replace focus issue on osx
1 _     give that field focus explicitly, rather than just for typing
1 _     right now, typing works, but no caret, no blue highlight
1 _     and on second find run, should instead select all the find string
1 _       so that typing will replace it directly
b _ set nice background for disk image on macosx
1 _ test more to see if runtime exceptions are coming through
1 _ track down error in PdeCompiler for message parsing
1 _   was missing the error about a package being gone
1 _   can comment out /System/Library/ as a test
1 _ Contents/Resources/Java can take jnilib files
1 _ set file type/creator for .pde files of examples
1 _ would be nice to have macosx packaged up as a single .app file
1 _ is there a way to set the color of the Frame growbox?
1 _   currently it's white instead of dark gray like the ui
1 _   setBackground(Color) didn't seem to help inside PdeBase.<init>
1 _ use disk:// notation as panther alternative
1 _   so that it doesn't download the disk, just mounts it
1 _   although.. this only works on panther.. how many are using it?
1 _ mac standard key combinations for moving around in the editor

FRY

My grab of examples/libraries that I'd like to make. Most of these are
things I've already written in some form or another, but need to take
the time to package up and release.

_ example showing quicksort code
_   and how to implement/use as an inner class
_ arcball
_ joystick
_ particles (from multip?)
_ phyics & collisions
_   look at the 'havoc' physics library
_ java3d classes for vec3f and matrix
_ quicktime exporter or image sequence export
_   fairly quick--just use experimental code from dbn
_ more advanced splitting of files into rows/cols uses another class
_   other class also has concept for random access of lines
_   by storing the line positions, can access without loading all
_   into memory because some files will be too large
_   read table/csv formatted data into a matrix
_     pseudo-database format version of this that stores indexes to file
_       rather than loading the whole thing at once
_ history.. add my diffs sketch (as a plug-in)
_   could just include a compiled version of the diff app, ala jikes
_ something about using regexps in p5
_   wrap up oro for simple matching
_   (as alternative to the sun classes.. link to those in the docs)
_ method for file handling, recursive walk-through a directory
_   file i/o: file listing util that leaves out . and ..

more random thoughts
_ stroke picker
_   just lineweight, so don't bother.. use constants palette instead
_ font picker
_   same thing, just quickly generates fonts on the fly and applies them
_ need to look at matlab's visualization tools
_ arcs, better 'color' object
_ take everything in perl cookbook, and make easy to do with p5
_ database access and reading large files are always hangups
_ support capabilities of matlab's visualization tools
_ charting/labeling primitives.. excel never quite does it
_ botting engine
_ difficulty of initial grab/analysis of data, that may take some time
_   then needs to be stored and run on multiple times
_ methods for picking colors.. how to color code, limit to 5? gradients..
_ simple way to do tufte-style small multiples on an app
_ function for reporting percent finished (or swing dialog)
_ also for reporting the amount of time remaining
_ loading/selecting a file (or folder), or from command line
_ load large file as lattice (option of whether to keep in memory)
_   how many rows/columns for headings
_ walking through an entire directory, with a handler
_   that throws out the . and .. items
_   that knows about aliases (jdk13)
_ overall contrast/color control (genomevalence for hulk)
_ mac -> vlw (or sbit?) font converter
_   need to also read the fond for metrics
_ general bitmap font editor, see what chars are in font, etc
