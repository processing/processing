4 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1065


[ needs verification ] 

_ export and export to application fail with umlauts in folder name
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=252
_ stop button needs to update itself and work properly [1.0]
_   also editor buttons to light up and clear properly 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=396
_   need someone to go out and test all scenarios of this


[ known bugs ]

_ command line support is currently broken
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1048
_   some fixes can be found in the bug report
_ video library threading problems with other libraries
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=882
_   using Capture.list() before size() sometimes works
_   also placing OpenGL inside the extensions directory
_ serial.available() broken with video
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=829
_ first few frames of OpenGL sketches on Windows run slowly
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=874
_ Slow response or spinning wheel from the menu bar on Mac OS X
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=786
_ sometimes not launching
_   this seems to be a threading problem, like an NPE on load/open
_   probaby related to the other load/save sync errors
_ significant point() and set() slowdown on OS X
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1094


with casey
_ specifically add "eclipse" to integration description
_ link books and sample chapters from the "getting started" portion of the faq
_ keep examples.zip in a zip file? (5000 files @ 30 MB instead of 15 MB zip)
_   mark examples as untitled (rather than read-only)
_   maybe even pull these directly from the zip file?
_ load examples from zip files
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1049
_   disallow add file to sketch, export, export application
_   pretty much anything inside the sketch?
_   but don't do this with untitled, cuz it kinda stinks
_   this is too weird--just put examples into individual zip files
_   mark example files as untitled
_   though will that require the sketch to be saved before export?
_ find in reference issues
_   if() and for() don't work, they look for for_.html instead of for.html
_   XMLElement is not linked for find in ref
_   the ? operator is not in find in ref (no ref page either?)
_ update keywords generator script on the site
_   perhaps move this closer to the dev process?
_ move reference folder around so that it matches site organization
_   otherwise several links break on the main faq page
_ discuss i18n issues and proper system (?)
_ look through 404 issues on the site
_ TRIANGLE_STRIP not highlighted for "find in reference"
_   nor is it listed on the reference page
_   so students can't find the ref for it
_   needs to link TRIANGLE_STRIP to the beginShape() reference


libraries and classpaths [1.0]
_ versioning info 
_   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/extensions/versioning.html
_ java.ext.dirs for /System/Library/Java/Extensions
_   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html
_   can set java.ext.dirs to something else 
_   on osx, just ignore anything in /Library/Java/Extensions (but not others)?
_ native lib stuff, use native.txt in lib folder, then:
_   String osName = System.getProperty("os.name");
_   String osArch = System.getProperty("os.arch");
X update to jogl 1.1.1
X   do this with enhanced library/platform support
X see how platform is determined by jogl / use for lib import
_ add control for dependencies (i.e. svg needs xml), needed for export
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=518
_ add "pretty menu name" to the export.txt file
_ move export.txt to xml? (nah, it's only flat information)
_ need better platform designation setup for libs
_ library installation should use the sketchbook folder, not the p5 folder
_   actually enforce this, give users a warning about other libs
_ need to deal with classpath conflicts
_   avoid garbage that people have installed on their machines
_   antlr.jar in the classpath will cause trouble.. 
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1138652326
_   jogl jar files, or jogl install will cause trouble
_     /System/Library/Java/Extensions or /Library/Java/Extensions
_     the /System one contains qtjava
_     the /Library one is empty (by default), maybe skip it?
_ when a conflicting library is found, need to report it
_   altho prolly only when it's actually different (md5hash it?)
_   this seems to be causing a lot of trouble with recent releases
_   (opengl changes and whatnot)
_ jar files like the bad aiexport plugin will cause serious problems
_   need to ignore processing.core classes showing up in other jar files
_   tougher than it looks, because it all depends on what java wants to use
_     i.e. even if not specified, the stuff will be in the classpath
_   need to make classpath code be less promiscuous
_   the order of adding libraries to classpath should be opposite
_     the important local libraries should be first in cp, user contrib later
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=321
_ java.extension.dirs has the library/extn stuff
_   can probably set this blank
_ the jar from which a class file has been loaded
_   getClass().getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getFile() 
_ example from jsyn
JSyn Installer build 011

Installation completed.
_ set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to include .dylib and other framework stuff
_   java.library.path will only handle .jnilib stuff
_ need better error messages for broken api / library troubles
_   e.g. ocd is broken in 0125 because of method signature changes
_ could have library developers update compatability note
_   so they would need to test library and say "compatible with 0110"
_   before it would automatically update or show as an update
_ tools -> get library
_   library url: [ http://blahblah.org/something ]
_   this would grab something.version, and something.zip
_   maybe something.xml that would include a bunch of background
_ tools -> update libraries
_   this would check the something.version to see if it's newer
_ document how to add libraries: put in sketchbook (not libraries folder)
_ library/download.url and library/home.url
_ if there's a reference subfolder, add that to the help menu
o   and enable it for "find in reference"
X   nice idea but too error-prone

DOC / Write Me

_ PDE locks up during setup() (since no window shown)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=687
_   maybe better to do an example of running code on another thread
_   when it's done as a script
_ stop() to shut down a sketch (but not quit/close window)
_ MIN_FLOAT, MAX_FLOAT, also the difference from the Java functions
_   also MIN_INT and MAX_INT, even though those are more similar
_ update the reference to cover parseXxxx() stuff
_   also add notes about parseInt/Float(blah, otherwise)
_ also parseInt and parseFloat, how they can return another number or NaN
_   should the default be NaN or 0?
_ get/set are faster way draw screen space images, but no tint, no translations
_ make sure the docs include "beginShape() cannot be nested"
_   also add error messages to the renderers
_   also note that ellipse() et al use beginShape()
_   and that java2d should complain if people try it
_ method to go from function name to the included examples where used?
_ encourage use of set() instead of point() in the drawing api
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1114204116
_ moviemaker video sizes / usability
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Exhibition;action=display;num=1211318862
_ other projects on which p5 is built 
_   no longer oro matcher and jikes
_   add: quaqua, jna, registry stuff, .. ?
_ quicktime likes to crash (not just on windows)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=791
_ noLoop() isn't the same as "finished", though it's sometimes used that way
_   to finish, use exit() (though that will make the window close)
_   add this to ref once halt() is finished
_ errors in pdf/index.html examples
_   probably remove these, move the useful ones to the examples folder
_   that way people will read the reference
_ i can't fix these:
An unexpected error has been detected by HotSpot Virtual Machine:
# EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION
all i can do is find things that might trigger them, but it's more likely
than not to be a java problem, and not something that can be fixed
_ notes about getting best results from text in each renderer
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=466
_ add to mac reference for present mode
_   can make full screen work via Info.plist key
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1135921427;start=7#7
_ add to troubleshooting
_   problem with big floats:
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1061302380
_   problem with small floats:
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Programs;action=display;num=1115500448
_ fix syntax highlighting of focusGained and others
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=659
_ verify (and document) public access members of PApplet
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=660
_ some docs missing (therefore not syntax highlighting)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=661
_ constants that are not highlighting (WINDOWS the only one?)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=662
_ consoleXxxx and untitledXxxx folders in /tmp
_   console may be useful for debugging
_ untitled folders are stored in temp folder
_ switching into present mode in info.plist
        <key>LSUIPresentationMode</key>
        <integer>4</integer> 
_ PApplet.this doesn't work
_   doesn't work in javac either--needs to be ClassName.this
_   sketchname.this also doesn't work, because Temporary_NNNN used for name
_   but since it's another tab/class, will run externally
_   so should make the external version use the actual sketch name not temp
_   can't use PApplet.this, doesn't seem to like that
_   instead, must pass variable to inner class
_ errors with serial and libraries
Exception in thread "Thread-2" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
processing/core/PApplet
    at processing.serial.Serial.<init>(Serial.java:156) 
generally, that error means that something is missing from the
CLASSPATH. the NoClassDefError gives erroneous feedback about *what*
class is actually missing, as of java 1.3+ (yay!)
so perhaps conflicting versions of a library in the sketchbook (solve
this by setting to an empty sketchbook temporarily) or files might be
installed in the CLASSPATH variable or something conflicting in
/System/Library/Extensions. 


DOC / Text

_ how to use textMode(SHAPE) with opengl
_   things will be extremely slow (fix later)
_   things will also be very ugly on-screen
_ text being nicer in java2d
_   use createFont() to load the font or use a font from your machine
_   note that createFont() is no good for applets/export to web
_ textMode(SCREEN) for P2D and P3D for nice fast text in screen space
_   currently slow in JAVA2D and OPENGL, but this will improve
_ what is the vlw font file format?
_ shapes from 3D type
_   the way to do it (will improve later) is to use some undocumented features  
_   1) you have to use the OPENGL renderer 
_   2) use textMode(SHAPE); 
_   3) use createFont() (which you already are) 
_   this will convert all the shape data from the fonts for writing. 
_   it will be *extremely* slow, which is part of why it's not documented yet. 
_   but it will work with beginRaw().


DOC / Discourse Board

_ auto-close threads when not posted to for 30(?) days
_ add basic guidelines for posting to the board
_   0. be polite. going on about how much something "sucks" or is "stupid" will make you look like an eight-year-old.
_   1. don't double (or triple) post
_   2. if you're having trouble, first see the troubleshooting page
_   3. if you have a bug, first search the bugs database
_   4. first check the FAQ
_   5. use the search bar at the top of every page
_   6. read revisions.txt
_ someone wrote up an initial version of this
_ how to put [code] around blocks of code
_   also mention contributed plugin for formatting
_   also the reference page on the bb commands
_ i don't answer to instant messages
_ i don't answer email
_ use the bugs db instead of the bugs board
_ use the search box (not the forum search)
_ read the faq, read the faq
_ read the reference.. right-click on a word and choose "find in ref"
_ non-processing posts will be deleted (not a java discussion board)
_ no duplicate posts - find an area and post to
_ explanation of what the areas are
_ be sure to look at the reference, especially the extended reference
_   questions like 'how do i do x' are often solved by looking at the api
_   for instance, to get the framerate, use framerate()

PDE - Processing Development Environment


PDE / Warnings

_ proper dialog support
_   http://javagraphics.blogspot.com/2008/06/joptionpane-making-alternative.html
_ two-tiered dialogs for everything - use big font/little font style throughout
_ option to suppress warning dialogs
_   starting with the one about modifying the sketch name for spaces
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3
_ the first time someone hides a tab, put up a msg explaining what it does
_   "don't warn me about this anymore"
_ add "don't warn me about this" for sketch renaming
_   make sure renamed version doesn't exist already
_ prompt user before nuking applet or application folders
_   along with a "don't ask me later"
_ include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_   or rename the old applet folder to something else? (too messy)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=61


PDE / Compiler & Preprocessor

_ add local variables to PdeRecognizer
_   remove static methods in PdePreprocessor, instead pull things from recog
_ need better error messages in general
_   some means to link out to further documentation (e.g. AIOOBE, NPE)
_ add support for multiple errors from the compiler
_   actual error may be 4th of 5
_   maybe a dropdown list thing, with the first just shown?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=58
_ with additional .pde files, don't allow static mode in front tab
_ don't allow "for (blah; blah; blah) ;"
_   or if (blah blah blah) ;
_   it's never useful. students can use { } if they want an empty block
_ Update ANTLR grammar to support 1.5 syntax

_ casting problems in the parser
_   straighten out int() -> toInt() conversions
_   float u = float(x)/width; works.

_ move all prompts to modal dialog showError/Message/Warning/Prompt
_   nicely design dialog boxes to go with visual of p5

_   also need a "prompt" dialog for asking filenames, etc
_   implement and remove PdeEditorStatus stuff
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=59


PDE / Export

1 _ replace applet.html and applet-opengl.html
1 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1057
1 _   update applet.html to point at java 6u10 with the new auto-update stuff
1 _   also update applet on the home page to do the same
4 _ failed export still copies random files
4 _   Failed compile on Export or Export to Application 
4 _   still creates folder and leaves mess behind
4 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1050
_ when exporting to application (or applet) don't copy .java files from folder
_   (they'll be copied as source files later)
_   make .java files and friends go to correct locations on export (app)
_ warn on export when people call their sketches things like Server
_ warn if someone extends PApplet but mis-names the sketch
_   or don't allow it to be exported
_   add bug reference to the faq once added to the db
X   or at least add a note about this to the faq
_ show error when no main() is included but class extends PApplet
_   error can happen or be checked 
_ errors during export don't show up properly (no red status bar)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=194
_ need to decide how to handle "stop" button in present mode
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=63
_   when running externally, people need to write their own stop function
_   just get export to application working so this can be supported
_   for now, they're stuck w/ running in the env and getting the ugliness
_ make export put a timestamp in the html code (hidden or visible)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=66
_ exporting application copies .java files 
_   .java files are copied to the root folder as well as the source folder
_ javadoc comment in a static mode app doesn't get moved to the top

PDE / Find & Replace

_ all around very ugly, fix it up
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=67
_ several tweaks
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=68
_   only enable "find next" in menu after a find has happened
_ allowing to find & replace over multiple tabs 
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=69


PDE / History

_ implement new version of history
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71
_   make history folder, and a zip (not gz) file for each entry
_   history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_     could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_     along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_     no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_     checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_     history converter option?
_   only first 20 entries visible?
_   shortcut to walk through history, ala photoshop (ctrl-alt-z)
_   zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)
_   make hooks to history api so others can write tools around it


PDE / Preferences

_ prefs window doesn't swap ok/cancel properly for mac vs. windows/linux
_   don't bother having a "cancel" for the prefs window
_ rewrite preferences window to use proper layout?
_   is there already a bug for this?
_ make prefs dialog modal?
_ prefs window not visible on windows taskbar
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=438
_ split Preferences and PreferencesFrame?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74
_ preferences window has been hit with the ugly stick
_   redo panel to use proper Box layout etc
_   also needs to look good across all platforms
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=73
_ make available the background colors for present mode, stop button color
_   isolate color chooser into a simpler/smaller class outside tools
_   then can also use from inside processing applications as well
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=75
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1130781367;start=2#2
_ add ability to set the display where present mode makes things start
_   code is already in, need to add window and test with multi-monitor setup
_   some code already written in PresentMode.java
_ option in preferences to set the jvm used to run? (osx only?)
_   this would take care of nasty macosx 1.4 vs 1.5 issues
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.3.1/Commands/java
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.2/Commands/java
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Commands/java
_   canonical path for 
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK
_   will return 1.5.0 (or maybe 1.6 for others?)


PDE / Runner 

_ draw mode apps do not shut off the run button when finished
_   need to talk to VM and read when 'finished' var is set
_ does closing the window call stop()?
_   need to make sure hitting stop button and closing window explicitly call
_   set finished to true, then join() the animation thread
_ stop() not working very well 
_   as a result, dispose() methods aren't being called on libraries
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=77
_ quitting from present mode doesn't kill run button
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80
X when running externally, set window frame title to the sketch name
X   is this only a problem on macosx? 
_ need to set dock icon title on osx


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ don't reload sketch on "save as"
_   this can result in loss of data (undo is lost)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433
_ ArticulatePrint-070103a.pde from ArticulatePrint-070103a loads ok
_   but when opening the sketch, it leaves out the file
_   because there's a dash in the name
_   and instead only loads StemCell.pde
_ show progress dialog during export and save
_ slow save/new because of large sketchbook
_   this is a total cluster, the rebuild is being called incessantly
_   startup is very slow on g4
_   show progress bar while rebuilding sketch menu?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1162801212
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1141126582
_   even more of a problem becase set modified set true all the time
_   in 0125, only rebuilding on rename or save as, but still a problem
_   don't re-scan all jar files whenever rebuilding sketch menu (cache)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=579
_ in rebuild sketch menu - disable subfolders working as libraries
_   if a sketch, don't allow subfolders
o   or maybe just that libraries must be in the root? 
o   nah, cuz that would mean can't make subfolder called "libraries"
_ is the 'hide' option for code dumb? i've never used it
_   should it just hide the code, not actually remove it?
_ do we finish the tabs thing for 1.0? yes
_   could probably be done in a reasonable simple way.. ala eclipse
_   show additional tabs in the dropdown list? show all?
_ robert's tunnel example, why does tunnel not show up as leftmost tab?
_ hitting ESC on "create this, move file, continue" opened anyway
_ may need a progress bar for "save as"
_   or just the file copy function in general
_   since it may take a long time (i.e. 1000s of screen grabs)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=82
_ "save as" shouldn't always show save as dialog
_   unless that's the current mode that's being used
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=83
_ handle renaming with case changes (currently ignores case change)
_   see notes/bitching in Sketch.nameCode()
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=85
_ setting sketchbook to a folder on a network mounted drive
_   does this work? test on both on mac and pc.. 
_   or if not, should recommend people against it 
_   (i.e. folders disappearing if net has trouble)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=87
_ some type of sketch archive format for posting examples (.psk?)
_   would be nice to open a sketch directly from a zip file
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=88
_   maybe just open from a zip file, since psk doesn't help anything
_   also have a means of importing sketches

_ archive sketch direct to bug report
_ courseware
_   export sketch as applet when uploading
_   save sketch zip files
_   have a means to load them from "teacher" version of p5

TOOLS / Create Font

_ loading is very slow on the first time (getting all font names)
_   create the tool object on startup, then use thread to getAllFonts()
_   show a progress/status bar while it's happening?
_   (would be useful to at least tell user that system not locked up)
_ create font with user-specified charsets
_   may help solve: http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=98
_ when resizing window, only resize the text display area
_   just a matter of moving around the panels and BorderLayout

_   only supports tint() (to set alpha or color) and drawing? just drawing?
_ stop button won't kill a video sketch (bug 150 example does this) 
X   although ESC seems to work? (not sure, didn't test)
_   or audio won't stop even after hitting stop
_ when an exception comes through during cameraEvent, not printed
_   need to show an actual stack trace (InvocationTargetEx) 
_   because otherwise it's impossible to debug this stuff


LIBRARIES / XML

_ handle charset decoding in xml element parser?
_   same with the other methods like loadStrings()
_   could also be a way to handle gzip too?
_   tho charset + gzip would be a problem
_ need to handle how save() works inside xml lib
_ need to handle <!ENTITY tags for svg documents
_ vectors shouldn't be exposed, need to expose attr lists as arrays
_   or also add a method for getting the vectors?


LIBRARIES / Serial

_ syslog issues on macosx
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1147
_ port buffering not working properly
_   may just be a problem with thread starvation
_   bufferUntil() fires an event but continues to fill up the buffer
_   bug report includes patch from mellis
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=96
_ add prompt() method to Serial (simple dialog box that pops up)
E4 _ Add Mark and Space parity to the Serial library

DIST

How the environment gets packed up, downloaded, and installed.


DIST / General 

_ use macosx dialogs for all of the editor stuff
_   see about doing the same on windows, linux?
_   the others seem to respond ok to the lucida grande since they use defaults
_   vista style dialogs
_     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb328626.aspx
_   confirmation dialogs (save and don't save.. who'd a thunk it)
_     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511273.aspx
_     http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/Aa511273.Confirmations03(en-us,MSDN.10).png
_   scrollable stack trace
_     http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t19012.html
_ shut off javac warnings
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=812
_ use pack200/unpack200 to make p5 download smaller
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=765
_ drag and drop
_   including the number of items would be especially nice
_ implement automatic update
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=374
_ move build scripts to something better like ant
_   too much to maintain the multiple versions, too much code
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=151
_   also update build/howto.txt (of course) because it says no ant
_ need .pde document icons
_ need .psk file icon
_ need exported application icons
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known bugs'
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known suggestions'
_ javadoc "advanced" reference by beta
_   and then finalizing it towards 1.0
_ write notes about running p5 on another platforms 
_   this was some feedback from running on bsd:
_     /usr/local/jdk1.3.1/bin/java -cp lib:lib/build:lib/pde.jar:lib/kjc.jar:lib/oro.jar:java/lib/ext/comm.jar PdeBase 
_   need to use the 1.3 vm, and get a fake platform name
_   otherwise, goes looking for lib/pde_.properties or something
o modify antlr stuff to conditionally recompile in make.sh
_   compile antlr inside the initial setup of the work dir
X     done for macosx
_     fix this for windows and linux
_ about box 
_   bring up information about gpl, lgpl, and ibmpl
_   jedit syntax is under mit license
_     http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
_ different name for 'lib' folder because of libraries folder?
_   avoid some confusion for when describing the libraries folder to users
_ remove jvm from cvs
_   use wget to grab it if it doesn't exist
_   and include an md5hash to see if the file is correct


DIST / Windows

2 _ Windows problem with some lab machines "Processing cannot run because 
2 _   it could not create a folder to store your settings"
2 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1016
_ check to see whether this bug is fixed once 0140 is released
_   properly handle non-ascii chars in p5 folder name
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49
_   (could also just warn user to install elsewhere)
o   perhaps the get around this by building into sketch folder
o     when non-ascii chars in use, just launch everything externally
_ icon is skewed on vista 64
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=801
_ "Fatal exception occurred. Program will exit." on startup
_   seems to be font related, deleting prefs will fix it
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=688
_ Processing IDE icon ALT + Tab low res in Windows XP
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1040


DIST / Mac OS X

_ setup() and draw() are not bold on osx (10.4)
_   likely osx refuses to do monaco bold
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1047
_ if someone has monaco disabled in font book, the app won't start
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=562
_ we're breaking some mac human interface guidelines
_   should be using a menu factory to create menubar for all sub-windows
_   http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2042.html
_   and the general warning dialogs are just ass ugly
_   (i.e. we really need those replacements for JOptionPane)
_ track down error in PdeCompiler for message parsing
_   was missing the error about a package being gone
_   can comment out /System/Library/ as a test
_ put stdout/stderr into ~/Library/Logs
_   and have a .log extension so it can be browsed properly
_ try LSMinimumSystemVersion in Info.plist
5 _ Horizontal two finger scroll doesn't work in OS X
5 _   also applies to horizontal scrolling on the mouse
5 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1046
5 _ Exiting a sketch with Command-Q or File > Quit doesn't call stop() on OS X
5 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1069


DIST / Linux

_ finish up debian package support (see the processing.mess folder)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=596
_   these bits need to be checked to ensure that they work on other distros
_ Editor stops receiving keyboard input after running a program
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1161
_ not being able to make a link to the processing app
_   argh.. more path and shell issues..
_ computationally intensive stuff runs really slow inside p5
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1116872745
_ some reports of it not quitting properly, but not confirmed
_ splash screen
_ can't launch from a symlink in /usr/bin
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=825


LATER

_ rename location is awkward, do it on the tab?
_ method of including/excluding data files in the JAR
_   or at least a boolean for the whole folder?
_ should open() not return a Process object? (exec() instead?)
_   pro: can write out error messages (or output)
_   con: loses cross platform ability
_   but: open() is platform specific anyway, ppl can use exec()
