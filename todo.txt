0070 pde
o don't allow editing of multiple files in this release
o   but support multiple java/pde files through the 'add file' option
o check in licenses/dist stuff for jikes etc
o who has the copyright? (mit does)
o SystemColor doesn't differentiate between menu background and top
o   probably fixed in swing, but we're using java.awt.Menu
o   test by rewriting with java.awt.Menu
X beautify is ignoring the setting for number of spaces on tabs
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083708360;start=0
X clean up PdeTokenMarker, probably just alphabetize
X saving issues (all the same bug, as it turns out)
X   save changes to null
X   sketch is changing before the "save changes?" is complete
X     as a result, 'cancel' does nothing
X   always ask save changes, even if nothing changed

040620 sunday 
X remove 'sketchbook.prompt' (comment it out)
X   not really needed
X   remove prompt stuff from the preferences panel
X clean up the "more options" in prefs panel 
X   to use JLabel instead of JTextArea
X   font was wrong on windows
X start working on "save as"

040621 monday morning
X finish "save as"
X adding files to data folder that are already in the data folder
X   makes the file zero, because of internal error
X   added something to check to make sure they weren't the same
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1076358515
X implement read-only sketch folder
X   examples are sort of there but need to be debugged
X   read-only files should be checked
X check if file is read-only, and if so, ask where to put sketch
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1075149564;start=0
X how to handle examples: read only, somewhere inside lib
X move examples to folder that goes w/ p5 app
X   set examples somehow read-only
X 'save as' from examples puts into examples dir.. :(
X   make it default to the user's sketch dir

040621 monday mid-day
X see if changing the sketchbook location actually works
X   after changing sketchbook location, need to rebuild the menu
X hide the editor window while prefs is open
X   this way the prefs can be properly applied

mostly notes from things that have been fixed along the way:
X fix code for changing the sketch folder
X   'new sketch' goes into the wrong folder
X   but saving and all that works properly
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083184449;start=0
X sketch.properties should go into user.home
X   otherwise moving sketch folder will kill it
X   last-used sketch not being saved
X if sketchbook.dir is set, makes new sketchbook folder
X   reads sketchbook properly from other folder
X   but creates a new folder for new sketches to go into
X sketchbook.dir not properly read or written
X install sketchbook into another location on person's machine
X   use System.getProperty("user.home"); 
X   remove the 'default' for sketchbook
X   bring this up on bboard and get votes
X   win2k: my documents, macosx: ~/Documents, linux: ~/sketchbook
X open mode
X   on application open, override 'open' mode
X   and just open an empty sketch in the sketchbook folder
X when 'skNew' is cancelled in 'open' mode, nullpointerex at the top

040621 monday afternoon
X if a "save as" is forced, make sure that the sketchbook menu is updated
X sort sketch names in the open menu
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1074981609
X code folder was causing mega-crashes
X rewrite magic import methods to only use packages where classes found
X   was adding all folders in the classpath
X workaround for the // causing an OutOfMemoryError
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1067717095

040621 monday evening/night
X jikes errors have no newlines because it's a buffered reader
X   and the newlines are removed when read
X make the filedialog come up with the p5 window on handlenew
X   sets the parent frame to the PdeEditor
X find() hangs on replacing "println" with "//println"
X   "replace all" should start at the beginning of the buffer, move to end
X     after replace all, caret moves to end of document

X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1083093129
X after using sketchbook menu as popup, disappears from file menu
X   probably just need to build two
X   the popup from the toolbar needs an "Open..." on it as well
X make save() return true/false so it doesn't say "saved" when it hasn't
X export is badly broken, fix it.. file names were backwards
X if 'applet.html' is in sketch folder, use that as the template
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1083935144

X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1074240197;start=0
X get the console working again
X   appendText is disabled due to NullPointerEx on startup
X empty the console when a new sketch is opened
X   if console.auto_clear is set to true, will clear on run and open
X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1086972918
X maybe bring back the prompt option for "new sketch"
X   sometimes nice just to have it create an unnamed sketch quickly
X   shift-new will always prompt with filedialog
X dashes shouldn't be allowed in filenames for sketches
X   actually, lost the naming stuff because now using FileDialog
X   this also needs to be checked when building the sketch menu 
X rewrite sketchbook.clean()
X   prompt user if they don't have it set to auto
X   add a pref to the preferences window

040622 monday late night
X set handleOpen to use editor as its parent frame
X what happens when the .pde file isn't named 
X   the same as the enclosing folder?
X   maybe put up a window saying no way, and ask:
X   ( ) rename enclosing or ( ) add a subfolder
X   or maybe even ( ) rename the sketch file
X   also double-check to see if there *is* a proper pde in the folder
X     in which case, default to that (maybe show a message?)
X   it's useful to have loose .pde files be runnable..
X   i.e. when double-clicking on them.. downloaded off web.. 
X     but need to deal with simply, not providing a new exception case
X begin writing 'new text file'

040622 tuesday morning / early afternoon
X write 'new text file' (ctrl-t)
X hitting return/enter on the status.edit() not always working
X   it had been disabled, now re-enabled
X also update status after "add file" of a .pde or .java
X implement delete
X implement hide/unhide
X see if multiple files are actually compiling
X   nope, they aren't properly.. need to figure this out
X   empty files = no class name found.. that's a problem

040623 wednesday afternoon
X continue work on multi-file compile
X test that .java files can be created
X   allow user to type a period '.' when entering filename
X   but remove it again if it's not .pde or .java
X clean up error handling for empty files (quiet error)
X preproc messages don't say the file

040706 discuss with casey
X how should history be handled
X   per-sketch, not per-file
X   just looks like old history setup anyways
X is the sketch folder something that is never seen by the user?
X   i.e. flash programs 'import' all data, etc
X   same with how imovie works
X   no, not for 1.0
o jikes is exporting column as well.. use it?
o   3:23:3:25 -> line 3, col 23 to 25
o   decided a bad idea, too difficult
X don't bother with 'advanced' on export dialog
X   that can come later, if needed
X how to handle .pde vs .java
X   how to determine what the 'main' file is
X   sun won't want us to say things are .java when they aren't
X .pde files opened on their own
X what should the prefs file be named?
X horizontal buttons? need final decision [yes]
X remove underscores from the tab title?
X   nope, casey says not necessary
X need nice yes/no dialog boxes, also 
o does "Open" go at the beginning or end of the sketch popup
X we need opengl support in there
X   otherwise we're going to be stuck behind director
X   go with sun's jogl project
X core.jar included with .class? or make one jar?
X libraries and package naming for core & serial etc
X vec3f, matrix4f classes.. our own or java3d?

040706 first day with creas
X runtime errors not making it through
X   now properly handling multiple files
X also test with multiple files / external run
X   oh wait, this is only for external run.. duh
o jikes messages are getting lost (?)
o ctrl-t doesn't always work
o   after using the popup menu once, it stops working
X jikes errors are missing newline/linefeed ?
o using run-expert.bat on 62 causes NullPointerException weirdness (?)

040707 wednesday morning and early afternoon
X bring this up for discussion on the board
X   will splitting actually help.. can jars come from multiple places?
X spend a bunch of time tracking down more issues on the board
X add .java to file name in the tab
X change name of prefs to Processing Preferences.txt
X implement clone for BImage
X api name changes for imaging functions
X   constant SUBSTRACT -> SUBTRACT 

040707 afternoon
X minor bug with when setting sketchbook to a bad location
X add export back to the file menu
X long discussion about how to put things together
X working on debugging thread weirdness on casey's machine

040707 night
X change "add file" to import
X change "new" to "new file"
X CENTER instead of CENTER_DIAMETER
o make CENTER default for ellipses
X move imageMode() to BImage
X put bagel into its own package
X   processing.core -> PApplet, PGraphics, PLine, PTriangle, PPolygon
X rename replicate() as copy()
X what is set(x, y, image) -> remove it, make a copy() instead
X modify image functions to use imageMode

040707 late
X lots more work on make.sh for both mac and pc
X further tweaking of the new class structure
X trying to get the build scripts wrapped up/working
X remove more (all?) ifdefs from code base

040708 morning / early afternoon
X more work on ifdef removal / build scripts
X ask creas about src or dest in image functions
X finish imaging api
X modify make.sh to build processing.core

040708 afternoon / early evening
X lots of work on making packaged classes work
X modify preproc to handle "void setup" -> "public void setup"
o preproc bug: text(String.valueOf(i+1), left + i*20, top);
o   unexpected token "String"
X make more things public (i.e. pixels)
X get casting working properly.. int() maps to toInt()? 
X   what is performance hit for this thing?
X remove substitute_image/font
X remove String casting
X rename compiler.* to preproc.*
X OutOfMemoryError still showing up when no CR at end of app

notes for release
_ processing won't start..
_   people with non-ascii chars in the folder name 
_     at least try to catch this?
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1062794781;start=0
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1067764732
_   or with spaces in the folder name, causes problems for serial
_ quicktime full uninstall/reinstall
_ code folder problems
_ hm, lots of other bugs from this list..
_ update readme with notes from bboard about "built with processing"

_ run java mode when large 'data' folder is in use
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081542378


LIBRARIES
_ "add library" menu item and submenu
_   iterate through the 'library' folders
_ dll and jnilib files have to be in the p5 folder (confirmed by amit)
_   there should be other places that they work.. 
_   could even copy the dll to the p5 folder from the code folder
_ simong: request a preloop and postloop call for libraries
_   this would avoid having to patch BApplet
_ libraries: static and non-static init for libs
_   final stop() for static shutdown of lib
_   but also potential stop() for individual items


BUGS / preproc
_ casting problems in the parser
_   float u = float(x)/width; works.
_   float u = (float(x)/width); doesn't work: "unexpected token: float".
_   float u = (x/float(width)); works! 
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1084011098;start=0
_ if last line of code is a comment with no CR after it,
_   an OutOfMemoryError wants to happen, 
_   but right now there's a hack to add a CR in PdePreprocessor


BUGS / Windows
_ p5's exe prolly has trouble when PATH has quotes (or spaces?)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1068388889
_   CLASSPATH figured out what to do with quotes, but not PATH
_ problems running external vm/vm is hanging
_   seems to be happening because of virus scanning software (norton)
_   may need to launch the applet (using 'start') 
_     and talk over a socket instead
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1067867520;start=0
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1067643186
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1078714442;start=0
_     something in that one about mouse position halting or not
_ ctrl-5 (at least on xp) is marking the current sketch as modified


BUGS / Linux
_ doesn't seem interested in quitting properly (?)


CONSOLE
_ error messages run off the edge and go invisible
_   actually this is just for the editor status box
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1074894329
_ console -> should be using JEditTextArea not TextPane
_ make new TextAreaDefaults class for the console
_ figure out how to color lines for errors and non (since not syntax)
_ set decent fonts (probably same as editor above), looks bad on mac


MEDIUM
_ network/shared_canvas, network/value has old code
_ write script to remove .DS_Store and CVS folders from dist
_   # remove DS_Store files
_   sudo find . -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \;
_ change run.bat, run-expert.bat to use 128m
_ ability to include other .java and .pde code from sketchbook folder
_   'add files' for .java or .pde pulls into the folder
_ better 1.3/1.4 support.. properly detect vm
_   use when deciding which classes to import
_ better support for running locally
_   code to read from properties file from param()
_     for application mode or while inside the environment
_     these properties will be written to html on export
_   fix link, loadStrings, saveBytes code once that's fixed
_   saveBytes not in proper dir is annoying
_ multi-line errors a mess in jikes
_   maybe a dropdown list thing, with the first just shown?
_ processing.exe: problem if expert version is run, and no java installed
_   call the person a genius and tell them to install java


application export
_ ability to export 'applications' (not just applets)
_   lock feature for present mode (part of export to application?)
_   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
_   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
_   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
_   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works
_   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
_   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
_     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
_   also make sure pack() is happening
_   add manifest.mf to exported applets so that applications will work
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1045983103;start=0
_   BApplet.main(new String[] { "flashcards3" });
_     this will need to detect whether the user has their own main()
_     or even BApplet.main(new String[] { getClass().getName() });
_     META-INF/MANIFEST.MF contains just "Main-Class: ClassName"
_     main sticking point will be serial/qtjava in exports


history
_ history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_   could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_   along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_   no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_   checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_   history converter option?
_ only first 20 entries visible?
_ get code from revisionist in there
_ zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1080346981;start=0

licensing
_ about box 
_   bring up information about gpl, lgpl, and ibmpl
_ jedit syntax is under mit license
_   http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
_   although jedit is under gpl, if we switch to its syntax pkg
_     more info about use is in package.html

VOLUNTEER TASKS

..................................................................


TABLED FOR LATER (qasey's quagmires)
_ completeness of toInt/toFloat/toBoolean etc in preproc and PApplet


LOWER (post beta tweaks, non-structural)
1 _ Ctrl-Z will undo, but the window will not scroll to where the 
1 _   "undoing" is happening. This can lead the user to assume that
1 _   actually nothing is happening and overundo. 
1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064220242;start=0

1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1064732330;start=0

_ include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_   or rename the old applet folder to something else?
_ don't allow apostrophe (i.e. casey's_cells) when naming sketch!
_ need to change all the copyrights over to mit "except where noted"
X when exporting applet, line numbers will be off.. 
_   when not exporting with new preproc code, imports all on same line

_ fix the problem causing all the "couldn't delete" messages
_ class naming from dan
_   If you name a class the same name as the sketch project, 
_   you get an error about contained classes with duplicate names 
_   when you try to export for web.
_ if (loop == false) and (draw == false) then provide an error
_   so user knows that one or the other is needed
_ make PdeEditorStatus modal
_   problem on quit (using JOptionPane as a band-aid)
_   also a problem because user can use the ui while prompt is visible
_   needs proper blocking, the way Dialog.show() does
_   so that that status window can be used while quitting
_   (currently cannot because it quits before getting response)
_   tried to pop up a modal Dialog in exactly the same location
_     but couldn't remove the decoration from the window (jvm bug?)
_     because it just quit without finishing
_ macosx handleQuit forces termination (at least on 1.3)
_   figure out how to prevent it, and add the 'cancel' button back
_ drag & drop implementation to add files to sketch

   1 _ verify editor buttons working properly
   1 _   they're not.. mostly unresponsive, and often get stuck
   1 _   is play button properly unhighlighting? 
   1 _     does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
   1 _     also when using draw() instead of loop()
   1 _       applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
   1 _   if export fails (compile error) need deselect
   1 _ only copy data files into build dir when there are changes
   1 _   make sure the still relevant files aren't removed
   1 _   setLastModified on the files after copying (jdk13)
   1 _ better handling of AccessControlException in applets
   1 _   on loadImage and loadStream
   1 _ exceptions in draw() apps aren't caught
   1 _   the program resize(200, 200); just does nothing (doesn't complain)
   1 _ if 'void' left out before loop or setup, cryptic message about
   1 _   'constructor loop must be named Temporary_23498_2343'
   1 _   add a better handler for this specific thing?
   1 _ sketches can't be named starting with numbers (D.YOO)
   1 _   either provide an error message or explanation for this
   1 _   or allow the sketch name to be separte from the class/folder names

   1 _ some method to store a description of a sketch in its comments
   1 _   then embed that into the html page
   1 _ don't cache stuff from loadStrings and others
   1 _   mac java vm won't give up old version of file

   1 _   option to ignore or match case
   1 _   when hitting 'find', select the text in the field
   1 _     give that field focus explicitly, rather than just for typing
   1 _     right now, typing works, but no caret, no blue highlight
   1 _     and on second find run, should instead select all the find string
   1 _       so that typing will replace it directly

DISTRIBUTION

How the environment gets packed up, downloaded, and installed.


DISTRIBUTION / General 
b _ need more comprehensive list of 'known bugs'
b _ need more comprehensive list of 'known suggestions'
b _ beta release will include source code
b _ write notes about running p5 on another platforms 
b _   this was some feedback from running on bsd:
b _   /usr/local/jdk1.3.1/bin/java -cp lib:lib/build:lib/pde.jar:lib/kjc.jar:lib/oro.jar:java/lib/ext/comm.jar PdeBase 
b _   need to use the 1.3 vm, and get a fake platform name
b _   otherwise, goes looking for lib/pde_.properties or something
1 _ if size() not found in export/compile, ask the user
1 _   size(myWidth, myHeight) -> set static var in BGraphics
1 _     for the last size that was used, use as default for fill-in field
1 o modify antlr stuff to conditionally recompile in make.sh
1 _   compile antlr inside the initial setup of the work dir
1 X     done for macosx
1 _     fix this for windows and linux


DISTRIBUTION / Windows
1 _ don't force install of qtjava
1 _   this requires a separate version of bagel that doesn't use video
1 _   or a version that loads video dynamically. that kinda sucks.
1 _   maybe could even compile it in with jikes? (blech)
1 _ winamp/audio getting starved or crackly while applets running
1 _   thread priority too high? or something weird
1 _ need splash screen, startup takes a long time
1 _ tie .pde files as documents of the application
1 _   figure out proper registry key for windows
1 _     can be handled when the app first run (jni?)
1 _   write handler for main() to take document names
1 _   need document icons
1 _   add MRJOpenApplicationHandler and MRJOpenDocumentHandler
1 _       especially the open document fella
1 _       under osx, app won't get doc unless app already launched


DISTRIBUTION / Linux
b _ splash screen
1 _ ctrl-t is not stopping a sketch
1 _   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1074810469


DISTRIBUTION / Mac OS X
1 _ move the mac to java 1.4
1 _   1.4 is being used externally, and wheel mouse would be nice
1 _   not doing currently, lots of strange repaint bugs
1 _     all fixable for sure, but no point before beta since low priority
b _ set nice background for disk image on macosx
1 _ random lockups seem common in 1.4
1 _ test more to see if runtime exceptions are coming through
1 _ track down error in PdeCompiler for message parsing
1 _   was missing the error about a package being gone
1 _   can comment out /System/Library/ as a test
1 _ Contents/Resources/Java can take jnilib files
1 _ set file type/creator for .pde files of examples
1 _ would be nice to have macosx packaged up as a single .app file
1 _ is there a way to set the color of the Frame growbox?
1 _   currently it's white instead of dark gray like the ui
1 _   setBackground(Color) didn't seem to help inside PdeBase.<init>
1 _ use disk:// notation as panther alternative
1 _   so that it doesn't download the disk, just mounts it
1 _   although.. this only works on panther.. how many are using it?

PRIORITIES


casey
_ graphics engine up to spec
_ video/net/sound up to spec
_ multiple files open 
_ compile libraries within p5

ed

juha
_ documenting how the environment works / is set up

amit
_ find/replace
_ println speed improvements
_ 'debug' that shows a variable (rather than many many println)
_ tabs for multiple files

zach
_ setting breakpoints / stepping through
_ useful as understanding for how program works
_ tracing like director

schoenerwissen
_ tracing variables

_ 7 day search on discourse board


..................................................................


api work

ugly but no ideas yet
_ serialWrite -> sprint ? 
_ noSmooth
_ noFill()
_ rectMode means rectPlacement
_   becomes a problem when strokeMode and strokeWidth are mixed
_ beginRect() beginLineLoop() et al. ?

_ begin/end.. beginSerial/endSerial -> 
_   openSerial/closeSerial ?
_   startSerial/stopSerial
_ need some model for i/o that makes more sense
_   getting whole words from serial, network, and files
_   or buffers of specific length with a sync byte
_ split to take strings (ie. for ", ")
_ quicksort should probably just be made into 'sort' class
_   it's the only one ever used
_   can this be done using an inner class?

_ should BSpace be included?
_ go through examples to see if there's other annoying syntax

_ for int i for 0 to b.length
_ for i from 0 upto b.length

additions that i want
_ image(BImage, x, y, float scale) (found in illustrator stuff)
_ textrect(String text, x, y, width, height)  // based on rectMode
_   textMode() for align left, center, right (no justify.. har!)
_ file i/o: file listing util that leaves out . and ..
_ rotateRight(), rotateLeft(), flipHorizontal().. etc
_   for an actual 'transformations' object
_ write tiff (or other) header for image stream
_   make a class/library for this guy
_ actionscript has nice hastables.. as does perl/python
_   would be nice to get better implementation in there


..................................................................


// notes on an implementation of a 'shape' class..
// as long as using an additional pde file...

..to still maintain rect() instead of g.rect()
..and the rest of the p5 features

// shape or "processing" means to add all kinds of methods like:
// public void point(float x, float y) {  g.point(x, y);  }
// and that the class 'implements' ShapeInterface..
//
shape class Something {

  void setup() {
    // not used, or called on first draw

    // but maybe required (even if behind the scenes) 
    // so that this can use "implements ShapeInterface"
  }

  void draw() {  // uses internal g. that's been set by parent
  }
}


in the .pde parent:

void loop() {
  shape(somethingInstance);
}

where the shape() method in BApplet looks like:

shape(ShapeInterface o) {
  o.graphics(this.g);  // has to be a method, since intf
  o.draw();
}
