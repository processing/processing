2.0
_ colors for 2.0
_ nurbs or other arch stuff for 2.0?
_ build is currently broken for fresh checkout due to changes to file layout
_   something that gets fixed by 'make clean'

_ Internationalization
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=593

regressions
_ strange window flicker when first opened
_ test libraries on android
_ test .java files on desktop version
_ Closing sketch file closes applet
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=606

additions
_ when creating a sketch within non-java mode, should write the settings file
_   so that it re-loads in the proper environment
_ examples window sketches should load in proper environment

ugliness
_ inside AndroidPreprocessor
_   processing.mode.java.JavaBuild.scrubComments(sketch.getCode(0).getProgram())
_   PApplet.match(scrubbed, processing.mode.java.JavaBuild.SIZE_REGEX);
_ remove PdeKeyListener, roll it into the Java InputHandler for JEditTextArea
_ move Java-specific InputHandler to its own subclass
_ remove any reference to 'Editor' from Sketch.java
_   or is that excessive, since Document is in there, etc
_   Build does the heavy lifting anyway...
_ TextAreaDefaults
_   is editable in use?
_   what's electricScroll?
_   caretBlinks always true.. just remove the pref?
_   blockCaret always false.. remove it?
_ EditorToolbar, two TODO items for open menu handling

blob of mess
_ multiple sketch windows.. having a windows menu?
_   examples button on toolbar? open / recent / sketchbook?
_ modes have their own methods for digging through sketch & libraries folders
_   therefore it need only check the sketch.txt file to see if it's ok
_   (between android and java) 
_   but more importantly, if it's something totally different (.py) then
_   that'll be ok, and work fine
_   need another extension for the p5 py stuff
_ android mode will make no attempt to figure out which of your sketches are relevant... however you can add the sketch.txt file (sketch.properties?) to the directory if you want to be specific about it.
_ idea of examples, libraries, reference built into the base system
_ look through web/java_generate to see how the doc stuff works
_ work through andres' pshape changes to smooth things out
_ post videos online of the android work
_ why we can't do OpenGL applets that are self-signed (wiki?) 
_   http://www.cert.org/blogs/vuls/2008/06/signed_java_security_worse_tha.html
_ don't make examples read-only
_   just do them from psk files

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1611357/how-to-make-a-jar-file-that-include-dll-files

_ p5 assets need to be licensed differently from the source

We're making an assumption that the idea of a "library" refers to a block of Java-based code. The reasoning is that from within the PDE, we anticipate that it will be Java-compatible versions of other languages (such as Jython, JRuby, or Scala) as opposed to more generic languages. In the future we could open this up, but we'd rather not complicate things for the moment.

libraries
_ need to deal with classpath conflicts
_   avoid garbage that people have installed on their machines
_   antlr.jar in the classpath will cause trouble.. 
_     http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1138652326
_   jogl jar files, or jogl install will cause trouble
_     /System/Library/Java/Extensions or /Library/Java/Extensions
_     the /System one contains qtjava
_     the /Library one is empty (by default), maybe skip it?
_     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1259
_   another problem with opengl libraries
_     http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1570
_ when a conflicting library is found, need to report it
_   altho prolly only when it's actually different (md5hash it?)
_   this seems to be causing a lot of trouble with recent releases
_   (opengl changes and whatnot)
_ jar files like the bad aiexport plugin will cause serious problems
_   need to ignore processing.core classes showing up in other jar files
_   tougher than it looks, because it all depends on what java wants to use
_     i.e. even if not specified, the stuff will be in the classpath
_   need to make classpath code be less promiscuous
_   the order of adding libraries to classpath should be opposite
_     the important local libraries should be first in cp, user contrib later
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=321
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=56
_ changing the sketchbook folder will make libraries show up
_   but it won't reload the library mapping table
_ make sure there aren't library jar files named the same thing 
_   i.e. if one library has db.jar, then that's gonna kill another db.jar
_   when the files are copied over

_ when are prefs saved? could instead save whenever changes are made
_   and then if the file gets modified, it'll put up an error message
_   also, this may be part of why other sketches aren't reloading properly
_ add a 150 ms or more lag before opening the untitled window (on os x)
_ Editor.applyFrame() may not have a valid 'editor' object to work with
_   if windows closed, and prefs altered, NPE thrown
_ clear up prefs so that multiple editors don't trash each other's prefs
_ make sure editor isn't trying to apply prefs when no editor is open
_   (on mac os x, due to the change for no windows open)

_ how to handle double-clicked files on windows?
_   big deal for psk and others

_ Added some basic Emacs cursor navigator keybindings
_   just implement these as a preference
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=555

. . . . 


_ changing number of screens between run causes things to show up off-screen
_   so when running, check to make sure that things are out of the area
_ saved window positions.. if displays has changed, becomes a problem
_   record the display that it was on?
_     GraphicsDevice gd = frame.getGraphicsConfiguration().getDevice();
_   make sure that the application is within the bounds of the current display?
_   (from 0, 0 to width, height)
_   messy since some displays have negative coords
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=72
_   http://code.google.com/p/processing/issues/detail?id=27
Base.restoreSketches() has commented out code that checked for out of bounds windows with the preferences last.window.x and last.window.y. These prefs don't exist anymore, but it would be quick to implement it again using last.sketch<i>.location instead. It would probably result in less code, because it would mean we could get rid of the windowPositionValid stuff.

_ fix line endings in revisions.txt for windows

closing this bug, because we'll be replacing the current video library with another sometime later this year. as such, i won't be doing any more bug fixes on the current video library. in the meantime, we recommend using gsvideo, opencv, or one of the other video libraries that are available.

You can't do that from the AWT event thread. You need to do a -performSelectorOnMainThread to do that on the AppKit event thread.

[ known bugs ]

_ video library threading problems with other libraries

_   using Capture.list() before size() sometimes works
_   also placing OpenGL inside the extensions directory
_ serial.available() broken with video
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=829
_ first few frames of OpenGL sketches on Windows run slowly
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=874
_ sometimes not launching
_   this seems to be a threading problem, like an NPE on load/open
_   probaby related to the other load/save sync errors


with casey
_ specifically add "eclipse" to integration description
_ link books and sample chapters from the "getting started" portion of the faq
_ keep examples.zip in a zip file? (5000 files @ 30 MB instead of 15 MB zip)
_   mark examples as untitled (rather than read-only)
_   maybe even pull these directly from the zip file?
_ load examples from zip files
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1049
_   disallow add file to sketch, export, export application
_   pretty much anything inside the sketch?
_   but don't do this with untitled, cuz it kinda stinks
_   this is too weird--just put examples into individual zip files
_   mark example files as untitled
_   though will that require the sketch to be saved before export?
_ find in reference issues
_   if() and for() don't work, they look for for_.html instead of for.html
_   XMLElement is not linked for find in ref
_   the ? operator is not in find in ref (no ref page either?)
_ update keywords generator script on the site
_   perhaps move this closer to the dev process?
_ move reference folder around so that it matches site organization
_   otherwise several links break on the main faq page
_ discuss i18n issues and proper system (?)
_ look through 404 issues on the site
_ TRIANGLE_STRIP not highlighted for "find in reference"
_   nor is it listed on the reference page
_   so students can't find the ref for it
_   needs to link TRIANGLE_STRIP to the beginShape() reference


libraries and classpaths [1.0]
_ versioning info

_ java.ext.dirs for /System/Library/Java/Extensions
_   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html
_   can set java.ext.dirs to something else 
_   on osx, just ignore anything in /Library/Java/Extensions (but not others)?
_ native lib stuff, use native.txt in lib folder, then:
_   String osName = System.getProperty("os.name");
_   String osArch = System.getProperty("os.arch");
_ add control for dependencies (i.e. svg needs xml), needed for export
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=518
_ add "pretty menu name" to the export.txt file
_ move export.txt to xml? (nah, it's only flat information)
_ need better platform designation setup for libs
_ library installation should use the sketchbook folder, not the p5 folder
_   actually enforce this, give users a warning about other libs
_ java.extension.dirs has the library/extn stuff

Exception in thread "Thread-2" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:

generally, that error means that something is missing from the
CLASSPATH. the NoClassDefError gives erroneous feedback about *what*
class is actually missing, as of java 1.3+ (yay!)
so perhaps conflicting versions of a library in the sketchbook (solve
this by setting to an empty sketchbook temporarily) or files might be
installed in the CLASSPATH variable or something conflicting in
/System/Library/Extensions. 


DOC / Text

_ how to use textMode(SHAPE) with opengl
_   things will be extremely slow (fix later)
_   things will also be very ugly on-screen
_ text being nicer in java2d
_   use createFont() to load the font or use a font from your machine
_   note that createFont() is no good for applets/export to web
_ textMode(SCREEN) for P2D and P3D for nice fast text in screen space
_   currently slow in JAVA2D and OPENGL, but this will improve
_ what is the vlw font file format?
_ shapes from 3D type
_   the way to do it (will improve later) is to use some undocumented features  
_   1) you have to use the OPENGL renderer 
_   2) use textMode(SHAPE); 
_   3) use createFont() (which you already are) 
_   this will convert all the shape data from the fonts for writing. 
_   it will be *extremely* slow, which is part of why it's not documented yet. 
_   but it will work with beginRaw().


DOC / Discourse Board

_ auto-close threads when not posted to for 30(?) days
_ add basic guidelines for posting to the board
_   0. be polite. going on about how much something "sucks" or is "stupid" will make you look like an eight-year-old.
_   1. don't double (or triple) post
_   2. if you're having trouble, first see the troubleshooting page
_   3. if you have a bug, first search the bugs database
_   4. first check the FAQ
_   5. use the search bar at the top of every page
_   6. read revisions.txt
_ someone wrote up an initial version of this
_ how to put [code] around blocks of code
_   also mention contributed plugin for formatting
_   also the reference page on the bb commands
_ i don't answer to instant messages
_ i don't answer email
_ use the bugs db instead of the bugs board
_ use the search box (not the forum search)
_ read the faq, read the faq
_ read the reference.. right-click on a word and choose "find in ref"
_ non-processing posts will be deleted (not a java discussion board)
_ no duplicate posts - find an area and post to
_ explanation of what the areas are
_ be sure to look at the reference, especially the extended reference
_   questions like 'how do i do x' are often solved by looking at the api
_   for instance, to get the framerate, use framerate()

_ option to suppress warning dialogs
_   starting with the one about modifying the sketch name for spaces
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3
_ the first time someone hides a tab, put up a msg explaining what it does
_   "don't warn me about this anymore"
_ add "don't warn me about this" for sketch renaming
_   make sure renamed version doesn't exist already
_ prompt user before nuking applet or application folders
_   along with a "don't ask me later"

_ with additional .pde files, don't allow static mode in front tab
_   e.g. no setup()/draw() block
_ don't allow "for (blah; blah; blah) ;"
_   or if (blah blah blah) ;
_   it's never useful. students can use { } if they want an empty block
_ missing brackets, unmatched brackets
_   examples added to the bug report
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=13

low (features)
_ add support for multiple errors from the compiler
_   actual error may be 4th of 5
_   maybe a dropdown list thing, with the first just shown?
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=58
_ copy running code from /tmp/buildXXxxx on crash of p5
_   should probably make a way to save/recover code
_   make the buildXxxx folders relate to time/date?

low (common errors around reserved names/class naming)
_ Saving sketch with the same name as a class or primitive breaks sketch

_   make history folder, and a zip (not gz) file for each entry
_   history causing trouble - super slow with a huge sketch
_     could instead be gzipped and appended to history.dat
_     along with another file that is actually a table of offsets
_     no need to make the thing a gzip stream
_     checkbox on menu for 'record history' ?
_     history converter option?
_   only first 20 entries visible?
_   shortcut to walk through history, ala photoshop (ctrl-alt-z)
_   zlib file becoming corrupt (not flushed after close?)
_   make hooks to history api so others can write tools around it


PDE / Preferences

_ separate prefs and sketch state info?
_   this would mean prefs being rewritten far less
_ prefs window doesn't swap ok/cancel properly for mac vs. windows/linux
_   don't bother having a "cancel" for the prefs window
_ rewrite preferences window to use proper layout?

_   redo panel to use proper Box layout etc
_   also needs to look good across all platforms
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=73
_ make available the background colors for present mode, stop button color
_   isolate color chooser into a simpler/smaller class outside tools
_   then can also use from inside processing applications as well
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=75
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1130781367;start=2#2
_ add ability to set the display where present mode makes things start
_   code is already in, need to add window and test with multi-monitor setup
_   some code already written in PresentMode.java
_ option in preferences to set the jvm used to run? (osx only?)
_   this would take care of nasty macosx 1.4 vs 1.5 issues
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.3.1/Commands/java
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.2/Commands/java
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Commands/java
_   canonical path for 
_   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK
_   will return 1.5.0 (or maybe 1.6 for others?)


PDE / Runner 

_ draw mode apps do not shut off the run button when finished
_   need to talk to VM and read when 'finished' var is set
_ does closing the window call stop()?
_   need to make sure hitting stop button and closing window explicitly call
_   set finished to true, then join() the animation thread
_ need to set dock icon title on osx


PDE / Present 

_ add option to use full screen exclusive mode on present inside pde?
_   override default setting of macosx (yes) and linux/win (no)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1043
_   linux present mode isn't working properly
_ need to decide how to handle "stop" button in present mode
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=63
_   when running externally, people need to write their own stop function
_   just get export to application working so this can be supported
_   for now, they're stuck w/ running in the env and getting the ugliness
_ quitting from present mode doesn't kill run button
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ ArticulatePrint-070103a.pde from ArticulatePrint-070103a loads ok
_   but when opening the sketch, it leaves out the file
_   because there's a dash in the name
_   and instead only loads StemCell.pde
_ show progress dialog during export and save
_ slow save/new because of large sketchbook
_   this is a total cluster, the rebuild is being called incessantly
_   startup is very slow on g4
_   show progress bar while rebuilding sketch menu?
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1162801212
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1141126582
_   even more of a problem becase set modified set true all the time
_   in 0125, only rebuilding on rename or save as, but still a problem
_   don't re-scan all jar files whenever rebuilding sketch menu (cache)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=579
_ in rebuild sketch menu - disable subfolders working as libraries
_   if a sketch, don't allow subfolders
o   or maybe just that libraries must be in the root? 
o   nah, cuz that would mean can't make subfolder called "libraries"
_ is the 'hide' option for code dumb? i've never used it
_   should it just hide the code, not actually remove it?
_ do we finish the tabs thing for 1.0? yes
_   could probably be done in a reasonable simple way.. ala eclipse
_   show additional tabs in the dropdown list? show all?
_ robert's tunnel example, why does tunnel not show up as leftmost tab?
_ hitting ESC on "create this, move file, continue" opened anyway
_ may need a progress bar for "save as"
_   or just the file copy function in general
_   since it may take a long time (i.e. 1000s of screen grabs)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=82
_ "save as" shouldn't always show save as dialog
_   unless that's the current mode that's being used
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=83
_ handle renaming with case changes (currently ignores case change)
_   see notes/bitching in Sketch.nameCode()
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=85
_ setting sketchbook to a folder on a network mounted drive
_   does this work? test on both on mac and pc.. 
_   or if not, should recommend people against it 
_   (i.e. folders disappearing if net has trouble)
_   http://processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=87
_ some type of sketch archive format for posting examples (.psk?)
_   would be nice to open a sketch directly from a zip file
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=88
_   maybe just open from a zip file, since psk doesn't help anything
_   also have a means of importing sketches

TOOLS / General

_ need a proper means to handle command keys for tools (?)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=140
_ need method for showing prefs for the tools (?)
_   i.e. add pref to handle date vs. increment on archive sketch
_   tools that need prefs will show their own GUI anyway
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=883
_ handle native code for tools menu (?)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=884


TOOLS / Ideas 

_ add a command to launch an external editor
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=141
_ add tool to "Add custom html to sketch"
_   that copies applet.html, 
_   opens sketch folder, 
_   and gives info about what to do next (how to edit)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=143
_ tool to run in appletviewer? sun.applet.Main is appletviewer
_ import sketch from url (takes a zip from archive sketch)
_ archive sketch direct to bug report
_ shared code
_   Integrator / FloatThing / CameraStuff -- Update
_   to pull code from a local folder
_   update will update classes from shared in the current folder


TOOLS / Create Font

E3 _ "create font" is slow, implement a progress indicator
E3 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1464


TOOLS / Color Picker

_ pasting into color picker doesn't update the color values
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=503


TOOLS / Auto Format

_ do a better job of maintaining cursor during beautify 
_   jdf says: a specification would help here!
_ only auto format a particular section of code
_   set the 'tabs' var based on how many spaces on previous line

_ figure out what's up with the qt error handler
_   is this what's preventing the errors from being caught properly?
_   shutting these off for 0116 so hopefully the messages improve

_ reading movie is really really slow (2-3 fps)
_   possible improvement from qtjava list added

_   when drawing large video, the two triangles for the rect are out of sync

_ pause and frameRate aren't working
_   framerate does set the frequency which movieEvent will be called,

_     in fact, speed() should be used to set the rate, not frameRate
_   sketch .zip file in casey's email message
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=370
_ wrong device name for video capture will cause a crash
_ couldn't get req'd component also happens when the capture isn't ready
_   may also mean that no camera is plugged in
_   also, don't mention winvdig on the mac
_ include a separate video class to handle just playback
_   video playback can be much faster if not messing with pixels
_   could instead use texsubimage in opengl, etc
_   only supports tint() (to set alpha or color) and drawing? just drawing?
_ stop button won't kill a video sketch (bug 150 example does this) 
X   although ESC seems to work? (not sure, didn't test)

DIST

How the environment gets packed up, downloaded, and installed.


DIST / General 

_ use macosx dialogs for all of the editor stuff
_   see about doing the same on windows, linux?
_   the others seem to respond ok to the lucida grande since they use defaults
_   vista style dialogs
_     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb328626.aspx
_   confirmation dialogs (save and don't save.. who'd a thunk it)
_     http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511273.aspx
_     http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/Aa511273.Confirmations03(en-us,MSDN.10).png
_   scrollable stack trace
_     http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t19012.html
_ shut off javac warnings
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=812
_ use pack200/unpack200 to make p5 download smaller
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=765
_ drag and drop
_   including the number of items would be especially nice
_ implement automatic update
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=374
_ need .pde document icons
_ need .psk file icon
_ need exported application icons
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known bugs'
_ need more comprehensive list of 'known suggestions'
_ write notes about running p5 on another platforms 
_   this was some feedback from running on bsd:
_     /usr/local/jdk1.3.1/bin/java -cp lib:lib/build:lib/pde.jar:lib/kjc.jar:lib/oro.jar:java/lib/ext/comm.jar PdeBase 
_   need to use the 1.3 vm, and get a fake platform name
_   otherwise, goes looking for lib/pde_.properties or something
_ about box 
_   bring up information about gpl, lgpl, and ibmpl
_   jedit syntax is under mit license
_     http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
_ different name for 'lib' folder because of libraries folder?
_   avoid some confusion for when describing the libraries folder to users
_ remove jvm from cvs
_   use wget to grab it if it doesn't exist
_   and include an md5hash to see if the file is correct


DIST / Windows

2 _ Windows problem with some lab machines "Processing cannot run because 
2 _   it could not create a folder to store your settings"
2 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1016
_ check to see whether this bug is fixed once 0140 is released
_   properly handle non-ascii chars in p5 folder name
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49
_   (could also just warn user to install elsewhere)
o   perhaps the get around this by building into sketch folder
o     when non-ascii chars in use, just launch everything externally
_ icon is skewed on vista 64
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=801
_ "Fatal exception occurred. Program will exit." on startup
_   seems to be font related, deleting prefs will fix it
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=688
_ Processing IDE icon ALT + Tab low res in Windows XP
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1040
4 _ "Could not find the main class: processing.app.Base. Program will exit."
4 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1126
5 _ process still visible in Sysinternals Process Explorer after quit
5 _  http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1567
_ .pde file type not getting associated properly
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1513


DIST / Mac OS X

_ the word from apple on Info.plist setup
DO NOT USE "JVMArchs". It is deprecated, and manually overrides the natural architecture launching and ordering that LaunchServices does, including accommodating the 32-bit checkbox in the Get Info window.
_ instead of "show sketch folder" method, use:
The com.apple.eio.FileManager now has two new desktop interaction methods, revealInFinder(File) and moveToTrash(File). You can use revealInFinder() to open a Finder window in the parent directory of of a file and select it. You can use moveToTrash() to move a file to the most appropriate Trash directory for the volume that contains that file. 
_ setup() and draw() are not bold on osx (10.4)
_   likely osx refuses to do monaco bold
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1047
_ if someone has monaco disabled in font book, the app won't start
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=562
_ we're breaking some mac human interface guidelines
_   should be using a menu factory to create menubar for all sub-windows
_   http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2042.html
_   and the general warning dialogs are just ass ugly
_   (i.e. we really need those replacements for JOptionPane)
_ track down error in PdeCompiler for message parsing
_   was missing the error about a package being gone
_   can comment out /System/Library/ as a test
_ put stdout/stderr into ~/Library/Logs
_   and have a .log extension so it can be browsed properly
_ try LSMinimumSystemVersion in Info.plist
5 _ Horizontal two finger scroll doesn't work in OS X
5 _   also applies to horizontal scrolling on the mouse
5 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1046
5 _ Exiting a sketch with Command-Q or File > Quit doesn't call stop() on OS X
5 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1069
_ add a check to make sure that people aren't running from the dmg
_   doesn't actually cause any problems, so don't bother?


DIST / Linux

5 _ strange insets for PApplet on certain window managers
5 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1187
_ finish up debian package support (see the processing.mess folder)
_   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=596
_   these bits need to be checked to ensure that they work on other distros
5 _ Editor stops receiving keyboard input after running a program (8.10)
5 _   http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1161
_ not being able to make a link to the processing app
_   argh.. more path and shell issues..
_ computationally intensive stuff runs really slow inside p5
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=SoftwareBugs;action=display;num=1116872745
_ some reports of it not quitting properly, but not confirmed
_ splash screen


LATER

_ rename location is awkward, do it on the tab?
_ method of including/excluding data files in the JAR
_   or at least a boolean for the whole folder?
_ should open() not return a Process object? (exec() instead?)
_   pro: can write out error messages (or output)
_   con: loses cross platform ability
_   but: open() is platform specific anyway, ppl can use exec()
