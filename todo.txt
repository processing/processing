X   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1081542378
X fixed one bug in PdeRuntime error message stuff 
X   was this the big one? a big one?

040715 late
X threading issues resolved
X fixed bug with errors not coming through
X fixed bug with errors not being recognized amonst exceptions
X fixed bug with draw mode apps, they now run inside setup
X   width/height wasn't getting set during setup(), so window bad
X moving p5 prefs on mac into documents? or inside sketchbook?
X   Documents -> Processing -> preferences.txt
X   do the same for windows, with sketchbook as a subfolder

040716 evening
o don't exit p5 if platform is unknown
o "save as" needs to update the editorheader
X   couldn't replicate this
X MAJOR: make .pde files embed themselves into the main class
o readUntil() should do the proper thing if the data is not available
o   i.e. either return null, or block until it's available? -> ret null
X "paste" isn't setting the "modified" bit for PdeEditor
X   i.e. cut -> new file -> paste doesn't mark any as changed
X "include all chars" and all the bugs it represents
X working on datatype conversions

040717 
o dll and jnilib files have to be in the p5 folder (confirmed by amit)
o   there should be other places that they work.. 
o   could even copy the dll to the p5 folder from the code folder
o   already fixed with LD_LIBRARY_PATH stuff

040902
X building Processing from scratch 
X   not able to write "preferences.txt" on the first run 

040903
X examples should be in a submenu of open

040905
X "add library" menu item and submenu
X   looks for subfolder called 'libraries' inside p5 folder
X   libraries are determined by having a subfolder named 'library'
X String in apache classes and java.lang
X   maybe ignore classes not inside the p5 libs dir?
o   need to be able to select between which to include
o   auto-resolve by saying java.* wins, others ask
X make built-in libraries read-only

040912 
X several menu changes as discussed with casey 
X   (capitalization, export/export app, tools)
X add preference for showing library stuff

040913 morning
X figure out why user libraries not being added
X in lib mode, show internal libraries as part of the 'open' menu 
X make a note that p5 has to be restarted for libs
X import all libraries into classpath
X   all libs found during sketchbook build + all libs in libraries
X   this means sketchbook menu will need to be rebuilt after lib build
X   append the user's classpath to the end of that

040913 afternoon
X "Processing" folder not properly created on new install

040920
X add noLoop() to static mode apps
X remove "loop" from special inserts on preproc

040921 afternoon 
o when running externally, build into sketch folder?
X add all imported libs to hash table of jars

040921 evening
X lots of work on libraries, figuring out PLibrary api
X   attachLibrary(new libsomething()) and attachLibrary("pitaru.Sonia");
o   final stop() for static shutdown of lib
X     no static init - make the library designers deal with it
X   stop() for individual items
X register pre() and post() calls
X   this would avoid having to patch BApplet
X register for setup() calls
X where do libraries for distribution go?
X   libraries subfolder of p5
X PLibrary lib = attach(new PClient());
X get export working again
X System.out isn't being heard from P* classes
X   errors inside those classes also causing weirdness
X   this might be a broader running as external app problem
X   errorMessage in PSerial/PClient/PServer are all using System.out

040923 late
X write handler for loop() error, warning user to rename loop to draw
X   c:/fry/processing/build/windows/work/lib/build/Temporary_1452_9170.java:29:6:29:11: Semantic Error: The method "void loop();" with default access cannot replace the accessible method "void loop();" with public access declared in type "processing.core.PApplet".

o   http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=120255
X split classes to BVideo and BMovie ? 
X don't force install of qtjava
X   this requires a separate version of bagel that doesn't use video
X   or a version that loads video dynamically. that kinda sucks.
o   maybe could even compile it in with jikes? (blech)
o hangs frequently on the mac (prolly a sync issue)
o   karsten's stuff has same problem
o   but the roger's video tracking does not
X   should be fixed with new synchronization stuff
X video.pixels don't seem to have high bytes set
X   so fill(video.pixels[blah]) doesn't work
X   test against 'pixels' example
X   this is ok.. modify get() for RGB images to set high bits
X make BVideo subclass BImage
o   make sure the high bits are getting set as opaque
X   get() now sets high bits, reference will explain PVideo.pixels[]

X disable "export application"
X font builder
X   properly update the font on new selection
X   update when smooth is sel/desel
X   don't allow negative font sizes
X "create font" not working well with postscript font names

hanging bug
to try: 1) don't use a bufferedreader.. just read it and then use a
buffered reader around the byte array 2) don't do anything with the
input, and just read it off without signalling message()
* it may be something to do with the editor consoles. try shutting off
output to the console and see if it'll still crash.
* most likely related to io streams to the external java process. when
run via a disconnected process, using "cmd /c start java", the thing
will never hang. in that instance, the process terminates almost
immediately, and no i/o needs to happen (since it's a cmd prompt that
never shows up). 
* it could also be a graphics sync bug that just gets more testy
because the environment, a second java process, is running at the same
time. mis.newPixels() may hork since it's over in the applet's thread,
and it might be calling repaint() or Toolkit.sync() to update the
image on-screen. 
* shows up on key presses.. not sure if this is because of the actual
key press, or if it's because they're often accompanied by a println()
* blank spaces in filenames/parent folder often cause trouble.. not
sure if related. same for PATH and CLASSPATH.
* some virus scanning software, particularly older NAV versions cause
the trouble. 


static apps/scripts
_ static applets need to be able to resize themselves on 'play'
_ figure out what to do with static apps exported as application
_   needs to just hang there
_ scripts (w/ no graphics) will need to call exit() explicitly


libraries
_ compiling - main file is a .java not a .pde
_   also where no root .pde file with the same name.. (i.e. video)
_ on "new library" fill in the default code for the lib
_ record imports from java files as well
_ ignore imports from java.* or maybe just things pde's classpath
_ after export of library, rebuild "import library" menu


really nasty bugs (fix in 0070 if possible)
_ threading issues on casey's laptop
_ odd error in System.err stream coming from running external
_   dies after a while or goes weird
_   make sure exceptions with .class work
_ openStream returning 'null' really horked up the letters applet
_   no System.out was coming through
_   System.err was getting cut off before finishing


_ support for editor plugins
_   make dynamically loaded plugins and "tools" menu
_     break out beautify as its own plugin
_   make beautify plugin "Auto Format"
_     //for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

_ include a note that 'applet' folder will get emptied/rewritten
_   or rename the old applet folder to something else? (nah, too messy)


_ redo preferences panel to use proper swing layout etc
_ exception in setup() on external app doesn't kill run button 
_   also doesn't kill external vm
_ make preferences a modal dialog
_ package processing.app for PdeBase, PdeEditor..


_ video - try to replicate bug that causes hang with camera
_   happens when winvdig, camera or quicktime are not properly installed


0071 or later
_ write export-to-application
_   lock feature for present mode (part of export to application?)
_   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
_   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
_   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
_   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works
_   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
_   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
_     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
_   also make sure pack() is happening
_   add manifest.mf to exported applets so that applications will work

_     or even BApplet.main(new String[] { getClass().getName() });
_     META-INF/MANIFEST.MF contains just "Main-Class: ClassName"
_     main sticking point will be serial/qtjava in exports
_ write export-to-library
_   need to be able to produce the serial, video, etc libs
_   see if sonia project can compile
_ implement horizontal version of PdeEditorButtons
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1076707944
o   is PdeEditorHeader one pixel too tall?
_ menu option for Renderer > to "Core" or "OpenGL"
_   on export, uses this setting to determine if jogl is added to project
_ add a "make archive" option
_   doesn't rename sketch, just names zip file sketch + time stamp
_ need showError/Message/Warning/Prompt design from casey
_   maybe something that shows stack trace?
_   with an 'email this' button? (include source code too?)
_   also need a "prompt" dialog for asking filenames, etc
_   implement and remove PdeEditorStatus stuff

FRY

My grab of examples/libraries that I'd like to make. Most of these are
things I've already written in some form or another, but need to take
the time to package up and release.

_ example showing quicksort code
_   and how to implement/use as an inner class
_ arcball
_ joystick
_ particles (from multip?)
_ phyics & collisions
_   look at the 'havoc' physics library
_ java3d classes for vec3f and matrix
_ quicktime exporter or image sequence export
_   fairly quick--just use experimental code from dbn
_ more advanced splitting of files into rows/cols uses another class
_   other class also has concept for random access of lines
_   by storing the line positions, can access without loading all
_   into memory because some files will be too large
_   read table/csv formatted data into a matrix
_     pseudo-database format version of this that stores indexes to file
_       rather than loading the whole thing at once
_ history.. add my diffs sketch (as a plug-in)
_   could just include a compiled version of the diff app, ala jikes
_ something about using regexps in p5
_   wrap up oro for simple matching
_   (as alternative to the sun classes.. link to those in the docs)
_ method for file handling, recursive walk-through a directory
_   file i/o: file listing util that leaves out . and ..

more random thoughts
_ stroke picker
_   just lineweight, so don't bother.. use constants palette instead
_ font picker
_   same thing, just quickly generates fonts on the fly and applies them
_ need to look at matlab's visualization tools
_ arcs, better 'color' object
_ take everything in perl cookbook, and make easy to do with p5
_ database access and reading large files are always hangups
_ support capabilities of matlab's visualization tools
_ charting/labeling primitives.. excel never quite does it
_ botting engine
_ difficulty of initial grab/analysis of data, that may take some time
_   then needs to be stored and run on multiple times
_ methods for picking colors.. how to color code, limit to 5? gradients..
_ simple way to do tufte-style small multiples on an app
_ function for reporting percent finished (or swing dialog)
_ also for reporting the amount of time remaining
_ loading/selecting a file (or folder), or from command line
_ load large file as lattice (option of whether to keep in memory)
_   how many rows/columns for headings
_ walking through an entire directory, with a handler
_   that throws out the . and .. items
_   that knows about aliases (jdk13)
_ overall contrast/color control (genomevalence for hulk)
_ mac -> vlw (or sbit?) font converter
_   need to also read the fond for metrics
_ general bitmap font editor, see what chars are in font, etc
