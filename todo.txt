_ color() should work for alpha.. 
_   also #aarrggbb

_ crap, something i'm forgetting

_ smooth images drawing strangely (missing first line of pixels)
_   also smoothed even if not distorted

_ aliased and anti-aliased images don't line up
_   text (text04) marching around strangely

_ problems with u/v are likely to also be there for colors

_ u/v should be affected by w for proper perspective

_ sphere() and other polygons don't connect flush with one another


_ single pixel lines have no alpha and no z

_ fix all the random line types to support alpha

_ write code for line joins.. continuous lines should become polygon snake

_ convex/concave polygons

image(img, x, y) in CENTER_DIAMETER mode is actually center radius,
because it uses 


//// 


_ beautify() ignores colons for case statements
_   need to tie this to the parser instead

_ rename doesn't set focus to renamer area

_ rename sketch 'can't rename' error (file being kept open)
_   open sketch, make a change, save, run, rename -> error

_ add keyCode to BApplet

_ simage() is screwy.. 
_   its invocation is broken (image_mode can't be two things at once)
_   doesn't actually use image_mode for placement
_   also doesn't support RGBA

_ text caret goes missing
_   removing extra jre's, uninstalling java apps fixed it

_ versions of loadStream/loadBytes etc that use streams and/or urls

_ environment locks up when error stream isn't for the class
_   this happens when it's another thread (i.e. image fetcher)
_   exceptions in KjcEngine (formerly 'ex found in run') should be cleaner

_ people like downloadable reference + net isn't cheap everywhere

_ merge bboard groupings (syntax + programs)
_   separate bboard and environment

data things for my own work, but also generally useful
_ numberFormat too much, use nf
_   how to include space for - or +
_   how to do without zeroes
_ need some model for i/o that makes more sense
_   getting whole words from serial, network, and files
_   or buffers of specific length with a sync byte
_ break out BSerial as separate object like BVideo
_   BSerial.flush and BSerial.available
_ file output, save strings or pile of bytes
_ quicksort should probably just be made into 'sort' class
_   it's the only one ever used
_   can this be done using an inner class?
_ read table/csv formatted data into a matrix
_   pseudo-database format version of this that stores indexes to file
_     rather than loading the whole thing at once
_ more advanced splitting of files into rows/cols uses another class
_   other class also has concept for random access of lines
_   by storing the line positions, can access without loading all
_   into memory because some files will be too large
_ does a[3] == Float.NaN work? (for testing with splitFloats)

GRAPHICS LIBRARY

A hybrid of OpenGL (3D Graphics) and some aspects of Postscript (Fill, Stroke)
The graphics library is called Bagel, which is an internal name.


BAGEL / Bugs

   b _ bezier is broken for > 4 points
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1042201137


BAGEL / Graphics API Additions

   b _     right now it's hardwired at 20, should be adjustable
   b _   function to evaluate bezier or catmullrom points
   b _     used heavily in genome valence, asked about on the bboard

   b _ background(BImage)
   b _   also creating background image inside setup()

   b _ make bagel usable on its own as a drawing surface
   b _   needs to be used as a component, without applet 
   b _   but retain functionality, ie. image i/o
   b _   exports pixels or a BImage or does MemoryImageSource itself
   b _   move math functions into utility library associated
   b _     with bagel, because those will be useful on other bagel platforms
   b _     pApplet will call BagelMath.whatever, so still looks like cos()

   b _ light(x, y, z, c1, c2, c3, TYPE)
   b _   also BLight with same constructor, and on() and off() fxn


BAGEL / Rendering

   b _ anti-aliasing. smooth(), noSmooth()

   b _   what is the API for picking?
   b _   ability to write data other than image into the buffer
   b _   user can introduce new kinds of buffers at will (!)
   b _   lists of names of objects, or the 'line number' buffer
   b _   but how to determine *where* on object the hit occurs?

   b _ concave/complex polygon
   b _   eventually POLYGON auto-detects convex/concave polygon
   b _   also add POLYGON_CONVEX and POLYGON_CONCAVE

   b _   NullPointerException apparently when things way offscreen
   b _     i.e. glyphrot with scale set to 4
   b _     or at least that things get ridiculously slow
   b _     clipping issues here.. but also something in scan converter
   b _     not clipping areas from offscreen
   b _       huge geometry slows things way down

   b _ get font things sewn up 
   b _   create a simple generator for grayscale bdf fonts
   b _     document the change and make several of them
   b _   font smoothing (unless hint SMOOTH_IMAGES enabled) is broken

   b _ lines
   b _   rewrite line and stroke code, it's a buggy mess
   b _     lines become 2 pixels thick after a 3D transform 
   b _     better handling of single-pixel special case
   b _   setting stroke width on circle makes odd patterns
   b _   make sure line() commands don't try to have a fill
   b _   box is not opaque
   b X     problem is that lines are drawn second
   b X     one pixel lines have no z value.. argh
   b _     bug re: 3d depth sorting on lines
   b _     http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1043894019;start=0
   b _     http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1042004618

bf b _   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
bf b _     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl
bf b _   version of ProcessingApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.


BAGEL / Details

   b _ getting mouse movement outside the window
   b _ transparent gif images don't retain transparency (oy)
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=general;action=display;num=1044908359;start=0
   b _ gaps in lines for pmouseX, mouseX
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1044438078;start=0
   b _ too many push() will silently stop the applet inside a loop
   b _   test winding polygons in different directions
   b _   test lighting to see how it compares with gl
   b _   better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
   b _   is quad strip broken or not behaving as expected?
   b _     may be correct, it worked for nik
   b _ draw mode issues.. size and background must be int/float constants
   b _   might be a better 'mode' for bagel so bkg and size cmds work
   b _   rather than app being enclosed in beginFrame/endFrame loop
   b _ why is every other pixel missing from mouse events?
   b _ images drawn from center don't work for simage()
   b _   currently calling slower image routine

   2 _ keypressed is not persistent
   2 _   key repeat in os vs. how java handles it
   2 _   search java faq for info about getting around it


BAGEL / Future

   2 _ nicer/simpler api for moving the camera around
   2 _ better api for fonts
   2 _ line endcaps and line joins. strokeMode()
   2 _ fixed fonts are screwed, should only work at screen resolution
   2 _   getStream for the filename doesn't work for directories
   2 _     getfont("fonts/blah.fbf") refers to blah.raw, but that
   2 _     also needs to be searched for in the fonts/ dir..
   2 _ try with 1.4 frame buffer stuff to see if it's faster
   2 _ write shearing function
   2 _ adaptive sizing of circle segmenting based on rendered size
   2 _   rather than requiring a fixed amount
   2 _   have a few settings cached
   2 _ optimize rotation functions
   2 _ update/noUpdate() could also be done to force explicit updates only
   2 _   for ui-type applications that don't need to continually redraw
   2 _   instead use void update() as a function like loop and draw
   2 _   third mode for interactive apps that have to be queried
   2 _   shouldn't do so much work (redrawing in loop) if waiting for input
   2 _     mode for when no full animation taking place
   2 _     otherwise machine is continually maxed out while app is running

   2 _ way to screen grab at higher resolution
   2 _   method for rendering at higher res and then scaling down
   2 _   (even if this causes signficant performance hit)
   2 _ look at GLUT for other needed shapes
   2 _ export to static flash-based graphics
   2 _ build in second matrix type: 2d affine
   2 _ write code for reading uncompressed b/w tiff images
   2 _   incorporate for fixed width fonts
   2 _ fast(er?) version of bagel that just uses java graphics
   2 _   but leaves out many features
   2 _ setting a fill color when drawing an image should affect the image
   2 _   or maybe image.setColor or setTone to mix a specific color in

VIDEO 


VIDEO / CAPTURE - Bagel Standard Extension by Hernando

hb b _ beginVideo()
hb b _ endVideo()
hb b _ videoMode() 
hb b _ videoEvent(); 
hb b _ video[] 

bf b _ incorporate hernando's code
bf b _   add qt java libs to build process
   b _ do same as video capture but running through movie file


VIDEO / Output - something like screengrab, employs qtjava

   b _ quicktime exporter or image sequence export
   b _   fairly quick--just use experimental code from dbn

PDE - PROCESSING DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT



PDE / General 

bf b _ separate compiler from other kjc-specific code
bf b _   change writeJava/start functions to be combined in kjc
bf b _   but the rest inside PdeEditor that takes care of launching/placing
   b _ be able to draw something inside setup (?)
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Syntax;action=display;num=1044689650;start=0


PDE / Pre-preprocessor 
Currently using Oro for search and replace preprocessor.
Future plans to use Javacup for preprocessor and Jikes for compiler.

_ setup( ){} has an error, setup(){} does not
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1045059758;start=0
_   setup (200, 200) causes the default size to be used but setup(200, 200) works fine
_ no longer require size() to come first.
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1038368420
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1028560140
_ separate preprocessor from other kjc-specific code 
_ compiler barfs on: float[] moo = new int[10];  
_   although no error comes through to p5 (benelek)
_ switch to java cup (one day's work)
_   subst Image -> BImage, Font -> BFont
_ syntax coloring of built-in java objects.. i.e. String
_   probably want to include everything that's in java.lang and maybe others
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1045665326


PDE / Compiler

   b _ see if newer javac forces a System.exit() or if it can be avoided
   b _ wire-in jikes as another compiler
   b _   write handlers for jikes-style of error messages


PDE / KJC Compiler
most of these items can be removed if kjc is dropped
o
   b _ when missing a closed brace, often has compiler error
   b _   Jordan J message in email and bugs list
   b _ can't used random() inside constructor.. (Glen Murphy)
   b _   maybe related to problems loading images in constructors
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1039411135
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1038807934
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1029289775
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1047649496;start=0
   b _ weird comments bug (external file)
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1040466898
   b _ kjc is really frustrating about some of its error/warning msgs
   b _   erroneous errors from kjc regarding 'var not inited'
   b _     is there any way to disable this message?
   b _   talk to simon about error streams and kjc
   b _     better piping of output from kjc
   b _     modify kjc to take a PrintWriter, instead of current hacks
   b _   might be able to set default values for vars using perl5subst
   b _   Compiler.disable() message is weird and doesn't always work
   b _     probably just remove it for now


PDE / Export

   b _ export to .pde file rather than java
   b _   or at least link to that from the web page
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1046250912
   b _ add manifest.mf to exported applets so that applications will work
   b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1045983103;start=0
   b _ ability to export 'applications' (not just applets)
   b _   lock feature for present mode (part of export to application?)
   b _   application can still do serial (qt, other stuff?) 
   b _   applet runs in browser, though applet on cbagel is everything..
   b _   include main class info for executable jar file with jdk > 1.2
   b _   not difficult to do, just some tweaking once applet export works
   b _   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
   b _   main() method needs to set layout manager if jexegen is to be used
   b _     (msft vm defaults to null layout manager)
   b _   also make sure pack() is happening


PDE / Runtime (includes classloading)

_ for 'java' mode, try run using external vm
_   would need to get error output stream from app.. argh
_   only allow under win/osx/linux
_   not clear how to kill the process.. does that work w/ 1.3?
_ support 'classes' folder, through the use of a classloader
_   could also be done by launching external java app
_   all .jar files etc are added from this folder automatically
_ class unloading not happening in java mode
_   need to add randomizer to even non-self gen'd classes
_   or figure out how to unload old classes.. grr
_ lockup when something missing from classpath on dynamic load
_   but makes no error.. peditorconsole probably swallowing it
_ ability to include other code from sketchbook directory
_   compile entire sketchbook on startup, check for new files on compile?


PDE / Details

_ improve the console
_   maybe it needs to be a textarea?
_   printing of objects, esp when null, in jdk 14 seems to crash
_   exception when trying to write to stdout
_   can't copy text from console directly
_ need to check if volume is read-only, notify and quit if it is
_   people are trying to run off the disk image
_   need to pay attention to when running from read-only drive
_     reported by brandenberg
_    "p5 will launch from the disk image, but will 
_     not draw the sketch name bar doesn't appear"
_ p5 becomes a memory hog (benelek and glen murphy)
_   even without sketches open, perhaps not gc'ing properly
_ save last-used serial to sketch.properties on quit
_ size() has memory limitations (pitaru)
_   catch OutOfMemoryError inside size() and let the user know
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1038847001
_ 'save as' from examples puts into examples dir.. :(
_   make it default to the user's sketch dir
_ verify editor buttons working properly
_   is play button properly unhighlighting? 
_     does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
_     also when using draw() instead of loop()
_       applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_   popup menu for sketches doesn't unhighlight if no sketch selected
_   if export fails (compile error) need deselect
_ only copy data files into build dir when there are changes
_   make sure the still relevant files aren't removed
_   setLastModified on the files after copying (jdk13)
_ better handling of AccessControlException in applets
_   on loadImage and loadStream
_ exceptions in draw() apps aren't caught
_   the program resize(200, 200); just does nothing (doesn't complain)
_ if 'void' left out before loop or setup, cryptic message about
_   'constructor loop must be named Temporary_23498_2343'
_   add a better handler for this specific thing?
_ sketches can't be named starting with numbers (D.YOO)
_   either provide an error message or explanation for this
_   or allow the sketch name to be separte from the class/folder names
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1033674118


PDE / Details (low priority)

_ menu weirdness (benelek)
_   when u've got a menu open, move a cursor over the text area
_   and back over the menu, the text-area cursor type remains. 
_   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1043667859
_ scroll bar has some painting weirdness with jedit textarea

b _ event to explorer to open 'parts' directory of project
b _ expose access to oro api, perhaps as a plugin
b _   regexps: http://javaregex.com/cgi-bin/pat/tutorial.asp


2 _ menu option to change username/login
2 _   if new user, offer to rename 'default' if it contains things
2 _ user name is changed by clicking and typing
2 _   after user hits 'enter', checks to see if user exists
2 _     if not, pops up message asking if they want to change
2 _       message goes in same spot as error/status label (turns yellow?)
2 _     if user says 'no', then 
2 _ method of collapsing history for useful versions
2 _   archive associated files as well.. data/etc
2 _ see about setting up simple bug tracker/feature system
2 _   // We can use sourceforge for bug tracking... (reas)
2 _   queue for people reporting things externally
2 _   bugzilla but simpler
2 _   would also be nice for people to be able to vote on features
2 _ run java code besides processing applets 
2 _   if not processing applet, look for a main(), no main give an error
2 _ dbn2p5 converter.. ooh!
2 _ a better editor: 
2 _   line numbers like bbedit
2 _   syntax coloring
2 _   emacs indents and key commands
2 _   http://mathsrv.ku-eichstaett.de/MGF/homes/grothmann/je/index.html
2 _   want emacs-style editor that's faster loading than emacs
2 _ tweak updater a little bit so it's more likely to work
2 _   use numbered versioning? 
2 _   give updater feedback (progress dialog, error msg)
2 _ error messages with link to what's wrong
2 _ lots of ui ideas from adrien in the bboard
2 _ some ui stuff from fdb
2 _   rename the button options to verbs

DISTRIBUTION

How the environment gets packed up, downloaded, and installed.


DISTRIBUTION / General 
b _ need document icons  
b _ beta release will include source code
b _ write notes about running p5 on another platforms 
b _   this was some feedback from running on bsd:
b _   /usr/local/jdk1.3.1/bin/java -cp lib:lib/build:lib/pde.jar:lib/kjc.jar:lib/oro.jar:java/lib/ext/comm.jar PdeBase 
b _   need to use the 1.3 vm, and get a fake platform name
b _   otherwise, goes looking for lib/pde_.properties or something


DISTRIBUTION / Windows
b _ need splash screen, startup takes a long time
b _   file association for .pde files
b _ windows 95/98/ME seems to be broken
b _   ME doesn't seem to like the .exe, but run.bat worked ok
b _   http://proce55ing.net/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_software_bugs;action=display;num=1028990066
b _ lockup/freezes (mKoser and zeitgeist)

running 1.4 from the command line:
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.1/Commands/java 
Info.plist, setting JVMVersion
* 1.3.1 - only use JDK 1.3.1, even if later versions are available. 
* 1.3* - use any version of JDK 1.3.x. Do not use JDK 1.4 even if it's dflt.
* 1.3+ - use the latest JDK version from JDK 1.3 onward, up to default JDK. 
* 1.4+ - use JDK 1.4 or later, even if an earlier JDK is the default. 


DISTRIBUTION / Linux
b _ splash screen
b _ test serial with ibm vm and all
b _ look for jdk 1.4 to use instead of 1.3
b _   make sure javacomm gets in there
b _ test it a little more to make sure it works (cygwin x sucks)

casey -- this is a bunch of crap that i've scribbled down as i've
thought of it.. maybe they should be moved to your list or removed if
they're not useful?


DOCS
_ mention connection to java and docs on getting started in java
_ make clear that setup is just for setup
_   but should also in the future allow to create static image

  // I don't know where this should live, on BBS? What do you think
_ p5 faq items: re midi support, msgs w/ adam hoyle in mail folder
_   also 'why p5' message from amit pitaru on 12/15/02
_     and p5 versus flash stuff
_   lists the main arguments, could be a useful document
_ list of reserved keywords

LANGUAGE

Adding to the API for advanced users, supporting concise coding


foreach String line (lines)
foreach (String line = lines)
foreach (String line, lines)
foreach (String line) of lines
..would translate to..
for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    String line = lines[i];
}

for (int i = 0..10)  or  for (int i, 0..10)
foreach (int i) of 0..10
for (int i = start..stop)
..translating to..
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)   
for (int i = start; i < stop; i++)

emit(arrayImageX) or printvar? or vprint?
..would translate to..
println("arrayImageX = " + arrayImageX);

emit(arrayImageX, arrayImageY)
..would translate to..
println("arrayImageX, arrayImageY = " + arrayImageX + ", " + arrayImageY)

BXSound, BXSampler or BXAudio
  play aiff or mp3 sound with a single command
  play buffer of samples with a single command
  full class allows play/pause/more advanced loading

BXMovieInput/Output or BXVideo or BXQuickTimeOutput/Input
  BXMovie and BXCamera?

BXImageIO, BXTiffImage

BXDataFile (csv or tab separated data)
  BXDataMatrix

BXDatabase, BXDatabaseCache (keeps queries to fill out table)

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES


Things that break often/things to test
_ handling of key events (both as applet and in application)
_ per-vertex coloring for different kinds of shapes
_ that each shape type works as expected
_   what if one short or one too many vertices?
_ transforms are affecting geometry
_   i.e. are line and point working in 3D?
_ why did i think that z was backwards from gl?

biggest problems from french workshop
_ syntax more difficult than expected: semicolons and braces
_   part is translation issue--wasn't a quick fix
_ curly braces weren't on the keyboard
_ encouraging people to indent their code for clarity
_ slow to understand 'blocks'
_   translation issue but could be aided by visual cues in editor
_   might be better to use braces on separate lines to reinforce
_ couldn't enforce people working on specific exercises
_ too many cubes.. people playing with 3d before understanding it
_ would be nice to have examples for all concepts on site
_   or in a small printed book that serves as a reference
_ courseware not complete--difficult to collect assignments

teaching 3D
_ expectation for 3D objects is that they begin in the center
_   rather than a translate(W/2, H/2) then draw rotating cube

_ make processing useful/usable
_   start working on writing pdf files
_   loading images/files from same dir as .pde file
_   option to use jikes
_   use external editor or write a usable one
_ write simple class for lcd panel 
_   build adapter to plug directly into db9 serial port
_   figure out characters used on screen by default (check web)
_   make unicode converter from unicode char -> lcd screen bytes
_   hook up lcd screen to power/serial port to test
_   code to reprogram lcd screen
_ look through rabbit api
_   look into integration of cmd line compiler
_ check out flash for its text editor
_ write function to swap different names for Proce55ing
_   use for window title
_   simple app that does swapping of letters as an animation

also an interesting possibility (for tech-minded only)
  use terminal emulator, and run iostream from process
  use pooterm stuff for the emulation window
  key commands would conflict
  but could use emacs under osx, linux
  use nano (maybe emacs?) under windows
  and nothing for macos9

BUILDING P5

where to install jikes, jre, others?
jre may need to be back in cvs, but annoying for dist
because of all the CVS directories that it makes

cvs co processing
cd processing
cvs update -P
# optional, if you're only doing java dev
rm -rf web 

need to have rt.jar from jdk 1.1 and comm.jar in the CLASSPATH 
to build bagel.. just gotta be that way, it's too messy otherwise

need cygwin: zip, unzip, perl
little guys: rm, cp, mv, tcsh

build jikes for cygwin, use version 1.14, later than that has bugs
./configure, make, make install
add $cygwin/usr/local/bin to path

dist directories contain only the files specific to that platform
(those are the ones checked into cvs)
  when dist.sh is run:
  1) a copy of the dist dir is created, renamed 'processing-nnnn'
  2) the remaining files are added (buttons.gif, pde.properties)
  3) files are lf converted (i.e. notes.txt)
comm.jar now needs to be in CLASSPATH for build environment

macos may be superior platform for building
  retain unix file permissions for linux
  resource fork goodness for the mac

for jgl version of bagel, jgl.jar needs to be in classpath

(C)BAGEL WORK

The C Language version of the Bagel Graphics Library


_ modify cbagel for opie
_ would be interesting to build pre-processor for java p5
_   but that converts into cpp version of bagel apps.. mmm
_ update cbagel to current bagel status
_ get gcc tied into processing
_ java disassembly inside p5
_   and assmebling it back again
_ color() has a different meaning
_   formerly a normalized 0..1 float to a packed rgb int
_   now it's a color according to current standards
_   float_color is a private version of the previous color()
_ curve was broken (cvertexIndex being reset)
_   curve() now doubles start/end points to be more logical
_   (fits all four points by drawing six points)
_ try screengrab using malloc and/or gobs of extra memory
_   debug the version inside bagel b/c it's simpler
_ bagel needs to be able to resize itself
_   also to address screen as if it's another size
_     is that simply a matter of changing the viewport?
_   letterboxing as appropriate
_ build windows app for testing bagel c++ ... -lgdi32 for cygwin
_ updates from p5 api changes
_   triangle() 6 parameters
_   quad() 8 parameters
_   rect/rectMode again
_   new color solution
_     color() -> uses colorMode
_     red/green/blue() hue/saturation/value() functions
_     getPixel/setPixel
_     swap in 'color' as an int
_     color c = #67aa78
_   keyDown(), mouseDown(), lastMouseX, lastMouseY
_   degrees(), radians()
_ fill, background, stroke all with int version for packed rgb

_ why won't glut shut up about modifiers?
_ add millis() to bappletgl that returns glut millis

_ BGL_PATH should turn paths into os9 ready paths for os9
_ or whatever else for the other platforms
_ macos9: font = loadFont(":fonts:Univers55.vlw");
_ or could use a "File" style object
_   or do all path conversions internally:
_   loadFont, loadImage.. already do gz decoding

_ makingmovie/screengrab should be moved into bapplet, 
_ along with the stuff for making an ai screen grab

_ mouseX/lastMouseX should be handled automatically
_ mousePressed() function may not need vars passed in
_ or maybe the only vars are alt/left-right/ctrl/shift

_ maybe mouseevent is passed in, but not used in the
_ function unless people want advanced features
_ mouseX/mouseY/lastMouseX/lastMouseY all set by parent class

_ lastKey and lastKeyCode -- not as useful as the mouse stuff
