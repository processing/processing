I'm totally confused about how mouseDown keyDown mouseUp keyUp is supposed to be working so i can't document it. do you have simple examples?
below is what i've been trying:

int mx = 0;
int my = 0;
void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  background(102);
}
void loop() {
  rect(mx, my, 50, 50);
}
//public void mouseDown(int x, int y) {
//  mx = x;
//  my = y;
//}
//public boolean mouseDown(Event e, int x, int y) {
//  mx = x;
//  my = y;
//  return true;
//}
public void mouseDown(int x, int y, int button) {
  mx = x;
  my = y;
}

Notes from Version 37 -- PC Windows2000 Professional

Frequently i'll trying to play a program with an error. Proce55ing will tell me that i have a syntax error. I will correct the error, but when i hit run it then give me a sequence of error text:
Exception occurred during event dispatching:
java.lang.NullPointerException

if you quit the environment and then repost in the code it will run fine.

for example run this problematic code:
ex. 
color rr = #FFCC00;
fill(255);
rect(20, 20, 50, 50);
fill(rr);
rect(50, 50, 50, 50);

then fix the error and run again:
//ex. 
color rr = #FFCC00;
fill(255);
rect(20, 20, 50, 50);
fill(rr);
rect(50, 50, 50, 50);

history is super cool. no problems yet with it.

/ / / / / / / / / /
the "double" bug is back
proce55ing thinks the following numbers are a double:
float a = .5;
float b = 0.5;

/ / / / / / / / / /
when you click on the link for proce55ing reference it should take you to the index page, not the environment page

background() is not working

not working here:
size(200, 200);
background(255, 255, 255);
fill(255, 204, 0);
rect(30, 20, 50, 50);

but is working here:
void setup() {
  size(200, 200);
  background(255, 255, 255);
}
void loop() {
  noStroke();
  fill(255, 204, 0);
  rect(30, 20, 50, 50);
}

/ / / / / / / / / /
fill() is not detecting if an int or color is being passed in...

ex.
color cc = #ffcc00;
fill(cc);
rect(30, 20, 55, 55);

Notes from Version 36


///////////////////////////////////

after an applet with an image exports, it will load fine once, but not
after?
the applet loads fine the first time and displays the image, but when you
hard refresh, it only displays a black box in the place the image was. it
will not longer load.
actually soft refresh is fine but fn-refresh kills the images. after this
point, no images will load. if explorer is restarted the problem is fixed.

///////////////////////////////////

in advanced mode (java mode) you have to quit p5 and reopen to see changes
to the code. if you make a change and hit run button, the change is not
visible


///////////////////////////////////

the fill() method with one parameter is not distinguishing if the one parameter is an int of the datatype color. need to check the first four bits i think.

ex. 
color rr = #FFCC00;
fill(255);
rect(20, 20, 50, 50);
fill(rr);
rect(50, 50, 50, 50);


///////////////////////////////////


Notes from Version 35

///////////////////////////////////

Tag -- I'm it. Clean and review all documentation. Examples.

///////////////////////////////////
HIGH PRIORITY

background() is not working

curveVertex() is not behaving like curve(). is this your intention?

imageMode() seems to be gone


///////////////////////////////////

LOW PRIORITY

setPixel(i, j, #99CC00); // not working anymore Syntax error: unexpected token: CC00

when the image is 100x100 or so and the window is 120x120, the mouse calls are off when the cursor enters and leaves the upper left corner.
ex.
void setup() { size(100,100); }
void loop() {
  fill(102);
  rect(mouseX - 5, mouseY - 5, 10, 10);
}


triangle_strip, quad_strip are no filling without outlines
ex.
fill(204, 204, 0);
beginShape(TRIANGLE_STRIP);
vertex(30, 75);
vertex(40, 20);
vertex(50, 75);
vertex(60, 20);
vertex(70, 75);
vertex(80, 20);
vertex(90, 75);
endShape();

There should be an option to "delete" in file menu (the list can get really long)

How is the number chosen for sketch_??? (it seems random when "new" activated)

box is not opaque
ex.
translate(58, 48, 0); 
rotateY(0.5);
box(40);

if there is no call to size() in setup(), could there be a default size?


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

more bugs for version35

if an image name has a number in it, it will not load

after an applet with an image exports, it will load fine once, but not after? 
it seems that each image will load into the browser once, but no more.
the applet loads fine the first time and displays the image, but when you hard refresh, it only displays a black box in the place the image was. it will not longer load.
actually soft refresh is fine but fn-refresh kills the images. after this point, no images will load. if explorer is restarted the problem is fixed.

in advanced mode (java mode) you have to quit p5 and reopen to see changes to the code. if you make a change and hit run button, the change is not visible

questions for documentation
are images included in the .jar on export to applet?


Fun. Export sketchbook. 

Exports the entire contents of the sketchbook to a web presentation...

    the center points of various shapes that are being drawn
_ _ Should basic math function like abs() should have an int prototype
_ _ What are we doing about convex polygons?
_ _ A key command for inserting function prototypes, such as ctl-f to add a for loop
_ _ Make a second version of all drawing primitives that are objects so you can:
      rectangle.height = 55;
      rectangle.height = 120;
      rectangle.angle = PI;
_ _ mouseX, mouseY, width, height, pmouseX, pmouseY should be reserved and create errors when people try to assign them (l-value error?)
_ _ Should we discuss bitwise operators?
_ _ I don't think the links to Proce55ing.net and Reference should be in the "file" menu

Proce55ing Concepts (both technical and design)
  Coordinate systems (Cartisian, <<radial>> )(object coordinates vs. environmental)
  Data ?? or is this broken down into array, variable
  File
  Color (different spaces and mappings)
  Algebra
  Parameterized form
  Curves (Bezier vs Catmull-Rom, other)
  Trigonometry/Geometry
  Abstraction
  Transformations |using Push and Pop| matrix stack...
  Algorithm
  Analog vs. Digital
  Object-Oriented design
  Vector vs. Raster ( a matter of prepresentation, not form )
  I/O (Serial Communication . also USB...)

  Image (signal) processing
  Computer as a generalized system (big computer, small computer)
  Array
  Variable

  Other potential Concepts:
  Artificial Life
  Artificial Intelligence
  Network
  Multiuser


  There should be a series of tools written (in processing) that help elucidate the concepts
  Color picker, Transformations, Curves, Coordinates, Trigonometry, Parameterized form


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

THE BOOK

How do I discuss the larger issues of interaction, motion, form, structure???
A. This is primarily a design/art book. These are the major issues supported through technical discussion

It's not about "how to design" but how to think about design within the context of programmatic media
Or is it programming within the context of design/art. with design/art as a subtext...
NO is is definately about the media. interactive media. with programming being essential for support
A synthesis or aesthetics and technique. A synthesis of theory and practice...

I need to find three excellent sources for each of these concepts...
Kernigan & Ritchie, Petzhold, Hillis, Foley and vanDamn, Algorithms, Lev Manevich

The reference section explains how something is done and provides definitions
The concepts section explains a concept from scratch in detail and in context

Both the reference and the examples refer to the topics...
The reference can allude to the concepts, but act as a refresher. Concepts "teach" from scratch.
This is a nonlinear book...
Concepts also refer to certain examples...

Have a alphabetical reference of methods all keywords that maps to the reference structure
Include the general reference in the book, but not the technical reference

Proce55ing exists outside of the continually shifting commercial software market

Remember to develop a dictionary. Terminology is an important part of learning

throughout the book, different feels. should not feel like
proce55ing is a tool for only one style
  a. clean flat (casey)
  b. data viz (ben)
  c. drawings+photocopy (rough)
  d. photographic polish

?? Should arguments be called parameters?

computers treat numbers in a mathematical way, 
but we don't perceive color this way. for us, color perception is relative...
we adapt our perception to the context of the environment...
